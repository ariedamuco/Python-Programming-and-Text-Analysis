Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as we approach the end of another Congress, we bid farewell to those Senators who will not be returning in January. Today I wish to say farewell to a good friend and one of the most honorable and respected members of this body--Dale Bumpers. 
Dale Bumpers is the epitome of what a Senator should be. He entered public service because he believed that it was a noble profession, and throughout his political career he has performed his duties with the highest levels of integrity and decency. He has always been guided by his heart and his mind, not by any polls. 
He almost seems like a character from a Frank Capra film. He was a World War II veteran from a small town who attended college and law school on the G.I. Bill. After practicing law for 20 years in his home town, he earned a reputation as a political giant-killer on his way to the Governor's mansion and eventually the Senate. Even his home address seems straight out of Hollywood. Believe it or not, he actually lives on a street named Honesty Way. 
Oftentimes when you're watching Dale Bumpers speak from the Senate floor, you can't help but think of the character made famous by Jimmy Stewart--Senator Jefferson Smith--whose political philosophy was `the only causes worth fighting for are lost causes,' and whose most famous line was, `Either I'm dead right, or I'm crazy.' 
As Senator Bumpers said just the other day on this floor, he's probably fought more losing battles than any other Senator. I can picture Senator Bumpers right now, speaking from the heart on some issue about which he cares very deeply. He knows that he's right, but whatever he says, he can't seem to sway a majority of his colleagues. But no matter what, he won't give up. He won't back down. And in 18 years of serving with Dale Bumpers, I can honestly say that I never saw him waver in his beliefs or back down from a good, honest debate. 
Two years ago, when Dale Bumpers was speaking on the retirement of his former colleague from Arkansas, David Pryor, he said, and I quote, `I am not a terribly effective legislator because I have a very difficult time compromising. I have strong beliefs, and sometimes compromise is just out of the question for me.' 
Maybe there is some truth to that statement. Maybe Dale Bumpers could have scored a few more political victories if he had been more willing to compromise. 
But I think that my friend from Arkansas is being a little hard on himself in his self-assessment. I think that he is an excellent legislator, and it was his candor and his devotion to his convictions that made him effective. Obviously, compromise is often essential to getting things done around here. But equally essential is having people around here who are passionate about issues and willing to fight for their beliefs in the face of opposition. 
Dale Bumpers is not only thought of highly by his colleagues, but I think that everyone in the entire Senate family thinks fondly of this man. And I know for a fact that many members of my staff share a deep admiration for Senator Bumpers. 
The past few weeks, there has actually been a `Dale Bumpers watch' in the L.A. room in my office, much like the Mark McGwire watch that captivated the country during the baseball season. Every time Senator Bumpers has come to the floor, hands have pulled back from keyboards and the volumes on television sets have been turned up, as my staffers have watched and wondered if this would be the last time that Dale Bumpers will speak on the Senate floor. I only hope that they were watching C-SPAN on the afternoon of Saturday, October 10. 
Of course, Dale Bumpers will most likely be remembered for his unsurpassed oratory skills. One thing that made our friend from Arkansas such an effective speaker was that his positions were always based on common sense. Whether or not you agreed with Dale Bumpers, you could always understand the logic behind his argument. But what set him apart was his passion. Not many people can get excited over a 120 year-old mining law, but Dale Bumpers could speak on this issue and convince you that this was the defining issue of the decade. 
I only regret that he was never elected Majority Leader so that he may one day come back to speak as a part of the Leaders' Speaker Series. Maybe we can come up with a waiver provision to let certain colleagues who were never Majority Leader speak--and call it the `Bumpers Rule.' 
For Dale Bumpers the final judgement on the merit of his arguments will not be rendered by the yeas and nays of his colleagues. It will rather be rendered by the illuminating perspective of time. And I have little doubt that time will rule in favor of the Senator from Arkansas. 
Just the other day, Senator Bumpers was on the floor talking about a speech he gave about the ozone layer in the mid 1970s. Most of his statements were considered alarmist at the time, but more than a decade later, an exhaustive study by the National Academy of Sciences confirmed that everything he said has in fact been proven true. And I am confident that time will ultimately prove that Dale Bumpers was right far more often than he was wrong. 
I also think that time will reveal that our friend from Arkansas was one of the most capable, intelligent, and principled legislators that this body has ever known. I can honestly say that it has been an honor to serve alongside Dale Bumpers for the past 18 years. I will truly miss his friendship, and I wish him and his wife Betty only the best in all their future endeavors.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I've been fortunate to be a member of the United States Senate for nearly 18 years, and I have seen a lot of members come and go. But I must admit that I have never seen anyone make a more dramatic exit than our colleague from Ohio. Then again, who in this Chamber would expect anything less? 
John Glenn is a man who has served his nation as a Marine fighter pilot in World War II and Korea, flying a total of 149 combat missions. 
He has served as a test pilot in the first era of supersonic jets--an occupation where attending a colleague's funeral was as common as a new speed record. 
Then of course, John Glenn became a part of our national consciousness when he was chosen to be one of the seven Mercury Astronauts. As much as any event since World War II, his historic flight aboard Friendship 7 on February 20, 1962 united this Nation and made us believe that there are no limits on what we as humans and as Americans can accomplish. 
For the past 24 years, John Glenn has served the people of Ohio and this country as a United States Senator. He has performed his duties with an uncommon grace and dignity. He is a credit to this institution and I am proud to call him a friend. 
And now, on October 29th, in perhaps his last act as a U.S. Senator, John Glenn will return to the heavens aboard the space shuttle Discovery, becoming the oldest man to ever travel in outer space. 
It is very common in this body to feel emotions of deep admiration and respect for one's colleagues, but John Glenn is the rare Senator who inspires feelings of sheer awe. 
I was trying to think of what would be an appropriate way to pay tribute to my friend from Ohio, and to put into perspective how remarkable and inspiring is his impending voyage aboard Discovery. And I was reminded of the famous farewell of another American hero to whom Senator Glenn is linked historically. 
I'm sure all of my colleagues remember Ted Williams--and those of us from New England remember him quite fondly. The Boston Red Sox left-fielder is considered by many to be the greatest hitter who ever lived. The last man to ever hit .400 and the winner of two Triple Crowns, Ted Williams' ability to hit for both power and average has never been matched. 
One fact most people don't know about Ted Williams is that he served in the same squadron with John Glenn during the Korean War. Our friend from Ohio was the squadron commander, and the Mr. Williams was his wing-man. People talk about Ruth and Gehrig as the best one-two punch in history, but John Glenn and Ted Williams isn't half bad. 
As the story is told, when Ted Williams went to Korea, he knew he would be going into combat. Therefore, he was going to pick the best person to fly alongside him. He had been told that John Glenn was one of the best test pilots in the world, so he sought out our colleague in the reception center before shipping out. And while Ted Williams sought out John Glenn, in tapping Ted Williams to be his wing-man, John Glenn was saying that Williams was the best and sharpest pilot he had in his squadron. 
Ted Williams had many great moments on the baseball diamond, but no moment more perfectly encapsulates his career than his last major league at-bat on September 28, 1960. And as John Glenn prepares for his Discovery mission, I cannot help but be reminded of that crisp autumn afternoon at Fenway Park. 
The game was meaningless in the standings, with the Red Sox limping to the end of their worst season in 27 years. But the day was significant for it was the last time that Hub fans would ever get a glimpse of Number Nine's classic swing. After going 0 for 2 with two fly outs and a walk, Ted Williams came to the plate in the bottom of the eighth inning for what was sure to be his last at-bat. Writer John Updike was at the game, and his accounts of that day are considered scripture by baseball fans everywhere. 
As Updike wrote: `Understand that we were a crowd of rational people. We knew that a home run cannot be produced at will; the right pitch must be perfectly met and luck must ride with the ball. Three innings before, we had seen a brave effort fail. The air was soggy, the season was exhausted. Nevertheless, there will always lurk, around the corner in a pocket of our knowledge of the odds, an indefensible hope, and this was one of the times, which you now and then find in sports, when a density of expectation hangs in the air and plucks an event out of the future.' 
As many of my colleagues already know, Ted Williams did not disappoint. In his final swing, he hit a one-one pitch that soared majestically through the air before disappearing into the right-field bullpen. 
As John Updike wrote, `Ted Williams' last word had been so exquisitely chosen, such a perfect fusion of expectation, intention, and execution.' Well, I feel that Senator John Glenn's final word has been just as exquisitely chosen. 
Here is a man whose career of service to this country is unparalleled. Taken separately, his service as a Marine pilot, as an astronaut, and as a Senator are extraordinary. Put together, they are mythic. 
Thirty-six years ago, John Glenn convinced a nation that there are no limits to human potential. At the end of this month, he will once more extend the envelope of human accomplishment. John Glenn's mission on the Discovery is his home run in his last at bat. I only wish that they could find a seat on the Discovery for John Updike. 
Ted Williams' last home run reminds me of John Glenn, not simply because it shows that both men know how to go out in style. It does so because the emotions that were stirred in this fabled at-bat are the very same emotions that have made John Glenn an American hero. 
It is that feeling of indefensible hope, our desire to believe in something that is bigger than ourselves. Simply put, it is our belief in heroes. 
Life will always be full of disappointment and tribulations. But it helps us to conquer the everyday battles in our own lives when we see someone whom we admire accomplish great things. And we cheer for those persons, because in them, we see the best in ourselves. By believing in them, we believe in ourselves. 
When you read John Updike's description of the mood in Fenway Park before that last at bat, it could just as easily be a description of the mood in the Grandstands watching Senator Glenn's launch from Cape Canaveral later this month, or in every American living room when John Glenn boarded Friendship 7 thirty-six years ago. 
Reason insists that we be practical. That we accept our limitations. Yet we hold out hope that we can achieve things once unimaginable, that we can do better. And John Glenn has shown us time and again, as an astronaut, as a test pilot, as a Marine, and as a Senator that we can do better. 
Surprisingly, the fact that John Glenn and Ted Williams served together in Korea remained largely a secret until 10 years ago, when Senator Glenn appeared at a reception to honor Ted Williams on his 70th birthday. At the end of the evening, Ted Williams, a man not known for lavishing praise on others, spoke about his former commander. He said, and I quote: `I was so happy and proud of the fact that I knew him. John Glenn is an extraordinarily talented, brave hero. He's a hell of a man. It's just too bad that he's a Democrat.' 
When Ted Williams is singing your praises, you must be doing something right, and aside from his comments about Senator Glenn's politics, I couldn't agree more with Mr. Williams' statement. 
What we seem to forget about Senator Glenn's departure is that, while he is going into space at the end of the month, he is also coming back. I understand that he plans to set up an institute at Ohio State to encourage young people to become involved in politics and public service. In today's climate, it may be harder to turn young people on to politics than it was to put a man into orbit in 1962. But as a public servant, I cannot imagine a better advocate for the profession of public service than John Glenn. He reminds all of us, young and old, that there is honor in service to others and to your country. 
While I am certain that he will keep busy, I hope that he and Annie will have a chance to relax and enjoy his retirement. They have certainly earned it. 
So as I bid my friend farewell and good luck in his future years, and in particular his mission, I will repeat those words made famous by Scott Carpenter 37 years ago: `Godspeed, John Glenn.'

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Keeping the Internet Decent and Safe (K.I.D.S.) Act. This legislation would give parents and educators tools to protect our children while they use the Internet. Moreover, this bill would give law enforcement officials the ability to make the Internet a safer environment for everyone. 
Unfortunately, while innocently `surfing' the web, many of our children are accidentally encountering graphic and sexually explicit images. They type in search terms as innocuous as `toys'--only to find inappropriate images on their display terminal. According to Wired magazine, there are currently some 28,000 web sites containing hard- and soft-core pornography on the Internet. And that number is growing at an alarming rate. It is estimated that more than 30 pornographic sites are added to the Internet each day. 
In addition, the Internet now provides the `strangers' we have always warned our children about with almost unlimited access to our children. Historically, sexual predators have sought children wherever they gather--in school yards, playgrounds and malls. Today, children hang out in cyberspace. This provides the sexual predator with an almost limitless number of opportunities to exploit children because they can prowl from family room to classroom to bedroom with virtual anonymity. Clearly, this is a problem that is only going to grow worse unless we work aggressively to ensure that the Internet is a safe environment. 
The bill I am introducing today would build upon provisions authored by Senator Coats and myself which were adopted as part of S. 442, the Internet Tax Freedom Act. The provisions are designed to provide some safety for young people who are being exposed today to the alarming amount of pornography on the Internet. Specifically, my amendment will require that Internet access providers make screening software available--either for a fee or no charge--to customers purchasing Internet access services, and Senator Coats' amendment establishes specific measures that commercial operators of sexually explicit sites must take to restrict access to children under the age of 17. 
I am pleased that these provisions of the Internet Tax Freedom Act were passed yesterday and today by both houses of Congress as part of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999, and look forward to the President signing them into law. Yet, it is clear that our work is not done. 
I was very disturbed by a recent article in the The Washington Post which stated that law enforcement officials in the United States and abroad had uncovered an international child pornography ring in which hundreds of people were using the Internet to trade thousands of sexually explicit images of children. More than 200 ring members were arrested in the United States and 13 other countries. The U.S. Customs Service seized computers from American suspects in 22 states, including Connecticut. 
That is why today I introduce the Keeping the Internet Decent and Safe (K.I.D.S.) Act. In this age of the Internet, our children have unprecedented access to educational materials via the computer. However, this wonderful technology has also brought with it a dark side for our children, and we as a nation have an obligation to ensure that our children are able to learn, grow, and play in an environment free from harm. My bill would give parents, teachers and law enforcement officers the tools they need to help protect and guide our children, as they seek knowledge and wholesome entertainment on the Internet. 
First, my bill would make it possible for law enforcement officials to detain someone before trial who is arrested for a federal crime involving child exploitation. Currently, there is a rebuttable presumption that an individual charged with a violent crime or certain drug-related crimes should be detained. Pedophiles who exploit and prey upon children are at least as great a threat to our society as drug dealers and people involved with violent crimes, and federal law enforcement officials should be able to detain them, as well. 
Second, my bill would allow schools to make classroom computers safer by allowing them to use monies from such programs as Title VI and the Safe and Drug Free School Act to purchase screening software. 
Finally, my bill would allow materials involved with crimes involving the sexual victimization of children--such as computers, vehicles and clothing--to be permanently seized from sexual predators by law enforcement authorities. Currently, the government can seize such materials like if they belong to a convicted pornographer, but not if they belong from a convicted child molester. Property used in crimes involving the sexual exploitation of children is equally harmful and should also be able to be seized by the Government to help thwart further criminal activity involving our children. 
As we head into the 21st century, we know that an increasing number--in fact a majority--of our children are going to use the Internet for both educational and social activities. This is a positive development that we should encourage. But with this progress comes new responsibilities, not only for our young people, but also for adults. We owe it to our children to make sure that they are safe when they go on-line.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier this year, this body mourned the passing of a former colleague and a political pioneer: Terry Sanford of North Carolina. Terry Sanford served honorably in the Senate from 1987 to 1993, but he is primarily remembered as the progressive Governor who guided the state of North Carolina from the days of segregation into the modern era of economic prosperity and racial tolerance. 
Elected in 1960, four years before the Civil Rights Act, Terry Sanford aggressively pursued an agenda of racial equality, creating a biracial panel to work on solutions to end job discrimination against blacks. But as crucial as desegregation was to North Carolina's future, Terry Sanford realized that it would have a limited impact without investments in education. 
As much as any figure in modern American politics, Terry Sanford recognized that education was the key to opportunity and economic growth in this country. He established North Carolina's community college system, invested heavily in the public schools, founded the North Carolina School for the Arts, and set up a school for the state's gifted students. He also promoted the use of the research facilities at the state's universities as the foundation of Research Triangle Park, which has become one of the nation's leading hubs of high-tech economic activity. 
After leaving the Governor's office, he went on to serve as the President of Duke University for 16 years, and he led this university to national prominence. 
Many people have expressed their admiration for Terry Sanford in this chamber and in publications across the country, and, in my opinion, one of the most eloquent pieces honoring this Southern statesman actually appeared in a newspaper in Connecticut. Keith C. Burris of The Journal-Inquirer did an excellent job of capturing the essence of this great man who forever changed the face of his state and our nation. His piece reminded me how fortunate I was to serve with Terry Sanford and to call him a friend.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend and a great humanitarian--Pierce Gerety, Jr., whose life was tragically cut short last month when Swissair Flight 111 crashed off the coast of Nova Scotia. Pierce Gerety, Jr. was a remarkable man, and he will be dearly missed. 
Pierce Gerety dedicated his entire life to humanitarian causes. The nephew of two priests, Pierce once aspired to enter the priesthood himself. After graduating from Yale, he went to Paris to study theology and philosophy at the Institute Catholique, where he found time to set up a soup kitchen. However, he soon changed his mind about becoming a priest when he met his future wife Marie de la Soudiere. 
After he was married, he and Marie went to India to work for Catholic Relief Services. He returned to the United States in 1968, and became a social-service case worker in New York City. He then attended Harvard Law School and after graduating in 1971, he worked as a legal aid and civil rights attorney. In 1980, he began his career in refugee work in Thailand with the International Rescue Committee, and, in 1982, he went to work at the United Nations. He became a legal officer at the headquarters of the U.N. High Commissioner in Geneva, and he eventually became a deputy director to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, but he always longed to be in the field working with those who needed help. 
He took on a number of difficult assignments, helping refugees in crisis situations in the Philippines, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. In fact, his colleagues have said that Pierce Gerety put himself in more dangerous situations than any other person in the refugee field. When a warlord in Somalia kidnapped some humanitarian aid workers, Pierce Gerety went into that warlord's armed camp and negotiated their release. Last year, he and other officials pled with the Congolese rebel leader Laurent Kabila to end the slaughter of Rwandan refugees. 
It is ironic that this man, who repeatedly placed himself in harm's way to protect refugees around the globe, would lose his life in such a senseless accident. 
Pierce Gerety, Jr. brought an uncommon intelligence, courage, and devotion to his work. He has touched the lives of countless individuals in a positive way. And his impact is not only felt by refugees around the globe, it is felt by his many peers and friends whom he inspired to do more in their own lives to help persons in need. 
He is survived by his wife Marie and his three children Sebastian, Pierce, and Maeve. He is also survived by his mother Helen, and his three brothers Tom, Peter, and Miles. I offer my heartfelt sympathies to them all.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, two weeks ago, a number of my colleagues and many members of the Washington community gathered at the National Guard Museum for a memorial tribute to a highly respected and admired figure in modern American political life: Kirk O'Donnell. As most of my colleagues know, Kirk O'Donnell was the chief counsel to former Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. and Boston Mayor Kevin White, and he also served as an advisor to Mayors, Congressmen, Senators, and even Presidents. Tragically, Kirk O'Donnell recently died at the age of 52. 
As a fellow Democrat, New Englander, and Irish-American, I had many occasions to cross paths with Kirk O'Donnell, and we eventually became friends. And I have met few people in my political career who were as capable and well-liked as Kirk. 
Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal remembered Kirk as `one of the ablest and most honorable people in American politics.' Tom Oliphant of the Boston Globe said, `he was arguably the best mayor Boston never had. . . Kirk O'Donnell's life demonstrates that all of us can make a difference and that each of us should try.' 
In an era of growing cynicism toward politics, he made people feel optimistic that government could have a positive impact on people's lives. It is always difficult to lose someone who is clearly so special, but it is made all the more difficult by the fact that Kirk was so young and had so much more to offer. 
The afterword from the O'Donnell funeral program was Ralph Waldo Emerson's definition of what constitutes a successful life: 
 ` . . . to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to leave the world a little better place than we found it, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life breathed easier because you have lived. . . . This is to have succeeded.' 
By this measure, Kirk O'Donnell led a successful life. He was a remarkable man, and I will truly miss his friendship. 
Kirk O'Donnell is survived by his wife Kathryn and his two children, Holly and Brendan. I offer my heartfelt sympathies to them all.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the crews of the United States Navy destroyers of Destroyer Squadron 61 who participated in the July 22, 1945 surface naval engagement in Tokyo Bay. That night, the squadron detached from Admiral Halsey's Task Group 38.1, avoided a typhoon, and steamed towards the Japanese mainland. The alert sailors of the squadron identified radar contacts that turned out to be a four-ship Japanese convoy. The squadron commander maneuvered his destroyers on various courses and attacked the convoy with gunfire and torpedoes. At the conclusion of the daring surface engagement, two enemy ships had been sunk, one probably sunk, and one damaged. United States forces suffered neither damage nor casualties. The nine destroyers of the squadron were: U.S.S. DeHaven, U.S.S. Mansfield, U.S.S. Swenson, U.S.S. Collett, U.S.S. Maddox, U.S.S. Blue, U.S.S. Brush, U.S.S. Taussig, and U.S.S. Moore. The sailors who manned those destroyers during this unprecedented operation are deserving of this nation's deepest gratitude, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in this small act of recognition.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, communities are not defined by physical borders. They are defined by people--people who are concerned for the well-being of their neighbors, even if they do not know them. People who want to make their town a good place to raise children. People who recognize the importance of being a part of something larger than themselves. Today, I want to speak about one such person who has worked tirelessly to make Rocky Hill, Connecticut a true community: Robert Deasy. 
Bob Deasy worked for more than forty years as an accountant with Travelers and Phoenix Fire Insurance before retiring more than twenty years ago. Throughout his life, Bob has been remarkably active in the Rocky Hill community. 
From 1973 to 1985, he served as Rocky Hill's registrar of voters, where he worked closely with the Secretary of State's office. He has also been a member of American Legion Post 123 in Rocky Hill for more than 30 years, and he served for eight years as the Post's commander. Through the American Legion, he reached out to young people in the area by coordinating their Boys State and Girls State activities, which provide young people with an opportunity to see how their government works. He also organized Rocky Hill's Memorial Day parade on many occasions, which earned him a citation from the city for exemplary service. 
In 1990, he was recognized for his outstanding service to the community by the Wethersfield/Rocky Hill Elk's Club when they named him their `Citizen of the Year.' 
Bob also sat on the finance council at St. James Church for ten years, where he helped to strengthen this important house of worship. 
But even greater than his commitment to his church and his community is his devotion to his family. Bob has been a devoted husband to his wife Mildred and together they have raised three children, and they enjoy the company of five grandchildren. 
Bob also possesses a passion for politics. He has been active in local Democratic politics for years, and I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with him and to become his friend. I am particularly thankful to Bob for encouraging his granddaughter Adria to become involved in public service. For the past four years she has worked in my Washington office. It has been a pleasure working with her, and she has only enhanced my already high opinion of the Deasy family. 
This Friday, the Rocky Hill Democratic Town Committee will bestow upon Bob their Chairman's Award in gratitude for their work for the party. This award is well deserved, and I congratulate Bob on this honor. 
But, as I stated earlier, Bob Deasy's devotion was not to a political party, it was to a community. And thanks to Bob and people like him, Rocky Hill, Connecticut remains a tightly knit community with its own identity. It is a place with a strong sense of history that people are proud to call home. I thank Bob for all that he has done for the people of Connecticut, and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, communities are not defined by physical borders. They are defined by people. People who are concerned for the well-being of their neighbors, even if they do not know them. People who want to make their town a good place to raise children. People who recognize the importance of being a part something larger than themselves. Today, I want to speak about one such person who has worked tirelessly to make Rocky Hill, Connecticut a true community: Grace M. Amodeo. 
Born in Italy, Grace Amodeo has lived in Rocky Hill for 44 years. Grace is a political pioneer in this town. In 1971, she ran for Mayor of Rocky Hill and earned the nomination of the Democratic party, the first woman to ever do so. Although she didn't win, she did not let that set-back deter her from actively serving her community throughout her life. 
Grace Amodeo was a member of the Board of Education for eight years, and she served as the secretary for four years. A woman of strong faith, she was a Eucharistic Minister at St. James Church. And Rocky Hill has known no stronger advocate on behalf of seniors. Grace was a long-time member of Rocky Hill Seniors and served as their President from 1978 to 1980. She also served on the fundraising committee for the Senior Center. In fact, she was named Rocky Hill's `Senior of the Year' in 1983. 
Grace's contributions to the community are all the more remarkable when you consider that she and her late husband Tony also raised eight children. 
In addition to possessing a commitment to her community, she had a passion for politics, as evidenced by her run for mayor. Grace has been active in local Democratic politics for years, and I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with her. This Friday, the Rocky Hill Democratic Town Committee will bestow upon Grace their Chairman's Award in gratitude for her work for the party. This award is well deserved, and I congratulate Grace on this honor. 
But, as I stated earlier, Grace Amodeo's devotion was not to a political party, it was to a community. And thanks to Grace and people like her, Rocky Hill, Connecticut remains a tightly knit community with its own identity. It is a place with a strong sense of history that people are proud to call home. I thank Grace for all that she has done for the people of Connecticut, and I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today to offer my strong support for Senate passage of the conference report on S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. This important bill will help to close a loophole that allows for the continuation of frivolous and abusive securities class action lawsuits, while ensuring that investors will still be able to bring suits when defendants have acted recklessly. 
In 1995, the Congress enacted legislation, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that was designed to curb the many abuses that had cropped up in that system over the years. Ironically, it was the very success of the 1995 act in shutting down avenues of abuse on the Federal level that created a new home for that abusive and frivolous litigation in state courts. 
Prior to the enactment of the 1995 Reform Act, it was extremely unusual for a securities fraud class action suit to be brought in a state court. But by the end of 1996, it became clear from both the number of cases filed in state court and the nature of those claims, that a significant shift was underfoot as some lawyers sought to evade those provisions of the Reform Act that made it much more difficult to coerce a settlement. 
John Olson, the noted securities law expert, testified in February before the Subcommittee on Securities that: 
In the years 1992 through 1994, only six issuers of publicly traded securities were sued for fraud in state class actions. In contrast, at least seventy-seven publicly traded issuers were sued in state court class actions between January 1, 1996 and June 30, 1997. Indeed, the increase in state court filings may be even greater than indicated by these dramatic statistics. Obtaining an accurate count of state court class actions is extraordinarily difficult, because there is no central repository of such data and plaintiffs are under no obligation to provide notice of the filing of such suits. 
In April, 1997, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff report to Congress and the President found that: 
Many of the state cases are filed parallel to a federal court case in an apparent attempt to avoid some of the procedures imposed by the reform act, particularly the stay of discovery pending a motion to dismiss. This may be the most significant development in securities litigation post-reform act. 
Even though the number of state class actions filed in 1997 was down from the high of 1996 it was still 50 percent higher than the average number filed in the 5 years prior to the Reform Act and it represented a significant jump in the number of parallel cases filed. 1998 looks to maintain those historically high levels. 
This change in the number and nature of cases filed in State court has had two measurable, negative impacts. First, for those companies hit with potentially frivolous or abusive state court class actions, all of the cost and expense that the 1995 Reform Act sought to prevent are once again incurred. 
Some might question whether a state class action can carry with it the same type of incentives that existed on the Federal level prior to 1995 to settle even frivolous suits. In fact, they can and let me provide just one example of how this is so. 
Adobe Systems, Inc., wrote to the Senate Banking Committee on April 23, 1998, about its experience with state class action lawsuits. As many of my colleagues know, one of the key components of the 1995 Reform Act was to allow judges to rule on a motion to dismiss prior to the commencement of the discovery process. Under the old system, Adobe had won a motion for summary dismissal but only after months of discovery by the plaintiff that cost the company more than $2.3 million in legal expenses and untold time and energy by company officials to produce tens of thousands of documents and numerous depositions. With the 1995 act in place, those kinds of expenses are far less likely to occur on the federal level. 
But in an ongoing securities class action suit filed in California state court after passage of the 1995 act, Adobe has had to spend more than $1 million in legal expenses and has had to produce more than 44,000 pages of documents, all before the State judge is even able to entertain a motion for summary dismissal. In fact, in that April 23 letter to Banking Committee Chairman D'Amato, Colleen Pouliot, Adobe's general counsel, noted that `There are a number of California judicial decisions which permit a plaintiff to obtain discovery for the very purpose of amending a complaint to cure its legal insufficiencies.' 
This one example makes clear that while Adobe, which has the resources for a costly and lengthy legal battle, might fight a meritless suit, these litigation costs provide a powerful incentive for most companies to settle these suits rather than incur such expenses. 
The second clear impact of the migration of class action suits to state court is that it has caused companies to avoid using the safe harbor for forward looking statements that was a critical component of the 1995 Reform Act. 
In this increasingly competitive market, investors are demanding more and more information from company officials about where it thinkgs that the company is heading. 
The California Public Employees Pension System, one of the biggest institutional investors, in the nation stated that `forward-looking statements provide extremely valuable and relevant information to investors.' SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt also noted in 1995, the importance of such information in the marketplace:  
Our capital markets are built on the foundation of full and fair disclosure. . . . The more investors know and understand management's future plans and views, the sounder the valuation is of the company's securities and the more efficient the capital allocation process. 
In recent years, the Securities and Exchange Commission, in recognition of this fact, sought to find ways to encourage companies to put such forward-looking into the marketplace. Congress, too, sought to encourage this and this effort ultimately culminated in the creation of a statutory safe harbor, so that companies need not fear a lawsuit if they did not meet their good-faith projections about future performance. 
Unfortunately, the simple fact is that the fear of state court litigation is preventing companies from effectively using the safe harbor. 
Again, the SEC's April 1997 study found that `companies have been reluctant to provide significantly more forward looking disclosure than they had prior to enactment of the safe harbor.' The report went on to cite the fear of state court litigation as one of the principal reasons for this failure. 
Stanford Law School lecturer Michael Perino stated the case very well in a recent law review article: 
If one or more states do not have similar safe harbors, then issuers face potential state court lawsuits and liability for actions that do not violate federal standards. . . . for disclosures that are . . . released to market participants nationwide, the state with the most plaintiff-favorable rules for forward looking disclosures, rather than the federal government, is likely to set the standard to which corporations will conform. 
If the migration of cases to state court were just a temporary phenomenon, then perhaps it would be appropriate for Congress to tell these companies and their millions of investors to simply grin and bear it, that it will all be over soon. But the SEC report contains the warning that this is no temporary trend: `if state law provides advantages to plaintiffs in a particular case, it is reasonable to expect that plaintiffs' counsel will file suit in state court.' 
The plain English translation of that is that any plaintiffs' lawyer worth his salt is going to file in state court if he feels it advantageous for his case; since most state courts do not provide the stay of discovery or a safe harbor, we're confronted with a likelihood of continued state court class actions. 
While the frustration of the objectives of the 1995 Reform Act provide compelling reasons for congressional action, it is equally important to consider whether the proposition of creating a national standard of liability for nationally-traded securities makes sense in its own right. 
I certainly believe it does. 
In 1996, Congress passed the National Securities Markets Improvement Act which established a precedent of national treatment for securities that are nationally traded. In that act, Congress clearly and explicitly recognized that our securities markets were national in scope and that requiring that the securities that trade on those national markets comply with 52 separate jurisdictional requirements afforded little extra protection to investors and while imposing unnecessarily steep costs on raising capital. 
Last July, then-SEC Commissioner Steven Wallman submitted testimony to the Securities Subcommittee in which he said: 
. . . disparate, and shifting, state litigation procedures may expose issuers to the potential for significant liability that cannot be easily evaluated in advance, or assessed when a statement is made. At a time when we are increasingly experiencing and encouraging national and international securities offerings and listing, and expending great effort to rationalize and streamline our securities markets, this fragmentation of investor remedies potentially imposes costs that outweigh the benefits. Rather than permit or foster fragmentation of our national system of securities litigation, we should give due consideration to the benefits flowing to investors from a uniform national approach. 
At the same hearing, Keith Paul Bishop, then-California's top state securities regulator testified that: 
California believes in the federal system and the primary role of the states within that system. However, California does not believe that federal standards are improper when dealing with truly national markets. California businesses, their stockholders and their employees are all hurt by inordinate burdens on national markets. Our businesses must compete in a world market and they will be disadvantaged if they must continue to contend with 51 or more litigation standards.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, is intended to create a uniform national standard for securities fraud class actions involving nationally-traded securities. In advocating enactment of uniform national standards for such actions, I firmly believe that the national standards must be fair ones that adequately protect investors. I hope that Senator D'Amato, one of the architects of the Banking Committee's substitute, would engage in a colloquy with me on this point.

Mr. DODD. At a hearing on S. 1260 last October, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voiced concern over some recent federal district court decisions on the state of mind--or scienter--requirement for pleading fraud that was adopted in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ('95 Reform Act or PSLRA). According to the SEC, some federal district courts have concluded that the 1995 Reform Act adopted a pleading standard that was more rigorous than the second circuit's, which, at the time of enactment of the PSLRA, had the toughest pleading standards in the nation. Some of these courts have also suggested that the '95 Reform Act changed not only the pleading standard but also the standard for proving the scienter requirement. At the time we enacted the PSLRA, every federal court of appeals in the nation--ten in number--concluded that the scienter requirement could be met by proof of recklessness.

Mr. DODD. I agree with the comments of my colleague from New York. I, too, did not intend for the PSLRA to alter the state of mind requirement in securities fraud lawsuits or to adopt a pleading standard more stringent than that of the second circuit. In fact, I specifically stated during the legislative debates preceding and following the President's veto that the 1995 Reform Act adopted the second circuit's pleading standard. This continues to be my understanding and intent today. Ensuring that the scienter standard includes reckless misconduct is critical to investor protection. Creating a higher scienter standard would lessen the incentives for issuers of securities to conduct a full inquiry into potentially troublesome areas and could therefore damage the disclosure process that has made our markets a model for other nations. The U.S. securities markets are the envy of the world precisely because investors at home and abroad have enormous confidence in the way our markets operate. Altering the scienter standard in the way envisioned by some of these district court decisions could be very damaging to that confidence.

Mr. DODD. It appears that these district courts have misread the language of the 1995 Reform Act's `Statement of Managers.' As I made clear in the legislative debate following the President's veto, however, the disputed language in the Statement of Managers was simply meant to explain that the conference committee omitted the Specter amendment because that amendment did not adequately reflect existing second circuit caselaw on the pleading standard. I can only hope that when the issue reaches the federal courts of appeals, these courts will undertake a more thorough review of the legislative history and correct these decisions. While I trust that the courts will ultimately honor Congress' clear intent, should the Supreme Court eventually find that recklessness no longer suffices to meet the scienter standard, it is my intent to introduce legislation that would explicitly restore recklessness as the pleading and liability standard for federal securities fraud lawsuits. I imagine that I would not be alone in this endeavor, and I ask my good friend from New York whether he would join me in introducing such legislation?

Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from New York, the chairman of the Banking Committee, for his leadership on this bill and for engaging in this colloquy with me. In proceeding to create uniform national standards while some issues concerning the 1995 Reform Act are still being decided by the courts, we must act based on what we intended and understand the 1995 Reform Act to mean. As a sponsor of both the Senate bill that became the 1995 Reform Act and the bill, S. 1260, that we are debating today, I am glad that we have had this opportunity to clarify how the PSLRA's pleading standards will function as the uniform national standards to be created in S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the tragedy that continues to unfold in the Province of Kosovo. I cannot stress to my colleagues enough how serious I believe the Kosovo situation has become. What we are witnessing in Kosovo now is potentially the most dangerous conflict in the Balkans since 1991. For more than seven months, President Milosevic and his Serb police forces have been engaged in an offensive against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo that can only be characterized as `ethnic cleansing'. 
The Congress must put aside election year politics and speak with one voice in support of the United States utilizing all necessary means to put an end to these atrocities that threaten a wider war in the Balkans. For that reason, I hope that the Republican leadership will allow a vote in the Senate to signal our strong support for the use of air power against Serbian targets in the coming days. 
Clearly no one on the other side of the aisle can assert that the new escalation of fighting in Kosovo has not been very destabilizing to the region. The evidence clearly indicates that it has--over a quarter of a million of Kosovans have been displaced, many of whom have fled beyond the borders of Kosovo and Serbia to Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
Similarly the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) has sought refuge and material support from Albanian populations in other countries--such actions could draw others into an ever widening civil conflict. 
But it is not only the conflict's disastrous potential that cries out for action. The status quo in Kosovo is a human catastrophe. According to some estimates, already more than 1,000 people have been killed since the end of February, when Serbian paramilitary police began their crackdown on villages in Kosovo believed to be strongholds of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Many more have been driven from their homes. 
Fearful women and children are hiding from the Serb police and other Serb armed forces in the hills around Kosovo without adequate food, water, or shelter. Nightly temperatures are already falling near freezing at night and it is clear that with the advent of winter their fate is doomed. Mr. President, we cannot let this humanitarian and human rights catastrophe continue. 
The deep concern about the current crisis is a shared one--it is bipartisan. Many of the members of this body have recently had an opportunity to hear from a former colleague and Majority Leader Senator Bob Dole who at the behest of President Clinton traveled to Kosovo and Belgrade to make a first hand assessment of the situation. He was accompanied on that visit by Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, John Shattuck. 
Senator Dole and Assistant Secretary Shattuck returned to Washington with a shared assessment of what has been transpiring in Kosovo in recent weeks. 
They have both spoken of atrocities being perpetrated against the civilian population--ninety percent of whom are ethnic Albanians. Senator Dole again confirmed what many of us in this body have been saying over the last seven months, namely that `Milosevic is again on the warpath. . . . and, there should be no doubt that Serbia is engaged in major, systematic attacks on the people and territory of Kosovo.' 
The United States has been assertive in condemning Serbian aggression. The Clinton administration has spoken out repeatedly against Serb human rights abuses in Kosovo, and has stated that it will not let Serbs follow through with their ethnic cleansing. The Congress too has felt it extremely important to go on record to denounce Yugoslav President Milosevic and the Serbian military and security forces under his direction. We in the Senate also called upon the international community to act forcefully if Serbian armed aggression continued. Sadly Serbian aggression has continued. Innocent Kosovans have lost mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, aunts and uncles. 
There is a time for words and a time for force. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke has been trying as I speak to convince Milosevic to alter course. The latest information indicates that these efforts are unlikely to produce positive results. To my mind, that means that the time for words is over. Our entreaties to Milosevic to do the right thing have fallen on deaf ears. Milosevic and his Serbian forces have been mocking the international community by declaring one thing and doing another. 
The time has come for the international community to confront the obvious contradictions between the words and deeds of Milosevic and the Serbian security forces under his command--saying on the one hand that a unilateral cease fire has been established and continuing on the other hand with his attacks on ethnic Albanian villages. The Serbian September 26, cease-fire declaration was pure theater. Frankly so was last weekend's `withdrawal' of Serbian forces. At the very moment that Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic publicly declared that the seven-month offensive against the militant separatists was over, fighting continued in southern Kosovo. 
Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past and give Milosevic another chance to mislead the international community. Russian objections to the use of force by NATO should carry no weight at this juncture. NATO has given Milosevic its final ultimatum--to comply immediately with all UN and NATO demands to end the crackdown in Kosovo, withdraw government forces and open meaningful political negotiations with the ethnic Albanians. 
NATO's military options both to stop fighting and to enforce a possible peace settlement have been planned in detail over the past months. NATO's military staff is prepared to act. All that is needed is the political will upon the part of NATO governments to give the green light. We can no longer afford to show any more patience for the indecision of our Allies. In my view the internationally community has already waited too long to put an end to the human suffering that is being inflicted on innocent men, women and children. After seven years of watching Milosevic play cat and mouse games with United States and European leaders, I believe that the only language this individual will respond to is the sound of missiles hitting and crushing strategic targets in his proverbial backyard. 
Mr. President, yesterday NATO Foreign Ministers met in Brussels. In reporting on the outcome of that meeting, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright reported that NATO was united and ready to authorize bombing in Serbia. Earlier this week, President Clinton assured members of the Senate that any air strikes conducted by NATO against Serbia would not be `pinprick" strikes but would `send a very clear signal' that we mean business. 
We in the United States need to lead by example. We cannot wait any longer--for humanitarian reasons, for human rights reasons, and for geo-political reasons. If the international community fails to respond to Milosevic's continued assaults on Kosovo with force if necessary, then shortly there will be few if any ethnic Albanians left to protect in Kosovo and stability in the greater Balkans will be at risk. 
Mr. President, I know that many of my colleagues share my views. I believe the American people as well.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to support H.R. 2431--the International Religious Persecution Act of 1998--as amended by the substitute offered by Senator Nickles and others. I believe that the changes that this amendment makes to the underlying bill vastly improve the effectiveness of this legislation in promoting religious freedom around the world and in better responding to actions that would deny people such freedom, regardless of where they reside. 
Mr. President, we in the United States are very fortunate. Our Founding Fathers recognized the importance of religious freedom as a bedrock issue. That they did so is not surprising. It was borne out of their personal experiences having been forced to flee their countries because of religious intolerance and outright persecution. For that reason, religious freedom was given a prominent place by the drafters of the Constitution--in the Bill of Rights as the first amendment to the Constitution. 
We as Americans are not the only ones who cherish and hold dear our religious freedom. This important and unalienable right is also a part of the universal collection of rights that people around the globe hold sacred. It is recognized in both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights. 
Despite the seeming universality of the right to religious freedom, people throughout the planet are every day being denied the right to practice their religion--Christian and Jew, Moslem and Buddhist, Hindu and Baha'i. At its most extreme, unthinkable acts have been perpetrated against an entire people in the process of denying them the right to practice their faith, I am speaking of the annihilation of more than 6 million Jews by Adolf Hitler while the world looked on. 
Even today, religious intolerance remains rooted in too many societies throughout the planet--in Iran, in Sudan, in Burma, in the People's Republic of China, in Russia--and this is by no means an exhaustive list. 
H.R. 2431, as amended, seeks to establish a policy and procedures for the United States government to follow in defending religious freedom internationally. It provides for the imposition of targeted sanctions against governments which practice religious persecution. However, it also gives the President and the Secretary of State some measure of flexibility in carrying out the policy. 
I am also pleased to note that it excludes the denial of food and medicine as a sanctions option under this legislation. I have never believed that to deny innocent men, women and children access to the very basic necessities of life places the United States as a government on a particularly high moral ground at the very time we are trying to elicit a higher standard of moral behavior by other governments. The bill also includes waiver authority that will enable the President to react with flexibility to changing events in furtherance of U.S. national interests. Finally, the bill includes a sunset provision that would lift any sanctions imposed pursuant to this act after two years, unless specifically reauthorized by the Congress. 
I believe that President Clinton is committed to promoting international religious freedom. In no way should the passage of this legislation be interpreted as a criticism of the administration's efforts to champion the cause of international religious freedom. Rather, my support for this legislation should be viewed as an effort to complement the Administration's efforts. Passage of the pending legislation will signal to the world that the Congress stands fully behind all efforts to promote religious freedom along with other fundamental human rights as a core component in the United States foreign policy agenda. 
I commend Senator Nickles and my colleague from Connecticut Senator Lieberman for all their work on this legislation. Thanks to their efforts to perfect and refine its provisions, this legislation will be far more effective in furthering U.S. efforts to promote respect for religious freedom throughout the world. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join with them and many others in this Chamber in voting for final passage of this bill at the appropriate time.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment that a provision in the fiscal year 1999 Treasury, Postal Appropriations Bill relating to contraceptive coverage under the Federal Employee Health Benefits program was dropped in conference. 
This provision, authored by Senators Harry Reid and Olympia Snowe, would have required the Federal Employee Health Benefits plans that cover prescription drugs to treat contraceptives in the same fashion as all other covered drugs. This amendment passed the Senate unanimously. A similar provision, offered by Representative Nita Lowey, was approved by the House by a vote of 224-198. However, even after the strong, bipartisan show of support by both bodies, this provision was still dropped in conference. 
I was a cosponsor of the bipartisan legislation on which this provision was based. Along with a bipartisan group of 25 of my colleagues, I wrote the conferees on this bill asking them to retain this provision in the conference report. 
I'd like to think we've come a long way since the early 1960s when birth control was illegal in many states. So it was astonishing to me to learn that in this day and age, many families find their contraceptive choices to be limited by their insurers--because insurers are not required to cover prescriptive contraceptives. 
In Connecticut, for example, 62% of insurers don't cover birth control pills and 85% don't cover devices such as IUDs and diaphragms. At the same time, almost all of these policies cover sterilization. And of the 68,000 pregnancies each year in our state, more than 14,000 are unplanned. 
Under far too many health plans, women are offered the unconscionable `choice' of getting help in paying for an unplanned pregnancy, an abortion, or sterilization--but not for birth control. 
Is this the best choice we can offer to families trying to act responsibly, wanting to bring children into the world when they can be supported and cared for? 
Many of us agree that contraception, and improved access to contraception, is a simple, cost-effective way to lower the staggering rate of unintended pregnancies in the United States. 
I am very disappointed that this provision has been dropped from the fiscal year 1999 Treasury, Postal Appropriations Bill and the federal government lost an opportunity to be a leader on this critical issue.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I just want to inquire. I see the majority leader. 
Before we go to the reading of the bill, I had mentioned to the majority leader earlier that I was going to propound a unanimous consent request on behalf of myself and Senator Reid of Nevada. 
Very briefly--I will just take 30 seconds--this unanimous consent request will be the discharge of the Finance Committee and then to proceed immediately to a piece of legislation I introduced that would propose a moratorium on HMOs terminating any of their patients between now and over the next 4 or 5 months while we are out of session. 
I realize that there will be objection probably filed to this, or expressed on this. 
We have seen 400,000 people in the last number of months who have lost their HMOs--12,000 in my State over the last 3 weeks. When we are out of session, I am concerned that more of these people are going to be dropped. 
So for those reasons, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee, on behalf of myself and Senator Reid, be discharged from consideration of S. 2562 and the Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am delighted to stand here and thank the chairman and the ranking member, the Senator from Massachusetts, as we are about to adopt the Coats Human Services Reauthorization Act, which includes Head Start, LIHEAP and the community services block grants. 
People are going to wonder. This is the second day in a row that I find myself on the floor extolling the tremendous contribution of my colleague from Indiana. 
We were involved in a piece of legislation yesterday. But I think all of us, as I said yesterday, are going to miss our friend, who is going to be here only a few more days and will move on to another chapter in his life. 
But it is highly appropriate, given his tremendous work over his career in the Senate on behalf of children and families that this piece of legislation is going to be named in honor of his service to our country. 
I am very pleased to join in that effort, and to commend him for his spectacular work over the years of service in the Senate. 
Senator Coats and I have worked intensively with Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, other members of our committee, and the House committee to complete this important reauthorization. The strong bipartisan support for this bill is a clear statement of how we all view the crucial programs included in this bill. And it is also a testament to the leadership of Senator Coats on this legislation. While we have not necessarily agreed on every issue, I have always admired Senator Coats dedication to working to help working families, and in particular, to helping children. His presence on the Labor Committee will surely be missed, and I am pleased that the full committee chose to name this important bill after Senator Coats, as a show of respect and admiration for his service in the Senate. 
This bill is fundamentally about expanding opportunity in America for all of our citizens. Under the umbrella of the Human Services Act, low income communities, their families and children receive more than $5 billion of assistance each year. These dollars support the basic building blocks of stronger communities--care and education for young children in Head Start, food, job and economic development through the Community Services Block grant, and home heating assistance through LIHEAP. 
Head Start is the nation's leading child development program, because it focuses on the needs of the whole child. Inherently, we know that a child cannot be successful if he or she has unidentified health needs, if his or her parents are not involved in their education, and if he or she is not well-nourished or well-rested. Head Start is the embodiment of those concerns and works each day to meet children's critical needs. This year, Head Start will serve over 830,000 children and their families this year, and nearly 6,000 in my home state of Connecticut. 
The bill before us today further strengthens the Head Start program: We continue the expansion of the Early Head Start program, increasing the set aside for this program to 10 percent in FY 2002. Anyone who has picked up a magazine or newspaper within the last year knows how vital the first three years of child's life are to their development. This program, which we established in 1994, extends comprehensive, high-quality services to these young children and their parents, to make sure the most is made of this window of opportunity. 
We have added new provisions to encourage collaboration within states and local communities as well as within individual Head Start programs to expand the services they offer to families to full-day and full-year services, where appropriate, and to leverage other child care dollars to improve quality and better meet family needs. 
We emphasize the importance of school readiness and literacy preparation in Head Start. While I think this has always been a critical part of Head Start, this bill ensures that gains will continue to be made in this area. 
Mr. President, this bill puts Head Start on strong footing as we approach the 21st Century. It is a framework within which Head Start can continue to grow to meet the needs of more children and their families. What is unfortunate is that we cannot guarantee more funding for Head Start--I think it is shameful that there are waiting lists for Head Start and that only 40 percent of eligible children are served by this program. And Early Head Start, which is admittedly a new program, serves just a tiny fraction of the infants and toddlers in need of these services. 
The President has set a laudable goal to reach 1 million children by 2002. But I say we need to do more. We need a plan to serve 2 million children--all those eligible and in need of services--as soon as possible. 
Some argue that meeting the goal of fully funding Head Start will be too costly. Yes, it will cost a great deal to get there. But my question is how much more will it cost not to get there? 
Studies show us that children in quality early childhood development programs, such as Head Start, start school more ready to learn than their non-Head Start counterparts. They are more likely to keep up with their classmates, avoid placement in special education, and graduate from high school. They are also less likely to become teenage mothers and fathers, go on welfare, or become involved in violence or the criminal justice system. 
How much does it cost when we don't see these benefits? 
I know this is an issue for another place and another venue. But I am hopeful as we strengthen Head Start we can also strengthen our resolve to expand this successful program to reach more children and their families. 
Mr. President, the bill before us also makes important changes to the Community Services Block Grant program. CSBG makes funds available to states and local communities to assist low-income individuals and help alleviate the causes of poverty. One thousand local service providers--mainly Community Action Agencies--use these federal funds to address the root causes of poverty within their communities. CSBG dollars are particularly powerful because local communities have substantial flexibility in determining where these dollars are best spent to meet their local circumstances. 
I have had the pleasure of visiting Community Action Agencies in Connecticut many times. They are exciting, vibrant places at the very center of their communities--filled with adults taking literacy and job training courses, children at Head Start centers, seniors with housing or other concerns, and youths participating in programs or volunteering their time. 
To see clearly how critical the CSBG program is to the nation's low income families, one only needs to look at the statistics. The CSBG program in 1995 served more than 11.5 million people, or one in three Americans living in poverty. Three-quarters of CSBG clients have incomes that fall below the federal poverty guideline. 
This bill recognizes the fundamental strength of this program and makes modest changes to encourage broader participation by neighborhood groups. In addition, it improves the accountability of local programs. 
This bill also reauthorizes the vitally important Low Income Heating and Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. Nearly 4.2 million low-income households received LIHEAP assistance during FY1996, more than 70,000 households in Connecticut. One quarter of those assisted by LIHEAP funds are elderly. Another 25 percent are individuals with disabilities. I cannot overvalue the importance of this assistance--it is nearly as necessary as food and water to a low-income senior citizen or family with children seeking help to stay warm in the winter--or as we saw a few months ago in the Southwest--to stay cool during the summer. 
This bill makes no fundamental changes to the LIHEAP program. I am very pleased we increase the authorization of the program to $2 billion, which recognizes the great need for this help. We also put into place a system to more accurately and quickly designate natural disasters. Early disaster designation will allow for the more efficient distribution of the critically important emergency LIHEAP funds, aiding States devastated by a natural disaster. 
This bill contains one new, important program--the Individual Development Accounts, based on a bill offered by Senator Coats and Senator Harkin. Individual Development Accounts, or IDA's, are dedicated savings accounts for very low income families, similar in structure to IRA's, that can be used to pay for post-secondary education, buy a first home, or capitalize a business. This program is a welcome addition to the Human Services Act family. The Assets for Independence title will provide low-income individuals and families with new opportunities to move their families out of poverty through savings. 
This is a strong bill and it is a good bill. I hope my colleagues will support this conference report, and again I want to thank Senator Coats for his committed leadership on this effort. 
For all of those reasons, Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the committee and again the ranking member. Suzanne Day of my office and Jim Fenton did a tremendous job; Stephanie Monroe from Senator Coats' office, Stephanie Robinson from Senator Kennedy's office and Kimberly Barnes O'Connor of Senator Jeffords' office did a tremendous job in pulling this together. We thank all of them for their efforts. 
Again, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his graciousness.

Mr. DODD. I know the Chairman knows that the veterans in VISN 1 live in a region that stretches from Connecticut to Maine. The budget for our region's medical care has dropped from $854 million in fiscal year 1996 to $809 million in fiscal year 1998. I have been informed by the Department of Veterans Affairs that the New England region will endure yet another budget cut in fiscal year 1999. I hope that the Appropriations Committee will take note of the impact these reductions are having on facilities across New England.

Mr. DODD. To say to my colleague from Texas, and others, I didn't have the benefit of hearing my friend's comments from Maryland, but I fervently hope--it has taken almost 20 years for us to come to the point where we are with financial services modernization. And my colleague from Texas has been on that committee for a long time, the distinguished Senator from Maryland even longer and knows the agony we have gone through, Mr. President, over the years of coming close and failing, for a variety of reasons, to be able to put through a modernization bill that would enjoy the kind of support this bill does. 
And here we have the world looking to us. You have news today of the yen now having, compared to the dollar in exchange rates, in the last 48 hours, dropped to a lower rate than it has in 50 years--50 years. We have a problem in Brazil of significant magnitude. 
It is no secret here that the world looks to us for a sense of confidence. And here we are within hours of leaving this session of Congress with a strong bipartisan bill, led by the Senator from Maryland, the Senator from New York, Senator D'Amato, the chairman of the committee, with a 16-2 vote coming out of that committee, and 88-11 on a cloture motion. 
My colleague from Texas feels strongly about the CRA provisions, and I respect that. But I would strongly argue that there is going to be ample time for us, whether today or tomorrow, if we can get it done, but if not certainly the next Congress to deal with the CRA provisions. 
There may not be another opportunity that comes along to deal with this issue, I say to my friend from Texas. As he knows, we have spent so many years trying to put together--here we are on the threshold of doing something truly significant in this Congress, and as strongly as people feel about CRA, we should never allow that issue here to deprive us the opportunity to send a message not only here at home, but abroad that this country, that this Congress can modernize its financial institutions to such a degree that we send that message of confidence at this critical hour, a message of confidence. 
The Democrats and Republicans have been able to come together on an issue that has divided us over the years. So I fervently hope that we will not allow that one issue to outweigh the enormous benefits that this bill offers people at home and abroad when the world financial crisis is literally on our doorstep. 
So I hope that either something gets worked out or that those who are for it would be willing to put aside their feelings on the CRA issue until another day when there will literally be dozens of vehicles when that issue can be addressed. Mr. President, I tell you today, there will not be the dozens of vehicles available to us to do what we on the Banking Committee were able to present to all of our colleagues here for the first time in more than two decades, some would argue more than three decades. So the opportunity is here. I just hope we do not miss this. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise along with my colleague, Senator Jeffords, in introducing a critically important piece of legislation that will ensure fair treatment for individuals and families who provide invaluable care to foster children and adults. 
Presently, foster care providers are permitted to deduct expenditures made while caring for foster individuals if detailed expense records are maintained to support such deductions. However, section 131 of the Internal Revenue Code permits certain foster care providers to exclude, from taxable income, payments they receive to care for foster individuals. Who specifically is available for this exclusion depends upon a complicated analysis of three factors: the age of the individual receiving foster care services, the type of foster care placement agency, and the source of the foster care payments. 
Section 131 presently permits foster care providers to exclude payments from taxable income only when a state, or one of its political divisions, or a charitable tax exempt placement agency places the individual and makes the foster care payments for children under 19 years of age. However, for adults over the age of 19, section 131 permits foster providers to exclude payments from taxable income only when a State, or one of its divisisions, places the individual and provides the foster care payments. 
Mr. President, it is time that we remove the inequities and needless complexities of the current system. States and localities across the country are increasingly relying on private agencies to arrange for foster care services for both children and adults. However, some foster care providers are understandably reluctant to contract with private placement agencies because current law requires such providers to include foster care payments as taxable income. In contrast, current law permits providers who care for foster individuals placed in their homes by government agencies to exclude such payments from taxable income. Current law, therefore, discourages families from providing foster care on behalf of private placement agencies, thereby reducing badly-needed foster care opportunities for individuals requiring assistance. 
The bill Senator Jeffords and I introduce today will greatly simplify the outdated tax rules applicable to foster care payments. Under our legislation, foster care providers would be able to avoid onerous record keeping by excluding from income any foster care payment received regardless of the age of the individual receiving foster care services, the type of agency that placed the individual, or the source of foster care payments. To ensure appropriate oversight, this bill will require the placement agency to be licensed either by, or under contract with, a state or one or its political divisions. 
Mr. President, this legislation accomplishes what current law does not--consistent and fair treatment of families and individuals who open their homes and their hearts to foster children and adults.

Mr. DODD. I commend my colleague from Indiana who is in his closing days in this body, having made the decision not to seek reelection. A lot of Members, as they wind down, spend their last few days winding up work and not being actively involved in the legislative process. It is a tribute to Senator Coats that in his remaining days in this body, he is still very active and involved in issues he has cared deeply about. This is one such issue. I commend him for this amendment. I think it is a very creative way to advance this issue and provide some safety for young people who are being exposed today to an alarming amount of pornography on the Internet. 
I strongly support his amendment. Now, let me put my amendment in a framework for some people. My amendment is a second degree amendment, and really complements the Coats amendment. My amendment requires that Internet access providers either provide free of charge, or for a fee, screening software at the time they make sales to customers. Internet access providers that don't do this, as with the Coats amendment, would be denied the benefits of the tax breaks in the underlying bill. This amendment also relies on the Ginsberg definition that has been used in the Coats amendment. 
How big is this problem, people say? Let me just put it in perspective for you. According to Wired Magazine, there are 28,000 web sites worldwide that have soft- or hard-core pornography on them. And, fifty new web sites with such material are added to the Internet every single day--50 a day. 
My colleague from Indiana has some material he wisely decided not to show on the floor, but suffice to say, most Americans would find it highly offensive, to put it mildly. The idea that this material is available to children is something that ought to be a cause of alarm to all of us. Sadly, many of our children are unwittingly and accidentally exposed to such sites while surfing the web. They type in search terms as innocuous as `toys'--pretty innocuous--only to find graphic images and language on their display terminals. 
Mr. President, the Internet is profoundly changing the way we learn and communicate with people. Today our children have unprecedented access to educational material through the Internet. It provides children with vast opportunities to learn about art and culture and history. The possibilities are endless. It is an incredibly valuable technology for children all across this country and across the globe. 
But as with any technology, Mr. President, this advanced technology also brings with it a dark side for our children. Many of these young people are browsing the net, often unaccompanied by an adult, and come across material that is unsuitable, to put it mildly. It is oftentimes very sexually explicit. 
Every parent worries about strangers approaching their children in their neighborhood or on a playground at school. 
And they teach their children how to avoid these strangers. But today, these strangers can literally enter our homes via the Internet. They are only a mouse click away from our children. In our libraries and bookstores, we store reading material that is harmful to minors in areas accessible only to adults. Yet, in cyberspace, these same materials are as accessible to a child as his or her favorite bedtime story. Pornographic images and sexual predators are now reaching our children, via the Internet, in the privacy and safety of their own homes and classrooms. This kind of access to our children is alarming, and this invasion of our children's privacy and innocence is unconscionable. 
Just a few weeks ago, law enforcement agents in a sting operation apprehended 200 members of an Internet pornography ring that possessed and distributed sexually explicit images of children. Members of this ring traded inappropriate images of children on the Internet. One of the sites raided was in my own State of Connecticut. As I noted a moment ago, there are 50 new sites a day added to the Web that contain pornography, these sites are added to the 28,000 that already exist. Despite this successful operation by law enforcement agents, their raid only represents the elimination of approximately four days of new sites. 
We, as a nation, have an obligation to ensure that surfing the web remains a safe and viable option for our children. We have a responsibility to make sure that they are able to learn and grow in an environment free of sexual predators and pornographic images. Clearly, there is no substitute for parental supervision; yet, I think we can all agree that many parents know less about the Internet than their children do. Parents are convinced of the Internet's educational value, but they also feel anxious about their ability to supervise their children while they use it. In my view, it is important that we encourage parents and children to use the Internet together. But clearly, it is difficult for any adult to monitor children on line all the time. 
Therefore, I believe we need to provide our parents with tools that will help them to protect and to guide their children on the Internet. The amendment I have offered here is a modest measure. It is not a cure-all by any stretch of the imagination. It is a modest idea and just requires that Internet access providers make screening software available to customers purchasing Internet access services. 
The amendment would allow customers to have the opportunity, as I said, to either buy or obtain free of charge, as determined by the provider, screening software that permits customers to limit access to material on the Internet that is harmful to minors. Like going to a pharmacy and being asked if you want to buy a childproof lid for prescription medication, my bill will require that Internet access providers ask parents whether they would like to obtain screening software to protect them from the very kind of dangers that we see on the 28,000 existing web sites and the 50 new ones that are added each day. This is a serious problem, and providing this kind of tool to parents is one way we can begin to combat the problem. 
At any rate, I hope my colleagues will see fit to support this amendment. It has been offered once before on the floor and passed the Senate overwhelmingly and, not unlike the Coats amendment, we need to have it included in this bill today. 
Again, I commend my colleague from Indiana for his fine work on many issues, but once again on this particular issue, and hope as well this second-degree amendment will be adopted.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last week, close to 400,000 older Americans and individuals with disabilities, representing some 300 counties and 18 States across this Nation, were notified by their Medicare health maintenance organizations that as of January 1, 1999, their insurers would be terminating their health coverage. 
In my State of Connecticut, we were notified on Friday around 6 o'clock that 6,000 seniors would see their HMO, Oxford Health Plan, leave their communities. When added to earlier withdrawals from the market by other HMOs in Connecticut, this announcement means that more than 12,000 Connecticut Medicare beneficiaries will lose their present HMO providers. 
One can only imagine the anxiety of seniors reading of the announcement in their newspapers or hearing on television that their HMO would not be there for them on January 1 and having no one to turn to, no one to ask questions of, with offices closed for the weekend. Even the Health Care Financing Administration, which regulates these HMOs, had not yet received the news. 
Only three weeks earlier, two other HMOs in Connecticut notified their customers that they would be backing out of New London, Windham, and Tolland Counties, jeopardizing affordable Medicare coverage for about 6,000 seniors. 
The precipitous withdrawal of managed care organizations from Medicare is a growing problem. Unless action is taken, on January 1, 1999 thousands of seniors will find themselves at forced to leave established relationships with their doctors and without affordable health care coverage. 
I am fearful that with Congress adjourning later this week or early next week, and being out of session for the bulk of October, November, December, it may not be until January that we will again have the opportunity to do something about this. 
I am going to be calling on the leadership today to enact an emergency piece of legislation, which I will be introducing today, to put a moratorium on HMOs leaving the Medicare market while we are not in session. This legislation will give us some time to see if we can't sort out this mess and prevent thousands more seniors from finding themselves without HMO coverage on January 1, 1999, a matter of weeks. 
My hope is that the leadership will find some time to consider this and adopt it before we leave, hopefully on a bipartisan basis, to stop this serious problem we are seeing in my State and 17 other States around the country. 
Mr. President, last Friday I also introduced legislation that deals with the broader issues underlying the recent withdrawals of Medicare HMOs from certain communities. Because it takes a comprehensive approach, I do not expect that this bill would be adopted before we leave. However, I would hope that for now we can at least agree on a narrowly defined moratorium which would at least give us time to find solutions to the larger problem. 
Mr. President, I would like to briefly outline for my colleagues the provisions of the legislation I introduced last week. Specifically, the legislation would not allow a flat termination of coverage if there are other less drastic options available. In the case of the withdrawals of two HMOs in eastern Connecticut, after causing considerable distress to seniors with an announcement that they were leaving, the companies re-evaluated their positions in the face of strong pressure from the community, and said `Well, maybe there are some other options we hadn't considered.' This legislation will require they consider those other options first--before creating anxiety among our seniors. 
Secondly, the legislation will stipulate that if a company maintains there are no other options but ending coverage, they must demonstrate that. In addition, the HMO would then be responsible for notifying consumers of what alternative coverage is available. 
The legislation also requires that HMOs commit to serving seniors for more than just a year. Right now, HMOs are only required to contract on an annual basis. We would require them to make a 3-year commitment. It is important to keep in mind that we are talking about companies that have made the careful determination that it is in their financial interest to enter the Medicare market. These are companies that have extensively recruited seniors and convinced them to leave long-standing relationships with their health care providers to join their HMO and then, with very precipitous announcements, as we have seen in the last several weeks, they have left those communities. 
Mr. President, this is a serious, serious problem that is going to get worse, in my view, if we don't take some steps. We passed similar legislation a number of years ago dealing with plant closings. We finally decided that having a company announce precipitously it is leaving, disrupting communities, disrupting the lives of their employees, is unwise and that we ought to adopt legislation that requires at least some advance notice so that communities and people can try to rearrange their lives. 
I am suggesting parallel legislation to deal with Medicare HMOs. Here it is so important, particularly for our older Americans or disabled Americans, many of them living alone, who don't have the financial resources to hire lawyers and read through all of the morass of paperwork when it comes to finding a new HMO, that they be given adequate notice and provided with clear information about their options. 
We are hopeful we can build some support for the idea of considering all options, having more advanced notice, and extending the contract term. If you are going to go out and try to entice people to sign up, it seems to me you have an obligation to stick with them for a while. Certainly just to make a decision that you are going to pull out of the area, with minimal notice, I think is wrong.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a minute to talk about an individual in my State whom I only met for about 10 minutes, but who had a profound impact on my view of this situation. He is a man by the name of Fred Kral. He is a person who led, in many ways, I suppose, an ordinary life, but I think became sort of an extraordinary figure. He recently died at the age of 72. 
Mr. Kral lived in Niantic, CT, for the last 48 years. He served in World War II. After the war, he attended the Rhode Island School of Design. He later went to the University of Connecticut. He earned a degree in agricultural engineering. 
He worked at Electric Boat Company, a builder of submarines, for 38 years and retired in 1989 as manager of materials for the Kessel Ring site in Ballston Spa, NY. 
He was a member of the Masons. He was also a member of the East Lyme Water and Sewer Commission. An avid golfer and a track letterman back in college, he was a founding and life member of the Niantic Sportsman's Club where he served in various offices. 
Most important, Mr. Kral was a loving husband and parent, survived by his wife, his son Frederick, his three daughters Joyce, Freda, and Heidi, his sister Betty Lavelle, and his 11 grandchildren. 
Fred Kral was a fine man. A lot of people would say Fred Kral was an average guy, an average American. In many respects he was, but this average man also was a very passionate man, a man who always fought for what he believed. 
Earlier this month, Fred Kral and an estimated 6,000 other seniors in eastern Connecticut were notified through the mail that two Medicare HMOs were discontinuing service in their communities, effectively canceling these seniors' health care plans as of January 1, 1999. 
Three Saturdays ago, Mr. President, I organized a forum at the Rose City Senior Center in Norwich where more than 400 people gathered to discussed these insurance companies' actions and what steps might be taken to preserve their health care. 
At that meeting, Fred Kral spoke eloquently--eloquently--not only on behalf of himself and his wife who, 2 weeks earlier, had a stroke, but on behalf of all the seniors in eastern Connecticut who were worried about their health care and what was going to happen to them when these HMOs left. 
Fred Kral expressed anger and disappointment with his HMO's decision. He specifically voiced his concern for his wife, who recently suffered a stroke, and his fears he might be rejected when he tried to join another plan. He wondered how he could be dropped from the same health care plan that he and his wife were enticed to join only 2 years ago. 
He also said he would be willing to pay higher premiums to keep his health care if that was the only choice. But at the time he wasn't given that option. He and thousands of others were simply told they were being dropped by the same plan that had actively recruited them just 2 years earlier. He summed up the debate best when he said, `It's a moral issue.' 
As he returned to his seat from speaking, Fred Kral suffered cardiac arrest. After efforts to revive him at the scene, he was rushed back to his hospital in Norwich and died shortly before noon on that day. 
This is a tragic incident and an unfortunate way for this honorable man to die. But it is no accident that Fred Kral was at that meeting delivering his speech from the front row of that audience that day. As I said earlier, he was a passionate man about everything he did. He was particularly passionate about this issue. His daughter told me that he was up at 2:30 in the morning the day of the meeting preparing questions. 
Of the hundreds of people attending the forum, Fred Kral had approached me before the event and struck up a conversation. He told me he came to that forum to have his opinions heard. I told him I would recognize him when the forum began. 
I want my colleagues to know about Fred Kral. I want them to know that this debate is not about nameless, faceless beneficiaries. It is about individuals like Fred Kral. He was not a member of some consumer advocacy group, he was just a normal citizen who cared very deeply about health care and HMOs because no other issue had a more direct impact on his life and his family. 
There are a lot of people out in this country who feel the same way about this issue as Fred Kral did. Just look at my own State. In a small community in this small State, there were 400 people who cared enough about this issue to spend their Saturday morning at a health care forum. I guarantee each and every one of my colleagues that there are persons in their home States who have similar worries about their health care, and they want Congress to do something about it. 
Before any of my colleagues say that the health care system in this country doesn't need changing, I urge them, again, to think about Fred Kral of Niantic, CT. Here is a man who lived nearly half a century in the same small town. He served our Nation in World War II. He spent 38 years working to strengthen our national infrastructure, our defense infrastructure. He supported and raised a family, and in his retirement he enjoyed a good round of golf every now and then--in many ways he was your average, solid citizen that we so often talk about. But despite playing by the rules his whole life, he got a letter in the mail from his HMO telling him that they no longer wished to take care of him, just weeks after his wife had suffered a stroke. 
I say to you, my colleagues here, any health care system that allows something like this to happen to someone such as Fred Kral, and 12,000 other Connecticut citizens, is in need of serious examination and review. Therefore, Mr. President, in the small amount of time we have left in this legislative session, I would hope that we in this Congress would do what is right and have a full and open debate on the issues of Medicare HMOs. Four hundred thousand people in the last 2 or 3 weeks who have been dumped by their HMOs deserve better than just silence on this issue. 
I know the hours are waning. I know there is other business to do. But I cannot think of anything that could be more important than helping thousands and thousands of older Americans who, while we are out of session, may find themselves losing affordable health care coverage because their HMO has decided some communities aren t quite as profitable as they thought they d be. 
We must act in the next few days. To be out of session for October and November and December and January while we know there are thousands of people who are worried about whether or not they are going to have HMO coverage, I think is terribly, terribly wrong. 
In closing, Mr. President, Fred Kral's death is certainly a tragedy. It is a tragedy for his family and for the people who knew him and loved him, but it did not come in vain. In southeastern Connecticut, the insurance companies are reconsidering their decision. They announced the Monday following the forum that they will try to come up with some solutions. I hope they do. I am not confident they are going to be terribly comprehensive, but obviously they were mortified, as they should have been, about what occurred. 
So my hope is, Mr. President, that we might be able to at least pass an emergency piece of legislation that would place for the next 6 months a moratorium on HMOs leaving these areas to give us time to work with the Health Care Financing Administration to try and renegotiate some of the contracts and prevent these companies from just packing up and leaving. So in the midst of dealing with all these other lofty bills we have before us, a simple moratorium. I wish that we would get into a full-blown debate of HMOs, but I do fear it is not going to happen. I hoped we would be able to adopt a Patient Protection Act this Congress to allow patients and doctors to decide what medical procedures are necessary and to allow patients to choose their doctors. But for now, I am asking that we consider a simple moratorium on Medicare HMOs leaving the market to give us all time to consider more comprehensive solutions. This is the very least, I think, we can do. 
So, Mr. President, later today I will introduce the moratorium bill and make it retroactive to protect the seniors who have been so adversely affected. I urge our colleagues and the leadership to consider this bill and to adopt it before this 105th Congress adjourns sine die. 
Mr. President, I see no other colleague here on the floor, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise in support of the Reading Excellence Act. I am very pleased that, working with the House committee and Secretary Riley, we have been able to work out a final bill that will improve reading skills. This effort once again demonstrates that when we focus on what really matters to America's families and work together, we can accomplish a great deal of good. And today, we are taking a substantial step in improving the teaching of reading in our schools. 
There are few skills that are more important than literacy. It is what makes us good workers, good parents, and good citizens. Imagine not being able to read. Bus schedules, children's homework assignments, and local newspapers--all beyond your grasp. From start to finish, each day would be nearly impossible. 
Yet, too many of our children leave school lacking this basic skill which is essential to their livelihood and their quality of life. But, for the child who cannot read, the problem begins much earlier than graduation. Research has shown that children who fall behind as early as the second and third grade do not catch up or become fluent readers unless expensive, intensive help is available to them. If such help is not available, these children become increasingly frustrated and are at substantial risk of dropping out of school altogether. 
Our goal must be to help all children to read well, to read independently, and, importantly, to enjoy reading. We have a tremendous advantage today in reaching this goal in that we know so much more about the physiological process of learning to read. We also know what works and what does not. This bill makes sure that this new base of knowledge gets out beyond academia and its scholarly journals and into classrooms across the country where it can make a real difference in the lives of our children. 
Beyond the classroom, this legislation will also help empower the first and most important teacher of all children--their parents. Children's literacy levels are directly related to the literacy ability and interest of their parents, especially their mothers. The values, attitudes and expectations held by parents and other care givers with respect to literacy will have a lasting effect on a child's attitude about learning to read. This bill will encourage parents to read to their children at an early age and foster the budding literacy skills of their children. 
I am particularly pleased the bill also reaches out to Head Start and other local pre-school programs to bring them into these efforts to ensure that young children have the necessary foundation for literacy. In addition, the bill does not overlook the important contribution trained volunteers and mentors can have in improving a child's reading fluency and comprehension. This bill encourages local communities to tap into these efforts and coordinate volunteers to bring their talents and time into the schools to read with children one on one. 
Finally, Mr. President, this bill does not overlook the most basic tool in any literacy effort--Books. Good, engaging, age-appropriate books are critical to any successful effort to improve literacy. In too many homes, books are a rarity. And yet any parent will tell you how books capture the imagination and attention of toddlers and, even babies, better than any television show. 
I think we need to do much more when it comes to books. Our tax laws have set up very perverse incentives that make it more profitable to destroy unsold books rather than donate them to schools or literacy organizations. I am hopeful that, when the Senate next revisits tax law, we can take a look at this issue and reverse these incentives to get more books into the hands of children. In the meantime, this legislation is a good first step in ensuring that children will have increased exposure and involvement with high-quality books. 
Mr. President, this is a good thoughtful bill and I am very pleased that we will complete action on it this year and begin this important effort to improve our children's literacy skills.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. 
Let me quickly join with those who will commend our colleagues from Vermont and Massachusetts, the chair and the ranking member of the full committee, for their terrific work. I also want to thank our colleague from Indiana, Senator Coats, and others, whom the chairman of the committee put together to work on this bill as sort of a working group on higher education. Certainly without their efforts we would not be at the point we are today in proposing what I think is a good bill. 
You can ask families all over this country what concerns them the most. And the answer, time and time again, is education--particularly higher education. Families know that there is little as important to their children's lifelong success as achievement in post-secondary education. 
And families today are worried about higher education. They worry about its cost--which is growing in many instances at outrageous levels. They worry that too many students give up the dream of college long before graduation from high school. And they worry that colleges are not keeping up and educating their children for the next century. 
These are fundamental concerns and they have been the driving force behind this strong legislation. For two years, I have been working with Senator Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, Senator Coats and the other members of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and, in the past few months with the House Education and Workforce Committee, to complete this important bill. And I think our bipartisan efforts have helped produce a bill that will help America's students and families. 
It is a bill that, frankly, I think could have been better--but I believe that we have done a good job with the realities that we face. 
This bill does four things that I think are commendable. One, it addresses the issues of college costs head-on--really for the first time in my memory here that we address this issue. Many of my colleagues may not be aware that over the past 20 years the cost of college has gone up 304 percent as compared to every other area of our economy where inflation has risen about 165 percent. So we are looking at a tremendous increase in college costs for families all across this Nation. 
For the first time, this bill will ensure that families have access to comprehensive, comparable information on cost. I am particularly pleased that these disclosure provisions will be enforced by the Secretary with the strong fine that I authored in the Senate bill. We also authorize a follow-up study on why costs are escalating, as recommended by the Cost of College Commission, and we direct the Bureau of Labor Statistics to develop a market-basket for higher education so that we finally have a workable yardstick with which to judge college costs. 
I think that is a critical issue. Every year we see these costs go up, parents legitimately ask the question why. And while individual institutions can give some reasons, I think we need to get a better handle on that. The provisions in this bill are simply a first step and a warning to colleges: We are serious about this effort and will no longer sit idly by while costs increase far faster than inflation. 
Second, the bill goes right to the heart of the student aid issue. We provide students with significantly improved loan rates, with a reduction in interest of nearly one percent. As a result of lowering the loan rates, students in my State could save as much as $650 a year. That may not seem like a lot to some, but to middle-income families in my State that kind of a savings can make a huge, huge difference. 
I would also point out this bill, of course, raises the maximum amount that can be received under a Pell grant to $4,500. That makes a huge difference, again, for families that fall within the category of receiving that kind of assistance. So we really reach right out to those families with this bill and make a difference for them. 
We also afford students with the largest loans new repayment options that will allow them to extend the time of repayment. And we provide new teachers serving in needy districts with loan forgiveness. 
Third, we finally really understand the role here of the nontraditional student, which is critically important. The nontraditional student, candidly, is becoming the traditional student. The traditional student is the one who goes to college for 3 or 4 years without interruption. Today, more and more students are ones who work, who take a year off from studies while they work to save money to pay for the next year of education. People need education throughout their lives, so they go back to school. This bill really reaches into that community and provides some wonderful opportunities, including things like distance learning. 
Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts has for years talked about the importance of providing educational opportunity for people who do not have the time or the resources to go to a traditional setting but can, through distance learning, acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to improve not only the quality of their lives, but the quality of all of our lives through enhanced educational opportunity. 
This bill would also help the non-traditional student through the high-quality, affordable campus-based child care programs for low-income students which I offered. 
Last, beyond meeting the fundamental concerns of students, this bill will strengthen our educational institutions themselves. This bill fundamentally restructures federal support for teacher training and focuses support on high quality reforms that bring and keep excellent teachers in our classrooms. Plus, we restructured and improved federal support for developing institutions, like community colleges and colleges serving at-risk minority populations. 
I am disappointed we did not include the Wellstone amendment on TANF eligibility for those pursuing post-secondary education. It is clear that education is the best long term solution to ending welfare dependency, but we were frankly unable to move the House conferees on this issue. I want to continue to work to move this initiative forward and pledge to work with Senator Wellstone to identify other legislative vehicles for this important reform. I was also disappointed that we were forced to adopt two provisions--eliminating the bankruptcy discharge of student loans after seven years of repayment and increasing the fee on Ginnie Mae loans--outside of our committee's jurisdiction to ensure that this bill was budget neutral. 
Again, I admit that this legislation is not perfect. But on the whole, I think that this is a very good bill that will help American students and families, and it is evidence of what we are capable of doing when we all work together.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the Consumer Bankruptcy Act of 1998, but I did so with some reservations. I commend the efforts of the members of the Judiciary Committee, especially Senators Durbin and Grassley and Senators Hatch and Leahy in taking on the challenge of reforming this important and highly complex area of our laws. They have made an important effort to bring about some badly needed reforms and hopefully reduce the number of bankruptcies in our country. 
As many of you know, the most recent statistics from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts state that more than 1.4 million people filed for bankruptcy during the 12-month period ending June 30, 1998, an all-time high. This represents an 8.5% increase from the same period last year. Statistics also show that there has been a 400 percent increase in personal bankruptcies since 1980. Clearly we need to reform our bankruptcy laws. 
This bill will provide enhanced procedural protections for consumers, and enhanced penalties for creditors who fail to obey the requirements of the bankruptcy code. It also will crack down on abusive and repeat Chapter 13 filings, discourage predatory home lending practices, and provide for the appointment of new bankruptcy judges. 
Perhaps most importantly, this bill, as opposed to prior versions, provides stronger safeguards for children and families involved in bankruptcy proceedings. Several months ago, I and 30 of my colleagues wrote to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee about the need for this legislation to include stronger safeguards for the children of people involved in bankruptcy proceedings. In simple terms, we voiced our concern that children should come before creditors, which essentially has been the law for the last 95 years. Under current law, outstanding spouse and child support, in addition to back taxes and educational loans, are debts that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy like other debts. This sound policy is premised on the belief that our laws should minimize the risk of impoverishment of our children and families. 
In response to that letter, and my conversation with the Committee Chairman, the Committee Chairman acknowledged the potential adverse consequences the legislation could have upon child support recipients, and he offered an amendment at the full committee mark-up which addressed these problems. The amendment, which passed by a unanimous vote, would raise the legal priority of child support from number 7 to number 1; permit the conditioning of a Chapter 13 confirmation upon the payment of child support payments; allow the conditioning of a Chapter 13 discharge upon the payment of all post-petition child support obligations; and add other provisions that should help children and families collect child support debts. 
I offered and had accepted 3 amendments on the Floor that, in my view, further strengthen this bill. The first amendment would: (1) protect income from sources legitimately dedicated to the welfare of children from being dissipated and misdirected to pay debts and expenses unrelated to the care and maintenance of these same children. Child support payments, foster care payments, or disability payments for a dependent child should go to that child and not to a creditor; and (2) ensure that in bankruptcy, children and families are able to keep certain household goods which typically have no resale value. I am speaking about items such as toys, swings sets, video cassette recorders or other items used to help them raise their children. 
The second amendment would protect duly established college savings accounts which were set up for the benefit of children from being distributed to creditors. Just because a child's family has gone through a bankruptcy does not mean a child should not be able to go to college. 
Lastly, the third amendment, which I co-authored with Senators Sarbanes and Durbin, contains an important new consumer protection regarding credit card debt. Today, many consumers are unaware of the implications of carrying credit card debt and making only the minimum monthly payment on that debt. For instance, assume a consumer has $3000 in credit card debt. Then assume the interest rate that the consumer is paying on that debt is 17 1/2 %, which is roughly the industry average. If the consumer makes only the monthly minimum payment on that debt, it will take 396 months or 33 years to pay it off. And with interest, the consumer will have paid a total of 9,658 dollars. This amendment, which I worked on with Senators Sarbanes, Durbin, Grassley and Hatch will require credit card issuers to inform consumers on their monthly billing statement not only how long it will take them to pay off a debt at the minimum monthly rate, but also how much money they will have paid in interest and principal on that debt. 
I thank Senators Grassley and Durbin and Senators Hatch and Leahy who have worked with me to assure that these protections for children, families and consumers were included in the bill. 
I am disappointed that my amendment regarding the extension of credit to young people under the age of 21 was tabled. This amendment was designed to curtail the most aggressive and abusive credit card marketing to people under the age of 21 by requiring that the credit card issuer obtain an application that either contained the signature of a parent or guardian willing to take financial responsibility for the debt, or information indicating an independent means of repaying any credit extended. Most responsible credit card issuers already obtain this information from their applicants. This amendment would have merely required that the less responsible credit card issuers follow the `best practices' already in place for much of the industry. 
I am, at the same time, concerned that this legislation will force more debtors into Chapter 13 bankruptcy while eliminating several of the provisions that enabled debtors to meet the terms of their Chapter 13 payment plan considering the fact that two-thirds of the repayment plans under current law are not completed, this calls into question whether Chapter 13 really results in the repayment of debts, as advertised. 
Moreover, I'm concerned, not withstanding strong objections by the National Partnership for Women and Families, more than 20 women's groups, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and a variety of other organizations, that new provisions regarding the non-dischargeability of certain types of unsecured debt remain in the bill. These groups expressed their concern that these provisions will impede the ability of debtors to pay both for their post-bankruptcy expenses and to care for their dependents. I hope the Conference looks into these issues more carefully so that we can truly accomplish balanced and effective bankruptcy reform.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, most of us are aware that there is a very serious computer problem, the year 2000 computer problem or Y2K problem, which has the potential to dramatically disrupt our energy, transportation, banking and health sectors, just to name a few. 
As most of you know, the year 2000 computer technology problem stems from the earlier programing of two digit date codes; many old programs were written assuming the year would begin with `19.' Therefore the year-2000 computer problem means that if an unknown number of programs and microchips around the world aren't fixed or replaced, computers that read `00' as the year 1900, not 2000 will fail or malfunction on January 1, 2000. 
To correct this problem millions of dollars have been earmarked by government and industry to identify, correct and test the millions of lines of code and embedded chips that perform mission-critical functions. 
Senator Bennett and I co-chair the Senate's Year 2000 Committee and we are actively reviewing the progress of U.S. industry and government agencies. Both must bring their own systems into compliance and the government agencies must monitor the compliance status of the areas that they regulate. 
This is truly a world-wide phenomenon, and while the United States is doing a pretty good job of playing catch up, many nations of the world have hardly begun to address their own year 2000 or Y2K problems. 
From time to time I will come to the Senate floor to brief the other Members and the public on the progress of the committee's work and the highlight problems areas. 
One such problem area was highlighted during the committee's hearing on health concerns. Whereas, in many industries, there are areas termed mission-critical which refers to embedded or coded systems without which the primary objective of that system fails. In the health field, there are life-critical systems which sustain human life. An example of a life-critical embedded system would be a cardiac monitor in the intensive-care unit of a hospital. If it fails, the patient could lose his or her life. 
With this in mind I was deeply disturbed to learn, during one of the committee's earlier hearings, that the FDA's attempts to survey and document year 2000 compliance within the medical device industry had indicated an unacceptable low level of response. At the committee's July 23, 1998 hearing on the health care industry, I was shocked by the fact that instead of taking steps to deal with this problem, the medical device industry, as a whole, at that time, seemed to be exacerbating the problem by refusing to provide information either to the FDA or to even the hospitals and clinics which use the devices every day. I made it clear that this sort of attitude was stunningly short-sighted and could only cause harm to both the makers and users of these devices. Indeed, the committee learned that the FDA on June 28, 1998 requested that the nearly 2000 medical device manufacturers immediately respond and indicate their level of year 2000 compliance. This initial lack of response was indeed irresponsible. According to the FDA, of the nearly 1,935 medical manufacturers surveyed, approximately 755 replied. 
Let me repeat this. Of the nearly 2,000 manufactures of life-critical medical devices, the FDA tells us that less than 40 percent responded to the oversight agency tasked with insuring that critical medical devices still work when you and I and the people we love are in need and might depend on this sophisticated equipment. 
Again this is unacceptable. I am therefore submitting a list of those manufacturers that did not reply to the FDA's request for information to the Record for all Americans to see. It is my hope that these companies quickly comply and provide information as to the year 2000 readiness of these critical medical devices. It is also my hope that this will serve as a wake up call to other industries to be vigilant, responsible and pro-active in their efforts to insure that Americans wake up to a wonderful new year on January first of the year 2000.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, we want to wrap this bill up, I gather, fairly quickly. I want to extend my congratulations to Senator Grassley of Iowa, Senator Hatch, my colleague from Utah, and Senator Durbin, the manager for this side of the aisle on this legislation. It has been a long journey for them, I know, in committee in trying to deal with this legislation. I am particularly grateful for the courtesies which they have extended to me, and for the various ideas we have had for inclusion in this legislation.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment is a third amendment to two others that have been offered and have actually been included in the managers' amendment. 
I thank, again, Senator Hatch, Senator Durbin, Senator Grassley, and others for their consideration. 
This amendment, the third, is designed to protect children who through no fault of their own are involved in bankruptcy. It provides legal and legitimate college savings accounts established for the benefit of children which will be beyond the reach of creditors. 
This amendment parallels Senator Hatch's provisions to protect retirement savings accounts, and particularly contains measures to prevent fraudulent transfers of assets intended solely to avoid the rightful reach of creditors. So we have written into this the exact same kind of parallel provisions that the seniors' retirement accounts include. 
The amendment complements other provisions that are included in the managers' amendment. Those provisions ensure that the lawful funds for the benefit of children--such as child support, disability payments, and foster care payments--would also be preserved for children and not creditors. 
Again, that goes back almost 100 years in trying to see to it that innocent children are not going to be harmed and hurt as a result of this process. 
In addition, we agreed that household goods exclusively and primarily for children, such as toys, children's furnishings, and items used by parents provided for their children, would also be protected. 
Again, it was a consensus. I commend my colleagues for recognizing that these issues are important as well. 
Taken together, the provisions of this amendment and the managers' amendment will continue the 95-year-old principle of the bankruptcy code that women and children must be first in bankrupt credit alliances. 
I believe that these important improvements in the bill reinforce the historic protections that are given families in bankruptcy proceedings. Those who are innocent and most vulnerable deserve the most protection. 
I am very grateful, as I said a moment ago, to the chairman of the full committee and the subcommittee and the ranking member, Senator Durbin, who has worked hard to ensure these protections for children and families were not weakened in the pending legislation. 
In the rush that was going on around here a number of weeks ago, we almost blew by these historic protections which we provide for families. As a result of their leadership, these protections have been included in legislation. I am confident that in conference they will preserve them. 
This amendment would strengthen the principle that children ought to come before credit card companies. Legal proceedings, including bankruptcy proceedings, should be designed to protect against the impoverishment of children and innocent adults. Otherwise, impoverishment will produce dependency, in which case no one wins--neither the individual impoverished, nor the credit card company. 
I also would like to express for the record my concern that my colleagues in conference firmly support the Senate legislation. I think it is critically important that we hold these provisions. 
Again, we all recognize the importance of this legislation. There has been a flood of people taking advantage of the Bankruptcy Act. Too many have been doing that. This legislation is going to tighten that up considerably. But I think as we call for a higher degree of responsibility on the part of our citizenry when it comes to their fiscal and financial responsibility, it is also incumbent that we ask the credit card companies to exercise responsibility as well. 
This legislation, I think, strikes a good balance between stopping the incredible amount of people taking advantage of the Bankruptcy Act with little or no repercussions, it would appear, and also seeing to it that the innocents--particularly children--are not going to be adversely affected by this process. 
As has been noted by some of our colleagues over the last week or so, as you consider this bill, just last year alone 3 billion credit card solicitations were sent out across this country, many with already preapproved proposals. 
I hope that credit card companies will exercise some restraint and responsibility in trying to slow down what is an exploding amount of consumer debt in this country. During good times, no one talks about it much. But when you get a downturn in the economy, it becomes a major problem. There is corporate debt, and consumer debt. We have to try to get a better handle on it. 
I am very grateful to the managers of the legislation--I see my colleague from Iowa has arrived on the floor as well as the Senator from Utah--and for their consideration of this amendment. 
As I said, it tracks Senator Hatch's very good amendment on seniors' retirement accounts to see to it that education is 
going to be something that we continue to support as strongly as we have for the 21st century because of rising college costs, to see to it that these educational accounts are going to be for the children that need them. I think it is a very wise decision. Indeed, I am grateful for their support.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask my colleague to yield for a minute on that point, if I could. Let me again thank him for his courtesies and his staff's courtesies over the last number of days in working this out. He has made a very good point. What we will certainly try to do here--and I agree with him--is to see to it that this amendment, the safeguard aspects of it, conform in many ways--exactly, if it is not the case--with the retirement savings accounts since both are parallel ideas. I have instructed my staff to work with the Senator's staff to iron out those details, to check this out thoroughly. Obviously, I think we all agree this is needed to protect the long-term education needs of families, but obviously--and I want to state it very clearly--it certainly also is our intention to see to it that people are not given an opportunity to avoid their responsibilities when it comes to their financial matters. So we think we can do that pretty effectively. 
My intention and that of the Senator from Iowa is to see that it is done before this bill goes to the President for his signature. I thank him again for his support.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in light of the recent vote on national missile defense, I feel compelled to explain my position on this important issue. In short, I agree with this Nation's senior military officers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Each of them opposes the National Missile Defense bill, and they provided a detailed explanation of their position in a letter they sent to Capitol Hill prior to the vote. 
The National Missile Defense bill would require that a national missile defense system be deployed as soon as it is `technologically feasible.' Conversely, the current plan calls for the Defense Department, by the year 2000, to research and develop such a system and then be able to deploy it within three years. This policy allows us to develop our capabilities in view of developing threats rather than run the risk of deploying a system that proves to be ineffective. In the absence of a current long range ballistic missile threat from a rogue state, this is the most reasonable policy. 
Research and development of a National Missile Defense system is advancing at an accelerated pace. Most weapons systems require six to twelve years before they are fully developed and ready to be deployed, but under the current timetable, the National Missile Defense system will spend as little as three years in the development phase. This represents the Defense Department's strong commitment to protecting the United States from an intercontinental missile attack. That commitment is backed by billions of dollars in funding. The nation will spend nearly a billion dollars on national missile defense during the next fiscal year alone. 
The National Missile Defense bill would not have advanced the timetable for developing and deploying a missile defense system. What it would have done is lock this nation in to buying a yet-to-be-developed system against an unknown threat for an unidentified sum of money. A decision to buy a system at such an early stage would not only have been unprecedented, but it could have sapped funding from programs that are directed at addressing existing threats. For example, the Joint Chiefs of Staff pointed out that a weapon of mass destruction may presently be delivered through unconventional, terrorist-style means, yet a national missile defense system would not address that threat. 
This bill would have had a detrimental impact on arms control agreements. Had the United States gone forward to deploy a National Missile Defense system as the bill required, this nation would have violated the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. Additionally, it might have caused Russia to withdraw from the START I Treaty and certainly would have prevented the ratification of the START II Treaty. The intercontinental ballistic missile threat to this nation will be intensified if Russia retains hundreds of additional nuclear weapons as a result broken agreements. The current policy, continued research and development of a system, would not violate arms control agreements or cause Russia to withdraw from treaties that place important limitations on both nations' missiles. 
In conclusion, although I oppose this National Missile Defense bill, I feel strongly that there is an important place for missile defense in our national security strategy. There have been some important advancements in the development of both theater and national missile defense systems that will surely benefit this nation in the future. Our efforts along these lines must continue. Considering all of our defense and non-defense priorities, however, now is not the time to rush forward with a decision to deploy an undeveloped national missile defense system.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on August 7, 1998, Andres Pastrana Arango was sworn in as the 60th President of Colombia, 28 years after his father, Misael Pastrana, took the same oath of office. A former journalist, mayor of Bogota, and Senator, president candidate Andres Pastrana swept into office with the largest electoral margin in his country's history. 
With the election of President Pastrana I believe that a new opportunity has been created for the United States and Colombia to work closely together to deal with issues of mutual concern to our two countries. I very much hope that both of our governments will take advantage of this opening because it is in the interests of both countries that we do so. 
In his inaugural speech of August 7, President Pastrana set forth his agenda for his term of office. Breaking the stranglehold of major narcotrafficking organizations and bringing peace to Colombia are among President Pastrana's highest priorities. During the course of his address, he laid out his plans to end the 34 year old civil war and to counter drug trafficking and the violence and corruption it brings with it. In order to tackle the financial, political and social problems of his country, he also pledged to undertake a complete turnaround in Colombia's Government during his administration. 
I believe that President Pastrana has been very quick in shaping the outline of policies and programs that should help to strengthen democratic institutions in Colombia and respect for human rights. His inaugural address gives me hope that the United States working together with the Government of Colombia can make that a reality. I would urge my colleagues to take the opportunity to read for themselves President Pastrana's Inaugural address. I ask unanimous consent that his address be printed in full at the conclusion of my remarks.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask that I use, say, 5 minutes and be notified when 5 minutes have transpired so that the author of the amendment has some additional time at the end to conclude his remarks. 
Mr. President, there is little question that the surcharges seem to have become the No. 1 complaint by many consumers and consumer groups all across the Nation. Part of the reason for the increasing complaints in this area is the speed with which the surcharges have become attached to the ATM machines. 
Frankly, I say to the Chair, and my colleagues, I was not an early supporter of the prohibition of these fees. When it was first proposed by the Senator from New York, I argued that we ought to let the market dictate how these fees would be set, convinced, as had happened with the credit card issue, that competition within the marketplace actually had the desired effect of creating a good level, a less decent level, and an understandable and rational level for fees and surcharges and grace periods, and the like, when it comes to credit cards. 
It was my hope that would occur here with the ATM issue. The problem is that it just hasn't happened at all. We have had the opposite effect, in fact. Banks seem to have become more interested in acting like sort of an electronic Jesse James--taking their cut when the consumer wants to get access to their money. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office puts this a little more seriously in their study, noting: 
Paradoxically, the increase in supply of ATM machines has not led to the kind of reduction that would generally follow from supply and demand solutions. 
This is the Congressional Budget Office testimony. My concern over the practice of surcharging was augmented by some other developments as well. 
First was the decision by a major national bank to sue the State of Connecticut, my home State, to overturn my State's ban on surcharges. This demonstrated to me that the banking industry was unwilling to allow the individual States to make their own public policy decisions about this practice. As a result, it has become very clear that only Federal legislation would allow my State of Connecticut to maintain the protections for its citizens that it has chosen to enact. 
In fact, the attorney general of my State, Richard Blumenthal, came to Washington and testified strongly in favor of the D'Amato amendment. Let me quote him. He said: 
Federal legislation is vitally necessary to clarify our State's ability [a State rights issue] to enact such a prohibition. In addition, Federal legislation is necessary to ensure that consumers are protected from such fees whenever they use an ATM. 
Also, let me note that despite Connecticut's ATM surcharge ban, the largest bank in my State announced, on July 14, that it was going to close some branches and open more ATMs around the State. The results rebut the argument that banks won't open new ATMs if this amendment passes. This is a living example where you have a ban, a moratorium on any new surcharges, and, yet, they are expanding the ATMs in my State. 
So, clearly this ban, this legislation that is being offered by the Senator from New York, would not produce the results that its opponents are claiming. 
Second, community banks in my State have expressed deep concerns that ATM surcharging could be used to give large banks with extensive proprietary networks an unfair advantage over community banks with fewer machines. Smaller banks are worried about this--not only consumers, but smaller banks are. This 
is particularly troublesome because of the regulatory and legislative decisions that allow banks to use the ATMs in the first place where, based upon the concept of universal access to the network, the large banks are reneging on that commitment. That is how they got this in the first place. This was going to be universal access. They have basically backed off that commitment. 
Lastly, I have become very concerned over changes in bank underwriting standards for commercial loans and for credit card companies, which I have raised before and which was the subject of a front page Washington Post article today. It is a great concern where you have now these normal banking fees being replaced by surcharges and the like as a way of offsetting lowering the standards for credit. This ought to be a great concern of all of us. And the Washington Post article highlights this. You can lower your standard on credit card allocation, because you can make up whatever the losses would be in this area. I think putting this issue aside is a very dangerous road for us to be going. 
As I reviewed the materials in preparation for the Banking Committee hearing, I couldn't help but be struck by the fact that loan standards and credit card underwriting standards have slipped as revenues from fees, which are almost pure profit, have escalated. I can't help but wonder whether the profit from these fees--$3 billion in ATM fees and $1.1 billion from fees charged their own customers when someone else bounces a check--aren't giving bank officials a false sense of security about their lending practices. If true, then this may be the most corrosive effect aspect of the recent boom in consumer banking fees of all types. 
For those reasons, Mr. President, I believe the D'Amato amendment deserves to be adopted by this body. I urge my colleagues to do so.  
Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, one of the most troubling developments in the hotly contested battle among the credit card issuers to sign up new customers has been the aggressive way in which they have targeted people under the age of 21, particularly college students. We are engaged, obviously, in a debate about the bankruptcy bill here. The authors of this bill, and I commend them for it, recognize there has been an explosion of people who are taking advantage of the Bankruptcy Act to avoid their financial obligations. 
It seems appropriate in the context of this bill that we also recognize that there has been an explosion of efforts to sign up younger people, particularly on college campuses, to credit cards, recognizing that, as many have pointed out, these students are ill prepared to meet their own financial obligations. Inevitably, they either incur debt and end up in tremendous difficulty or their parents assume the responsibilities, which can occur with upper-income people who can afford it. 
Just this past August, to make the point, a fellow by the name of John Simpson, who is an administrator at the University of Indiana, said: 
This is a terrible thing. We lose more students to credit card debt than academic failure, at the University of Indiana. 
What I am trying to lay out here is a proposal that is not outrageous. Basically, what it says is if you are between the ages of 18 and 21--no contract is valid for someone under 18, so a credit card obligation for someone under 18 would be voided anyway. But between 18 and 21, either show that individual has independent economic means--a job or whatever--or parental permission. If you can do that, fine, then you can market and issue a credit card to those individuals. We set up separate standards on drinking in this country for those 21 and under, and for tax purposes. It seems to me this little window in here could save an awful lot of students, an awful lot of families, the kind of hardship. 
Let me lay out the case for you here on a factual basis. Solicitations to this age group have become more intense for a variety of reasons. First, it is one of the few market segments in which there are always new faces to go after. It is also an age group in which brand loyalty can be established. In the words of one major credit card issuer, we are in the relationship business and we want to build relationships early on. Recent press stories have reported that people hold on to their first credit card for up to 15 years. 
In fact, people under the age of 21 are such a hot target for credit card marketers that the upcoming card marketing conference this year--this is the card marketing conference 1998, which is going to be held in Las Vegas. They have a seminar beginning at 12 noon on the day of this conference that is entitled `Targeting Teens: You Never Forget Your First Card,' to give you an idea of how much a part of this the credit card companies have in mind. As I say, this is indicating their deep interest in this constituency. 
Credit card issuers are also enticing colleges and universities to help promote their products. Professor Robert Manning at Georgetown University here in Washington told my staff that some colleges receive tens of thousands of dollars per year for exclusive marketing agreements. Other colleges receive as much as 1 percent of all student charges from credit card issuers in return for marketing or affinity agreements. 
Even those colleges who don't enter into such agreements are making money. Robert Bugai, president of College Marketing Intelligence, told the American Banker that colleges charge up to $400 per day for each credit card company that sets up a table on campus. That can run into the tens of thousands of dollars by the end of just one semester. 
Last February, I went to the main campus of the University of Connecticut to meet with student leaders about this issue. Quite honestly, I was surprised by the amount of solicitations going on in the student union, and I was also surprised the degree to which the students themselves were concerned about the constant barrage of offers they were receiving. 
The offers seemed very attractive, Mr. President. One student intern in my office this summer received four solicitations in just 2 weeks. One promised `get eight cheap flights now while you still have 18 weeks of vacation.' That is the solicitation, part of it geared to this young woman in my employment. 
Another promised a platinum card with what appeared to be a low interest rate, until you read, of course, the fine print that it applied only to balance transfers, not to the account overall. 
Only one of the four, Discover card, offered a brochure about credit terms, but in doing so, often offered a spring break sweepstakes in order to attract these students. In fact, the Chicago Tribune reported just last month that the average college freshman will receive 50 solicitations during their first few months at college. The Tribune further reported that college students get green-lighted for a line of credit that can reach more than $10,000 just on the strength of a signature and a student identification card. 
Mr. President, there is a serious public policy question about whether people in that age bracket can be presumed to be able to make the sensible financial choices that are being forced on them from this barrage of marketing. While it is very difficult to get reliable information from the credit card issuers about their marketing practices to people under the age of 21, those statistics that are available are deeply, deeply troubling. 
The American Banker newspaper reported that Visa found that 8.7 percent of bankruptcy filers were under the age of 25. A Chicago Tribune article from August 16 of this year cited that bankruptcies `among those under 25 have doubled over the last 5 years from 250,000 to 500,000.' 
The bankruptcy legislation, the underlying bill, is going to make it harder to take the bankruptcy act. I understand that. I am not opposed to that idea. But if simultaneously you are going out and aggressively sending eight solicitations to an 18-year-old in my office promising them free vacation breaks or flights, I think there is something wrong here. 
I don't mind getting tougher on the bankruptcy laws, but I think we have to get a little tougher to say the 18-, 19- and 20-years-olds who have no independent financial means and without parental permission are getting signed up merely on a student ID card and signature, incurring $10,000 worth of debt. 
The same survey found that 27 percent of undergraduate student applicants had four or more credit cards--27 percent, four or more credit cards--and found that 14 percent had credit card balances between $3,000 and $7,000, while 10 percent had credit card balances greater than $7,000. This figure of 24 percent with credit card debts in excess of $3,000 is more than double the number from last year. 
Moreover, while there is evidence that student debt is skyrocketing, some surveys by credit card issuers themselves show that this same group of consumers is woefully uninformed about the basic credit card terms and issues. A 1993 American Express/Consumer Federation of America study found that only 22 percent of more than 2,000 college students surveyed knew that the annual percentage rate is the best indicator of the true cost of a loan. Only 30 percent of those surveyed knew that each bank set the interest rate on their credit card, so that it is possible to shop around for the best rate. Only 30 percent knew that interest was charged on new purchases if you carry a balance over from the previous month. 
Some college administrators, bucking the trend to use credit card issuers as a source of income, have become so concerned that they have banned credit card companies from their campuses and have even gone so far as to ban credit card advertisements from the campus bookstores. Roger Witherspoon, Vice President of Student Development at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, banned card solicitors saying indebtedness was causing students to drop out:  
Middle-class parents can bail out their kids when this happens, but lower-income parents can't-- 
Mr. Witherspoon said in an interview. 
Kids only find out later how much it messes up their lives. 
That is a quotation from the American Banker. 
The amendment I am proposing today does not take any such Draconian action against the credit card companies. Let me state, by the way--and I should have said this at the outset--many credit card companies do require parental notice or approval or evidence of independent means. There are many who do this, but there are some who do not at all. As most laws, it is not targeted to those who show good judgment and good sense, but to the few who do not. Unfortunately, here we have a few who do not at all. 
This amendment does not go so far as to ban credit cards or ban advertising. It merely says, look, between the ages of 18 and 21, either show you have the independent means to meet the obligations or get a signature from a parent that they understand that their child is about to take out a credit card. 
I agree with those who argue, as I said, there are millions of people under the age of 21 who hold full-time jobs who are as deserving of credit as anyone over the age of 21. I agree with that. I also believe students should continue to have access to credit, and we should not prohibit the market from making that available. 
I also recognize the period of time from 18 to 21 is an age of transition from adolescence to adulthood, and as we do many places in Federal law, extra care is needed to make sure mistakes made from youthful inexperience does not haunt these people for the rest of their lives or a good part of it. 
All my amendment does is require a credit card issuer, prior to granting credit, to obtain one of two things from the applicant under 21: Either they get the signature of a parent or guardian, or they obtain information that demonstrates the existence of an independent means of paying off the amount of credit offered. 
Federal law already says people under age 21 shouldn't drink alcohol. Our Tax Code makes the presumption if someone is a full-time student under the age of 23 that they are financially dependent on their parents or their guardians. 
Is it so much really to ask that credit card issuers, in the midst of a bankruptcy bill that will make it tougher for people to take this act, is it so much to ask that we try to find out if someone under the age of 21 is financially capable of paying back their debt or that their parents are willing to assume the financial responsibility? 
Mr. President, it is my understanding that most, as I said, responsible credit card issuers already require this information in one form or another. Is it too much to ask the entire credit card industry to strive to meet their own best practices when it comes to our children? 
Mr. President, I do not believe this amendment is either unduly burdensome on the credit card industry nor is it unfair to the people under the age of 21. The fact of the matter is that these abusive solicitations assume that if the young adult is unable to pay, they will be bailed out by their parents. Many times this means that parents must sacrifice other things in order to make sure their child does not start out their adult life in a financial hold with an ugly black mark on their credit history. 
By adopting this amendment, Mr. President, the Senate will send a clear message to those aggressive credit card companies that we will no longer countenance this abusive behavior. This amendment corrects that behavior by making those overly aggressive companies, credit companies, exercise their best judgment--instead of their most craven instincts--when it comes to people obtaining their own credit cards for the very first time. 
Mr. President, I note as well in an interview on an NPR program just a few days ago on this very issue, Nancy Lloyd, who is the editor-at-large for Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine, had this to say about this practice. She said:  
. . . that the real reason that credit-card companies are going after college students is that they know that after a parent has spent several tens of thousands of dollars to educate their student, that if they fall behind on their bills that the parent will bail them out, even though legally they don't really have to [if they are younger than 18]. 
Mr. President, I do not think this is a radical proposal here. It is again a huge problem. NBC, I think last evening, ran a special report on the `Fleecing of America' where they talked about this problem. I think there have been a number of other reports on this. 
We began this issue last December in raising the question when I went to my own campuses in Connecticut, as I mentioned a moment ago, to find out how widespread this was. And, again, the information we have been able to gather indicates, I think based on the data we have, limited as it is, that this is a growing problem. The debt has doubled now in the last year. It is going to get worse. 
If we adopt the underlying bill, which I hope we do, then obviously the ability to use the Bankruptcy Act to excuse obligations are going to get tougher. So it seems to me if we are going to do a favor to the banks by making it tougher for people to avoid their financial responsibilities, which we should, we should also send a message that we do not believe you ought to be dumping, as we did last year in this country, 3 billion credit card solicitations but particularly dumping these where there is a student ID and a signature from a 19-year-old, without independent means or parental approval, to assume $3,000, $4,000, $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, $8,000, $9,000, $10,000 worth of financial debt. I think that is wrong. I think we ought to try to stop it. I think this amendment brings us in the right direction, and I urge its adoption.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his eloquent, and if it weren't so sad, quite humorous story. 
Unfortunately, Brendon is not alone. This wasn't just a mistake. Unfortunately, parents can tell you all across the country that this happens with regularity. 
Let me address, if I can, the argument of my good friend and colleague from Utah and why he is opposed to this bill. The great irony is the 20-year-old who is out working and not in college is disadvantaged. That individual has to prove that they have independent economic means. 
Listen to this recent report:  
All the rules have been suspended when it comes to college students. They get a green light, a line of credit that can reach more than $10,000 just on the strength of a signature and a student ID. Almost comically, [the report says], low standards become much different after graduation and bona fide adulthood. 
So the individual who is out working, who is not in school, who may have a real need for a credit card, has to go through far many more hoops than the students between the ages of 18 and 21 who can get these solicitations. 
This wasn't Brendon. This was a 19-year-old--get eight cheap flights now while you still have 18 weeks of vacation. How about a platinum card to a 19-year-old without any indication of whether or not she can meet her payments? 
I don't think it is outrageous to say, look, just show your independent economic means. You have a job, fine. Or get a parental signature. That is not asking too much. Just listen to the administrators at these universities. 
 A terrible thing. We lose more students to credit card debt than academic failure now. The numbers have doubled. It is not overreaching to say to an 18- or 19-year-old that we are going to insist that you prove an independent economic ability to pay--the same as an 18- or 19-year-old would have to do were they not in college--or have a parental signature. Everybody knows that if you are under 18, you can't enter into a contract and have it binding. People have said, `Why not just make it 18?' Well, those contracts don't hold up and the bankruptcy laws would not cover it. 
So between 18 and 21, we are just trying to cover those areas here, statistically. I talked about this study that was done and I failed to identify who did it. Nellie Mae, a major student loan provider in New England, conducted a survey of students who had applied for student loans. `The results of the credit card examination is alarming.' Those are their words, not mine. They found that 27 percent of the undergraduate student applicants had four or more credit cards, and 14 percent of the credit card balances, debt, between $3,000 and $7,000, and 10 percent in excess of $7,000. That is before they graduated from college, in addition to student loans. 
So our efforts here--while the credit card companies see this, apparently, as draconian--will provide relief in the underlying bill. Requiring a little higher standard for college students before they get credit cards is not asking too much. I know the ranking member on the committee wanted to be heard on this, and I see my colleague from Utah.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois. 
Just to make the case once again, we have watched consumer debt double to $455 billion in the last couple of years. It has tripled and quadrupled. It seems to me that to listen to what university people are saying, we have more people dropping out of school--as the official at the University of Indiana said, `We lose more students to credit card debt than academic failure'--we have some indication of what is going on here. To say between the ages of 18 and 21 just to get a parental signature, or an indication of independent economic means, as you would if you were not a student, is not asking too much. It seems to me that is the bare minimum standard of what we ought to be asking of the credit card companies. It is my understanding that most responsible credit card issuers already require them. 
Is it asking too much that the credit card companies strive to meet their own best practices in order to do something to protect our children? 
If you are under 18, the law already protects you. It is that window between 18 and 21. 
Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues will recognize that it is really not fair for middle-income families to get saddled with a $10,000 debt because of solicitations that were made to a student in school. This is a license for us to do something about it.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the efforts recently made by the U.S. National Commission on Libraries to mobilize resources for the purpose of curbing youth violence in this nation. 
Youth violence in America is, undeniably, a serious and frightening problem today. The recent string of highly publicized school shootings has made this all too clear; over the last ten months, 15 people have died and 42 have been wounded. This terrifying epidemic has spread across the country--from Mississippi to Pennsylvania to Washington. As a result, cities such as Jonesboro, Arkansas, and Springfield, Oregon, will remain burned in the public mind, forever associated with terror, heartbreak, and inexplicable tragedy. When faced with the all too horrifying reality of children killing children, teachers, even parents, the nation is shaken to its core, as common associations of youth and innocence are violently broken. Citizens are left to mourn and to ask the inevitable question: Why? 
But wondering why is not enough. Innovative action is required if future tragedies are to be prevented. And the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information Science is leading the way, having committed itself to just such action. The Commission is a permanent, independent agency of the federal government charged by Congress to advise the President and the Congress on national and international library and information policies and plans. On July 8, 1998, the members of the Commission unanimously approved a resolution that urges all of society--community officials, educators, parents, role models--to support efforts made by libraries to assist adults, youth, and children in finding, through valuable learning resources and experiences, solutions to this outbreak of violence. The Commission's recognition of the important and constructive role libraries can play in the lives of America's children is commendable. It is commitment like this that may help to curb the terrifying tide of violence--both in the school and in the home.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I come to the Senate floor to pay tribute to a man of uncommon character and faith, whom I am fortunate to call a friend: Monsignor Henry J. Dziadosz. For almost three decades, Monsignor Dziadosz has served as the Pastor at St. Bridget's of Kildare Church in Moodus, Connecticut, of which I am a member. And for half a century, he has inspired countless people through his works as a Catholic Priest in Connecticut. After his many years of service and guidance, Monsignor Dziadosz is retiring, and I wish to offer my praise for the Monsignor on this special occasion. 
Monsignor Dziadosz is a spiritual father for the parishioners of St. Bridget's, and he has overseen the transformation of the church--both physically and spiritually. 
On Easter Sunday, 1971, two years after being named the Pastor, he announced the proposed restoration and renovation of the congregation's original church: Old St. Bridget's on North Moodus Road. The church had been the home of Catholic worshipers from 1867 to 1958, and Monsignor believed that its preservation would serve as a monument to the perseverance of its parishioners. With the help of many volunteers, the old church was dedicated on Memorial Day 1971, and the renovation was known as the `Miracle of Moodus.' 
He also oversaw the construction of an outdoor pavilion at the church in 1976. And in a show of the Monsignor's dedication to the improvement of religious education, the church opened its Religious Education Center in 1983. 
But the true impact that Monsignor Dziadosz had on St. Bridget's parish is not measured in mortar and brick, it is measured in the spirit of the congregation. 
Monsignor has always said that one of his goals at the church was to create a spirit of community where no member of the parish would ever feel alone, either in times of despair or happiness. He knows that we all face challenges in our life, and when we support one another we can work through our difficulties and overcome them. Through his hard work and dedication, he was able to create such a spirit of togetherness at St. Bridget's, and for that, I and many others are thankful. 
He brought an energetic approach to the church, and he was not afraid to challenge convention in order to do what he felt was best for the congregation. He always taught the virtues of tolerance and worked to break down barriers and bring people together. He also challenged people to ask more from themselves and to show more concern and compassion for those persons in the community and the world who are less fortunate. 
He also felt that St. Bridget's should not only serve the parish, but the community at large. He opened the doors of the church for members of local protestant delegations to hold their worship services. He also allowed senior groups and other organizations to use church facilities. He even had a generator installed on the church premises so that the church may serve as a haven in case of emergencies or natural disasters. In addition, he singlehandedly raised $50,000 for the construction of a chapel and convent for the cloistered Carmelite sisters of Roxas City, the Philippines, proving that his compassion and concern for others extends far beyond any physical borders. 
On the occasion of his retirement, I think it is appropriate to look back at some of the words that Monsignor Dziadosz spoke at the time that the parish celebrated his 25th year at St. Bridget's. He said, `We can never say we've done it, we've reached our goal.' 
In certain respects he's right, because life is an ongoing process, and our goals are constantly changing. But, in the end, I think that anyone who knows Monsignor Dziadosz would say that he's wrong. Monsignor Dziadosz not only reached his goals, he exceeded them. 
His retirement is a time of great loss for the parish, but more important, it is a time for celebration. His words and actions have been a source of inspiration and strength for countless individuals through the years, and his guidance will be dearly missed. On behalf of the people of St. Bridget's and the people of Connecticut, I say thank you Monsignor, and may God bless you.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have brief remarks about this amendment. It is focused on two countries, Guatemala and Honduras. It is not worldwide. It is designed to try to have documents declassified, dating back to a decade ago. Many people recall the tragedies of the conflict in Central America. It actually goes back more than two decades. In the case of Guatemala, it goes back 30 or 40 years. 
Civil wars have now been concluded. There are democratically led governments moving in a direction to try to address their underlying economic and social needs. The conflict that plagued these countries and ourselves cost the lives of thousands of people, as well as thousands more who were injured and brutalized in those conflicts. 
We are seeking with this amendment to declassify certain information that might allow us, in the case particularly of an American citizen who was brutalized in that conflict almost a decade ago, to gather necessary information so that those who perpetrated the crimes against her could be brought to the bar of justice. 
The Clinton administration has already agreed in principle to assist the Guatemalan and Honduran authorities investigating past human rights abuses that occurred during this period. These investigations are critical to these societies being able to complete the process of reconciliation and establish a credible foundation on which to build democratic institutions which truly reflect the rule of law and to put an end to impunity. 
While some U.S. agencies have already responded very fully and positively to these requests, others appear to have done little or nothing meaningful to review and turn over materials that could be critical to the success of this exercise. The slowness of certain agencies in the production of materials, in some cases which are totally nonresponsive to these requests, have caused a level of cynicism about the commitment of some agencies to fully support this effort. 
I know my colleagues, Senator Leahy and Senator McConnell, are very familiar with the case of the American citizen, Sister Diana Ortiz, who was abducted and brutally raped and tortured while serving in a rural community in Guatemala in 1989. Not surprisingly, Sister Ortiz's life has never been the same. Her efforts to shed light on the details of the crimes against her have been met with indifference, at best. As is too often the case in rape cases, she believes that rather than being viewed as the victim, she has been treated by certain government officials as a perpetrator of some crime or involved in nefarious behavior. I don't think the 101 cigarette burns on her back would indicate necessarily at all that someone was the perpetrator rather than the victim. 
Just today, I received a very moving letter from Sister Ortiz. Attached to her letter was a statement that she recently gave laying out some of the new information about her case. Let me quote from her letter, because I think it helps explain why I am offering this amendment today. Sister Ortiz writes: 
Despite my efforts, I still don't know the truth of why I was abducted and tortured. It is true that government agencies have released documents to me. They consist of such public items as articles written by the press, human rights reports from the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala, documents relating to cases other than my own, and letters written to Members of Congress. I have also received blank sheets of white paper. 
Mr. President, this is not just some isolated document. This is basically what a lot of the released documents look like here. This is declassified human rights documents, blank pages: `Honduran armed services human rights and corruption.' A blank page. 
Here is another example of the declassified documents released on her case:

If I could be notified by my staff, or others, as to when the appropriate time to come back and engage in a further debate with those who have a differing point of view, I am happy to do that.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what this amendment does is it involves two countries--Honduras and Guatemala. As most of my colleagues are aware, in these two countries we were deeply involved for about a decade. And actually conflict went on for some time longer than that where literally thousands of people lost their lives. We as a country were deeply involved in it. There were divisions here in the United States over that level of involvement, that type of involvement. We are not here today to revisit the conflict in Central America of the 1980s. 
There have been pending requests in both of these two situations involving Honduras and Guatemala going back 3 or 4 years, requesting information and documentation involving some very significant and severe human rights violations. 
I identified one earlier involving an American citizen who was raped and brutally tortured in Guatemala. Her case has never been resolved. She would like to have it resolved. Sister Ortiz with the Carmelite Order of Nuns would very much like to get to the bottom of it. I think all of us can understand that if that happened to anyone we knew. As an American citizen, she would like to find out what happened. How do you do that when you are trying to declassify information? 
What this amendment does in both the case of Honduras and Guatemala, there is a request for declassification, which we provide for all the time, but in these particular cases, if the agency, whatever it may be, is unwilling for very important reasons to declassify everything, that there would be an opportunity for a panel--and we have done this before; this is not unprecedented--made up of people from the CIA, the Justice Department, the Department of Defense, the State Department and others, that would review the request and if, in fact, they felt that the request for certain information would violate existing law, methods, resources, procedures, personnel and so forth--then they would deny the request. If they think it is OK, despite the agency's objection--and that is not too big a surprise to us that the agency historically takes the position of being opposed to declassification of any documents; that is not new at all. That has been their reaction. 
As I showed my colleagues, we have blank page after blank page when asking for documentation. That is a request, and we have one entire blank page. You are trying to get to the bottom of a case involving an American citizen or other people where human rights violations occur. This should not be that controversial. I would not ask that just anyone be able to have access to documents or the declassification without going through a process here to determine whether or not any of that information could be harmful to our own country. But it seems to me when a citizen has been hurt, when others who make legitimate requests and don't get to the bottom of information, and we can help by providing information through a declassification process, in two very specific cases here, these two countries, this ought not to be too much to ask. It is not costly; it need not go on long. 
The notion somehow that a non-U.S. citizen may request this information, that somehow this is unprecedented, that is not unprecedented. Many people all over the world request information. It doesn't mean they automatically get it. 
With all due respect to my colleagues, I point out that Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, is a cosponsor of this amendment. We have talked about a number of other cases. Michael DeVine, American citizen, murdered in Guatemala by the Guatemalan military. It was covered up for years. We are trying to get to the bottom of it. 
Is it wrong for American citizens not to be able to request declassification of material that might shed light on who brutalized them or murdered them? We can go through a very legitimate process where we can examine whether or not that information ought to be declassified. If a determination is made that it can be, then we can release it to help get to the bottom of that. The administration has already, by Executive order, said it has no problem with this in terms of getting to a declassification, but we want to have an orderly process. 
This amendment, and I do not claim perfection, this amendment is an effort here to try to do it in an orderly way, to say that you can make your application; that if the respective agency has a problem with a request, there is a way of evaluating whether or not that information ought to be forthcoming, and not just a panel made up of anybody but people who come from the various agencies that I think people would be concerned about. 
I was hoping the amendment would just be agreed to here, that this, again, shouldn't rise to the level of a major concern. In the case of Sister Ortiz, I don't think it is outrageous to make this request. Ambassador Stroock, who was the Ambassador in Guatemala appointed by President Bush, supports this amendment. I am told now by our colleague, Craig Thomas, who spoke on behalf of this amendment, from Wyoming, that he believes, in fact the declassification would help put this matter to rest once and for all. 
My view is people can overreact on these matters here when it comes to this kind of information, but we have heard and know of other cases of American citizens overseas where their lives have been threatened. In the case of Sister Ortiz, a rape and torture. In the case of Michael DeVine, murdered. I don't think it is outrageous for this body to provide a procedure and a mechanism whereby people can find out, through an orderly and proper process of declassification, information that might lead to those who are responsible for it. I hope we would be able to support an amendment that would adopt a process that is orderly and one that will, I hope, assist these people. 
There may not be anything in this information. Some have suggested there is not a lot of information in some of these cases. If that is the case, there is less reason to be opposed to it. In two specific cases here, if there is some information, and it helped to get to the bottom of it, I think we could all have a sense of pride that we contributed to that. 
I urge my colleagues to join Senator Harkin, Senator Mikulski, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Leahy, Senator Jeffords, and myself in adopting this amendment.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me respond to the Senator from Vermont. I thank him for his support on this. In this amendment, we took Public Law 102-526, section VI, entitled `Grounds for Postponement of Public Disclosure of Records.' This is the so-called `Kennedy assassination' language. What I did is I took the exact language--all of the language, which provides the exemptions of where this information should not be provided, and I took the word `assassination' and replaced it with the words `human rights.' Here is an example. Reading from the existing law: 
Disclosure of assassination records and of particular information to the public may be postponed subject to the limitations of the act. 
We write: 
Disclosure of human rights records. 1. Threat of military defense intelligence, conduct, foreign relations, and so forth. Intelligence agents, intelligence sources, and other matters currently related to the military defense. 
All the way down this entire language, all we did is replace the words `human rights' for `assassinations' when it comes to Honduras and Guatemala. We added an additional provision that is not in the Kennedy assassination statute. In addition, the amendment provides that `a document may remain classified if its public disclosure would be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source.' So we even add to it here. 
I say to my colleague from Vermont that we virtually stick to existing law. We provide that if in fact there has been a rejection here by the Agency, then a panel made up of representatives of the Department of Justice, the State Department, Central Intelligence Agency, and Department of Defense can review, over a 30-day period, that request to determine whether or not the sustained declassification is warranted. If they conclude it is not, then it could be declassified so that we can get the information out. Other than that, we follow exactly the Kennedy assassination language, with the exception that we add a provision that is not in the law. 
It even goes further. I always thought it was not a matter of great debate here about whether or not human rights--something we cherish, something we talk about all the time. My Lord, we have provided sanctions on countries all over the world that deprive people of basic human rights. Are we saying, in the case of Honduras and Guatemala where there are huge human rights violations, that we are not going to make an effort to get to the bottom of this, where particularly American citizens' rights were deprived, where they were brutalized? I don't understand that.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wanted to conclude my remarks here. The Kennedy assassination language was a process for declassification. It wasn't necessarily through an application process that we are talking about this amendment. There is a distinction in that regard. 
Secondly, regardless of where a bona fide request comes from for declassification, if it is a bona fide request, whether it is made by a U.S. citizen or a non-U.S. citizen, there is nowhere I know of in there that says somebody is precluded from making the request because they are a non-U.S. citizen, as long as we protect the legitimate source. I point out that most of the other agencies effectively had no difficulty with this. The reason we are requesting this amendment is because we have had a problem with one or two agencies; where they have provided information, it is blank page after blank page, redacted page after redacted page. 
Again, I think on the issue of human rights, certainly we have seen in cases where we wanted to get to the bottom of information involving U.S. citizens, that it is hard enough with some of these countries to get the cooperation in the country themselves to get information. It is a rather ominous thought that a U.S. citizen, or others seeking to get information about why they were murdered or brutalized, that they would face the kind of false obstruction from their own country. 
So, in the case of Honduras and Guatemala, we felt, particularly where these cases involved--particularly the case of Sister Ortiz--an American nun who was raped and tortured in that country, that helping her provide some information to get to the bottom of her case here goes back to 1989--with all of the safeguards included specifically in this amendment is a modest request, indeed, for us to be able to meet. 
I hope when the appropriate motion is made and the yeas and nays are asked on this that my colleagues would support us in adopting this amendment. 
Again, I thank my colleague from Utah for his graciousness.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for 37 years now, the Peace Corps has been promoting international peace and friendship through the service abroad of American volunteers. More than 150,000 Americans from every background have served in the Peace Corps in 132 countries. Right now, more than 6,500 peace Corps Volunteers are living and working alongside local people in 84 countries. 
The Peace Corps is a model of citizen service on international scale and a model of American leadership in the world. In their engagement abroad, American Peace Corps Volunteers share and represent the culture and values of the American people, while living and working alongside local people, and speaking the local language. In doing so, they earn respect and admiration for our country. This is a different type of American Leadership and an important complement to our formal U.S. foreign policy. 
From the day of its establishment, the Peace Corps has seen strong by-partisan support for its programs. I regret that this year the subcommittee has not been able to fund the Peace Corps at the administrations full request. However, I do understand the difficult budgetary constraints facing the subcommittee this year.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Military Construction Subcommittee for their work on this Conference Report. Their efforts are vitally important to this nation's armed forces and the national defense. 
This Conference Report will benefit military bases and military personnel in Connecticut. The Naval Submarine Base in New London, the planned Army Reserve center in West Hartford, and the National Guard Training Center in Niantic each have projects that will be funded when this report becomes law. The total to be spent on these projects will be approximately $14 million. 
The Conference Report funds badly needed pier upgrades at the New London Naval Submarine Base. The piers at the base were originally designed to support SSN 637-class submarines, half of which have been decommissioned. The requirements of contemporary submarines have overwhelmed these piers. Power outages on the piers occur, on average, 80 times per year, and the cranes that resupply the submarines outweigh the piers' design capacity. This project affects military readiness, quality of life and the safety of our personnel. 
The report also includes $1.49 million to take the first step to replace an overwhelmed Army Reserve Center building and free the government of a $100,000 per month lease. Moreover, these funds will begin a much needed expansion that will enhance the training and readiness of eight Army Reserve units. 
Finally, the report will fund the planning and design of a new National Guard training center in Niantic, Connecticut. The present facility consists of World War II vintage, temporary wooden structures. They do not meet Army standards for classrooms, dining, or billeting. The National Guard, however, relies on this training center to serve troops from six Northeastern states. Troops of all ranks train at the center, and the Army and the Army Reserve use the center as well. The funding of the planning and design of the new center is a welcome sign to thousands of servicemembers, for it signals a strong commitment from the federal government to the National Guard. 
One Connecticut project would have replaced an Air National Guard complex in Orange. The poor condition of the present facility severely hinders the 103rd Air Control Squadron from accomplishing its mission, and the structure suffers from a variety of building code violations. I thank my colleagues on the Military Construction Subcommittee for including this project in the Senate bill. The project was not funded in conference, but I still appreciate the support of Chairman Burns and Senator Murray, and I look forward to working with them next year to fund this project in Fiscal Year 2000. 
So, I praise the Conference Committee for their work on this report. They have made some tough choices--this report allocates $759 million less than last year. But they have made those choices with the best interests of the U.S. armed forces in mind.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as we consider the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill today, many of my colleagues may think that by reviewing the provisions of the bill with respect to funding for International Military Education and Training (IMET) they will have a full picture of the total U.S. spending for the training of foreign military personnel that is proposed for fiscal year 1999. Based on that review, they might conclude that the Administration will spend approximately $50 million for training of military personnel from some 113 countries, or roughly the same as has been spent on IMET during the current fiscal year. However, that conclusion would not be accurate. 
While it is true that the Congress gets a very detailed accounting of the nature and level of IMET spending annually, a recent series of articles that appeared in the Washington Post revealed that a great deal more training of foreign military personnel was ongoing totally outside the framework of IMET programs. 
The fact of the matter is that training of foreign military personnel is now being undertaken using funds from a variety of other accounts under the control of the State Department or the Defense Department. Some of these accounts have no reporting requirements associated with them and therefore little or no Congressional oversight is possible. 
What is even more significant, is that more foreign military personnel may be being trained outside of the traditional framework of IMET programs than is within such programs. I do know for example that during Fiscal Year 1997 IMET funds were used to train approximately 192 Mexican Military Personnel--a modest number. During that same time period, so called Section 1004 authorized funds, paid for out of the Fiscal 1997 Defense Appropriations Act, were used to train some 829 Mexican military personnel--roughly four times as many individuals as were trained under the auspices of IMET. 
Mr. President, I am one who believes that United States National interests can be served by U.S. training foreign military personnel on the appropriate roles for national militaries in civil society. However, I also believe that certain kinds of training are inappropriate for military institutions that may have poor track records with respect to respecting the human rights of their own citizens. It is imperative that the Department of Defense and State work closely together to ensure that the United States is conveying a consistent message with respect to United States policy as it undertakes various programs with foreign military leaders. I do not believe that currently enough consultation takes place in this regard. 
At the moment, there is no single office or report that one can turn to obtain a comprehensive overview of the training that is ongoing abroad. It is for that reason that I have offered the pending amendment, which requires a detailed report on this issue. The amendment requires the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State to jointly provide to the Congress by January 31, 1999, a report on all overseas military training of foreign military personnel under programs administered by the Department of Defense and the Department of State during fiscal years 1998 and 1999, including those proposed for fiscal year 1999. 
Specifically, the report would include the following for each such military training activity: a foreign policy justification and purpose for the activity; location and cost; the number of foreign students trained and their units of operation. The report would also identify the United States military units involved in the activities and an explanation of the benefits to United States personnel derived from each such training activity. If deemed necessary and appropriate, the report may include a classified annex. 
If Congress is going to be able to carry out responsible oversight to taxpayer funded programs, such a report is vital. I also believe that such a report will be beneficial to Executive Branch officials and civilian government authorities in the countries where training is ongoing. 
It is my understanding that the Administration has no opposition to this amendment. I urge its adoption.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation, along with my distinguished colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett, to help alleviate a serious shortage of students graduating from our nation's colleges and universities with technology-based education and skills. 
Technology is reshaping our world at a rapid pace. Competition to meet the needs, wants, and expectations of consumers has accelerated the rate of technological progress to a level inconceivable even just a few decades ago. Today, technology is playing an increasingly important role in the lives of every American and is a key ingredient to sustaining America's economic growth. It is the wellspring from which new businesses, high-wage jobs, and a rising quality of life will flow in the 21st century. 
Today, we are fortunate that our economy is strong. We have created more than 16 million new jobs since 1993. We have the lowest unemployment in 28 years, the smallest welfare rolls in 27 years, and the lowest inflation in 32 years. If we want to build on this progress, we must encourage our people to develop and use emerging technologies. 
Technological progress is the single most important determining factor in sustaining growth in our economy. It is estimated that technological innovation has accounted for as much as half the nation's long-term economic growth over the past 50 years and is expected to account for an even higher percentage in the next 50 years. 
And yet, there is mounting evidence that we are not doing enough to help our people make the most of technological change. Our businesses are practically desperate for workers with skills in computers and other technologically advanced systems. More than 350,000 information technology positions are currently unfilled throughout the United States. The number of students graduating from colleges with computer science degrees has declined dramatically. In my home state of Connecticut, public and private colleges combined produced only 299 computer science graduates in 1997, a 50 percent decline from 1987. We are not alone. Nationwide, the number of graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer science dropped 43 percent between 1986 and 1994. 
The Department of Commerce estimates that 1.3 million new jobs will be created over the next decade for systems analysts, computer engineers and computer scientists. Yet, at a time when our nation is struggling to fill these positions, our colleges are graduating fewer skilled information technology students. 
At large and mid-sized companies there is one vacancy for every 10 information technology jobs, and eight out of 10 companies expect to hire information technology workers in the year ahead. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, this trend will only continue through 2006. 
This shortage of skilled and knowledgeable workers is perhaps the most significant threat to our continued economic expansion. Clearly, we must do more as a country to eliminate this shortage. 
We need to turn our attention to our work force and focus on it as a critical part of our economic development. We must put more emphasis on human capital, and we need to educate more students in the diverse areas of technology. 
In Connecticut, many businesses are taking initiatives to do so. They are establishing scholarships, donating lab equipment, planning curricula, and sending employees into schools to instruct and help prepare students for technology-based jobs. 
One Connecticut company, The Pfizer Corporation, recently announced that it will spend $19 million to build an animal vaccine research laboratory at The University of Connecticut. This partnership will not only lead to advancements in gene technology and animal health, but it will also promote joint research projects in which company scientists will work alongside professors and students. 
Another example in Connecticut is the support provided to the biotechnology program at Middlesex Community-Technical College by The Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute and the CuraGen Corporation. These companies have established scholarships, donated lab equipment, and encouraged their research scientists to give lectures to the students. 
And yet, Mr. President, businesses and academic institutions shouldn't have to tackle alone the challenge of helping students obtain the learning and skills they need to succeed in the coming century. The federal government can and should work with our technology-based businesses and places of learning to encourage innovation and education that will create jobs and prosperity for our people. 
That is why I am pleased to introduce legislation today that will encourage businesses to work in and with educational institutions in order to improve technology-based learning--so that more of our students will be able to win the best jobs of the 21st century economy. 
This bill will give a tax credit to any business that goes into a university, college, or community-technical school and engages in technology-based educational activities which are directly related to the business of that company. 
Businesses could claim a tax credit for 40 percent of these educational expenses, up to a maximum of $100,000 for any one company. 
It is my hope, Mr. President, that this tax credit will provide the incentive for more of our nation's companies to play an active role in the education, training, and skill development of our nation's most valuable resource--its students. 
If businesses take advantage of this credit, not only will they have a larger pool of skilled workers to draw from, but our nation will have a better-educated population that possesses the knowledge to succeed in the information-based economy of the future.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee--Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, respectively--for finishing work on this appropriations bill. Every year their Subcommittee does the vitally important work of balancing the multitude of priorities that make up this nation's defense. Their work becomes more important every year as our nation leaves behind the more predictable Cold War era. 
I am pleased that this bill contains full funding for the second New Attack Submarine. This highly capable and relatively inexpensive class of submarines will take a lead role in the defense of this nation well into the 21st century. This submarine is exactly the type of military asset that we will rely on in the years to come. It is multi-mission capable, it will make use of new technology as it develops, and it will be able to remain on station at all corners of the earth. 
This bill also provides for the helicopter needs of the Army and the National Guard. Both the Blackhawk and the Comanche helicopter programs achieved significant increases beyond the President's request. This year, strong Congressional support brought the number of Blackhawk-type helicopters from the 22 requested by the Administration to 34. I hope that as the Administration develops the Fiscal Year 2000 defense budget, it will take into account the fact that the Army, Navy, and National Guard need these helicopters sooner rather than later. We need 36 helicopters per year to fulfill requirements expeditiously and to trigger the savings that would come from a purchase of that size. The Comanche helicopter, still in development, enjoys a similar level of Congressional support that is matched only by the support it enjoys at the Pentagon. This bill's support for the Comanche is reassuring. 
I am particularly pleased that two amendments that I offered to this bill were accepted. The first will expand the Defense Department's programs aimed at monitoring and researching Lyme Disease. The disease is a serious problem in the Northeast and is listed by the Defense Department as a militarily significant disease for troops stationed within the United States and deployed worldwide. The sooner we confront this disease with the necessary resources, the sooner the Defense Department and this nation will be able to avoid the significant losses from this terrible disease. 
Also, I am glad that the Senate included my amendment that will eliminate the delay in processing Army pensions. All military retirees are due a pension and medical benefits beginning at age 60. My amendment will ensure that pensioners receive their payments and benefits on time. Mr. Arthur Greenberg, of Hamden, Connecticut, first brought this problem to my attention several weeks ago. He wrote a letter to me and stated that the Army had told him that he would not receive his pension or medical benefits until nine months after his 60th birthday. To my surprise, Mr. Greenberg's case was not an isolated incident. The Army told me that 40% of its caseload was backlogged. This is absolutely unsatisfactory, and that is why I put this amendment forward. This amendment directs the Secretary of the Army to eliminate the backlog by the end of this calendar year and to submit a report to Congress on the matter. I fully expect that those who put their lives at risk to defend this nation will soon begin to receive their pensions and benefits, as expected, on their 60th birthday. 
In sum, this bill is a responsible effort to provide for the national defense for Fiscal Year 1999. The New Attack Submarine, Comanche and Blackhawk helicopters, F-22 and F/A-18 fighters, C-17 cargo aircraft, and the many other assets that this bill funds are vitally important to protecting our way of life and our interests throughout the world. As usual, the men and women in my home state of Connecticut, whether they serve in the military or in the defense industry, will play important roles with respect to this bill. Overall, I support this bill, and I am glad that this body has nearly unanimously agreed on it.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute a good friend to me and my family, and a pillar of the Connecticut legal and political community: Leo Flaherty of Vernon, Connecticut. Sadly, Mr. Flaherty recently died at the age of 75. 
Leo Flaherty was Vernon's elder statesman. For years, young attorneys and political aspirants in town have looked to Leo Flaherty as a role model and for his advice and leadership. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity as a lawyer, his instincts as a politician, and, in general, his strong moral character. 
While remembered as possessing a great legal mind, Leo's intelligence was not limited to any one discipline. In 1942, he left Connecticut to attend Georgia Tech. A year later he received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy, where he was a classmate of President Jimmy Carter. After graduating from the Academy, he earned a degree in engineering from the University of Connecticut, and he worked at both Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Standard. 
But despite his ventures into engineering, there was always something drawing him to politics. It was in his blood. His father, Leo, Sr. served as a Rockville city alderman and Democratic Town Committee Chairman--a position that Leo, Jr. held for 10 years. 
He held several positions in Rockville from tax collector to a member of the State Board of Education. In 1960, he became Rockville's mayor. The most significant accomplishment of his tenure in the mayor's office was managing the consolidation of Rockville with the neighboring, more rural town of Vernon. This was a controversial proposal, but Rockville had one of the worst urban poverty rates in the state, and he saw the merger of the two cities as key to Rockville's future prosperity. 
The Rockville mayor's job was eliminated upon completion of the merger. So, in the end, Leo Flaherty worked himself out of a job. But Leo Flaherty never regretted his actions because he knew that this was the right thing to do, not for him, but for his community. 
The final political office that he ever held was chairman of Connecticut's members of the Electoral College, which chooses the President. True to form and his principles, his first act in this position was to call for the elimination of the college. He always believed that the popular vote should prevail. 
His tenure as an attorney lasted even longer than his political career. Leo Flaherty earned a reputation as a lawyer who would help anyone. Oftentimes he found himself representing some of society's undesirables, but he never wavered in his belief that every individual, rich or poor, had certain rights and was entitled to effective legal representation. He never sought the high powered clients, and he never became a millionaire. But, as was said after his passing, Leo Flaherty died a rich man because he owned his soul. 
In a 1996 interview, Leo Flaherty said that he had no intention of retiring unless he had to. This prophecy was fulfilled. He worked until his body would no longer allow it, as he contracted Lou Gehrig's disease--a terminal degenerative nerve condition. 
Leo Flaherty was a man whom I looked up to with the highest respect and admiration. He will be dearly missed.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, our nation's struggle against the AIDS virus has been a difficult one. More and more Americans are beginning to learn the facts about this disease that has become the leading killer of U.S. adults between the ages of 25 and 44. And in recent years, we have finally begun to devote significant resources toward quality treatment and the search for a cure. But as my colleagues know, for many years, attention to the disease was severely lacking, and only a handful of people in this country were actively working for better treatment of its victims. I am proud to say that one of the true heroes and pioneers in the fight against AIDS hails from Connecticut: Catherine Kennedy of New Haven. Sadly, Mrs. Kennedy recently died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 51. 
Catherine Kennedy was active on many fronts in the fight against AIDS, but she is best known for her efforts to establish Connecticut's first nursing home for people afflicted with this disease. 
A native of England, Catherine Kennedy moved to New Haven in 1983. Shortly after moving to Connecticut, she noticed the lack of nursing centers and services for people in the area living with AIDS. She saw nursing homes that were refusing care to many individuals. Patients were being kept, at enormous expense, at hospitals that were essentially unequipped to treat them. And other patients were in fact homeless. 
Catherine Kennedy took it upon herself to create a nursing home designed specifically to treat persons living with HIV/AIDS who were too sick to stay at home but too healthy to need hospital care. Her efforts were met with great resistance along the way. 
But she eventually gained the help of Lucie McKinney, the widow of U.S. Representative Stewart McKinney, who had died of AIDS. Together they were able to convince the Governor and state legislature to support the idea of a treatment center, and a law was passed which provided funding to cover non-hospital care costs for AIDS patients and to convert an old factory in New Haven into a nursing home. She was also able to secure a grant from Yale-New Haven Hospital to help finance the home. 
In 1995, eight years after Catherine Kennedy began her efforts to establish this center, Leeway, Inc. opened its doors and became the first nursing home in Connecticut for the treatment of persons with AIDS or the HIV virus. Since it opened, Leeway has treated more than 150 individuals. And while Catherine Kennedy's original idea was to create a center to primarily provide quality care for dying patients, today nearly half of their patients are able to go home and resume their everyday lives. 
Catherine Kennedy is a shining example of what one person can accomplish if they are willing to fully commit themselves to the betterment of their community. She overcame tremendous resistance and even greater odds to open this nursing home. Her determination has resulted in a better life for hundreds of people living with HIV/AIDS in Connecticut, as well as in communities all across the country who look at Leeway as a model for providing quality care. 
But Catherine Kennedy touched the lives of many more people than just those who struggle with this deadly disease. She was a beloved figure by all who knew her, and she inspired those around her to ask more of themselves and reach out to others in need. She will be dearly missed. 
She is survived by her husband Paul, her three sons, two brothers and two sisters. I offer my heartfelt condolences to them all.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the most passionate and committed political leaders that this country has ever known: Paul O'Dwyer of New York City. Sadly, Mr. O'Dwyer recently died, one day before his 91st birthday. 
A former New York City Council President, Paul O'Dwyer was the soul of political activism in New York for a half-century. 
Author Frank McCourt mourned him as `one of the pure souls' who `developed convictions early in life and never wavered.' And not only did Paul O'Dwyer hold deep convictions, he also acted on them. Mr. O'Dwyer once said, `Politics is the only machinery around on which you can really straighten things out.' And hardly a day went by, where Paul O'Dwyer didn't work to `straighten things out' for the people of our country and our world who were most in need. 
He was the quintessential champion of the underdog, and his thick white mane of hair became the symbol of most every significant social movement in New York during the past 50 years. 
The causes he championed were as diverse as the people and places of our great nation, but at the soul of each of his endeavors was the pursuit of social justice. 
He immigrated to the United States from Ireland when he was 17, and he worked his entire adult life for a united Ireland. He was the national coordinator for the American League for an Undivided Ireland. He worked very closely with Gerry Adams and fought for his historic trip to the United States so he could plead his case for peace and understanding in his homeland. And he insisted on meeting with Protestant leaders who visited our shores. 
He fought diligently for the creation of the State of Israel. As chairman of the Lawyer's Committee for Justice in Palestine, he pleaded at the United Nations in the late 1940s for Israeli sovereignty. 
He was deeply committed to ending segregation in our country. He successfully litigated a critical desegregation suit in 1951, which opened the way for blacks to live in Stuyvesant Town, a large Manhattan housing complex. He also went to the Deep South to register African-American voters, campaign for black candidates, and provide legal assistance. 
He successfully argued before the Supreme Court for the right of mainland Puerto Ricans to take their voter literacy test in Spanish. 
His constant support of minority causes helped deny him a mainstream role in American politics. In all his efforts to win elective public office, he succeeded just twice, once as Manhattan's councilman at large and the other time as New York City Council President. He also won the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator in 1968, but lost the general election to Senator Jacob Javits. But Paul O'Dwyer didn't enter politics to win elections, he did so because he saw injustice in this country, and he was determined to eradicate it. 
In the end, Paul O'Dwyer may have lost more elections than he won, but his leadership was not based on titles. It was built on principles. 
Perhaps that is why few individuals have ever earned the level of respect and admiration that Paul O'Dwyer received from both his colleagues and his adversaries. 
Paul O'Dwyer was truly one of a kind, and he will be dearly missed for his leadership and more importantly for his friendship.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Robert Bennett, the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, to introduce, at the request of the President of the United States, `The Year 2000 Information Disclosure Act.' We are joined in this introduction by Senators Moynihan, Kohl, and Robb. 
It should be clear to even the most disinterested observer that we are facing a serious economic challenge in form of the Year 2000 computer problem. There is little doubt that the millennium conversion will have a significant impact on the economy; the outstanding question is how large that impact will be. 
One of the most relevant factors in assessing the potential impact of this problem is the expected readiness of small and medium sized businesses to deal with this issue. Many of the nation's largest corporations are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to prepare for Year 2000 conversion: Citibank is spending $600 million, Aetna is spending more than $125 million, and the list goes on and on. However, it is not so clear that small and medium sized businesses are approaching the problem with similar vigor. 
As a result, it is my opinion that it will become increasingly necessary for those companies that have successfully completed remediation and are now testing to able to share those results with other companies that might not be as far along. It will be an increasing national economic priority to use all the tools available to help businesses and government entities meet the millennium deadline, and encouraging the sharing of information that can cut precious weeks off the time it takes to get ready will be essential. 
I agree with the statements of President Clinton that companies that make such voluntary disclosures should not be punished for those disclosures with frivolous or abusive lawsuits. It is to address that concern that the President has requested that Senator Bennett and I introduce his legislation. 
I also agree with the President's analysis that in order for this information-sharing to be effective, it must start to take place as soon as possible. Sharing information about non-compliant systems six, eight, or twelve months from now will be of limited value to all concerned. 
Some questions have emerged in the press as to the scope of this legislation. The fact is that there are very few weeks left in this session, and therefore the broader the bill, the more difficult it will be to pass. Therefore, if we are intent on providing protection for voluntary disclosures on Year 2000, it will be very hard to add to that provisions dealing with other aspects of Year 2000 liability. While I believe that concerns on underlying liability are real and meaningful, there is little question that dealing with any liability issues is always a controversial and lengthy process. So as we move forward with the concept of a safe harbor for voluntary disclosure, I hope that we can do so without encumbering that legislation with these larger and contentious issues regarding liability. 
President Clinton has given us an excellent starting point for discussing these important issues. I look forward to working with all my colleagues in the weeks remaining to craft final legislation that addresses these issues in a meaningful and constructive manner.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in support of the Workforce Investment Act Conference Report. This is a truly bipartisan bill. As a conferee, I would like to commend Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, DeWine, and Wellstone, as well as the House conferees, for shepherding this bill through the conference. 
Few issues that we vote on in Congress are as important to the future of this country as the lifelong education and training of our workforce. We live in an era of a global economy, emerging industries and company downsizing. It is imperative that our delivery of services meets the employment and educational needs of the 21st century. 
The current maze of more than 160 programs which are administered by 15 separate federal agencies has failed. The Workforce Investment Act streamlines these programs by giving more authority to state and local representatives of government, business, labor, education, and youth activities. The bill establishes a true collaborative process between the state and local representatives to ensure that training and educational services will be held to high standards. This bill also gives more flexibility to individuals seeking training assistance. Individuals will no longer be limited to a predetermined set of services. 
I am especially pleased that the cornerstone of the Workforce Investment Act is streamlined service delivery through one-stop career centers. My state of Connecticut is nearing completion of implementation of its one-stop system, called Conneticut Works. This network has reformed the delivery of job training services in the state. I have had the privilege of visiting many of these centers and can attest to their success. 
While I applaud the new system of providing training assistance incorporated in ths bill, I am pleased that the bill retains some direct federal involvement in order to ensure that disadvantaged youth, veterans and displaced workers receive the training assistance and support they need. 
For many years, the Connecticut economy was dependent on defense-oriented industries. The Workforce Investment Act ensures that employees who are adversely affected by base closures and military downsizing will have access to job training and supportive services in order to acquire the skills needed for employment in the technology-driven economy of the 21st century. 
This legislation also provides for the coordination of adult education systems, allowing adult education to play a crucial role in a participant's professional training program. In the area of adult education and literacy, this legislation specifically targets those communities that demonstrate significant illiteracy rates to receive adult education programs as a first priority. I am pleased that this legislation also includes a provision that will direct funds designated to support English as a Second Language (ESL) programs to those ESL programs in communities with designated need. This means that ESL programs with waiting lists--those in communities 
with the greatest need for the valuable services these programs provide--will receive funds on a prioritized basis. 
Mr. President, in order to better assist nonnative English speakers and fully assimilate them into our society, we must help them become more fluent in English. I can think of few more important factors in determining whether or not someone new to this society will successfully make this difficult transition than their ability to speak English. 
A clear and effective grasp of the English language is still the best indicator of success for nonnative English speakers. The ability to speak English for anyone in today's marketplace represents an `open door,' Mr. President. This `open door' can lead to greater employment and advancement opportunities for those whose first language is not English. 
Additionally, Mr. President, this legislation reauthorizes the Rehabilitation Act. This critically important legislation provides comprehensive vocational rehabilitation services designed to help individuals with disabilities become more employable and achieve greater independence and integration into society. 
Under the Rehabilitation Act, states, with assistance provided by the federal government in the manner of formula-derived grants, provide a broad array of services to individuals with disabilities that includes assessment, counseling, vocational and other educational services, work related placement services, and rehabilitation technology services. More than 1.25 million Americans with disabilities were served by vocational rehabilitation programs in 1995 alone, Mr. President. 
I am particularly pleased that a provision dealing with assistive technology was included in this legislation. This provision, Section 508, will require the federal government to provide assistive technology to Federal employees with disabilities. This provision will put into place for the first time regulations requiring the federal government to provide its employees with disabilities access to appropriate technology suited to their individual needs. 
This legislation would allow the federal government to take the lead in providing critical access to information technology to all federal employees with disabilities in this country. It strengthens the federal requirement that electronic and information technology purchased by federal agencies be accessible to their employees with disabilities. 
Electronic and information technology accessibility is essential for federal employees to maintain a meaningful employment experience, as well as to meet their full potential. We live in a world where information and technology are synonymous with professional advancement. Increasingly, essential job functions have come to involve the use of technology, and where it is inaccessible, job opportunities that others take for granted are foreclosed to people with disabilities. 
Presently, there are approximately 145,000 individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce. Roughly 61 percent of these employees hold permanent positions in professional, administrative, or technical occupations. Nationally, there are 49 million Americans who have disabilities, nearly half of them have a severe disability. Yet most mass market information technology is designed without consideration for their needs. 
Section 508, Mr. President, is the first step in an effort to ensure that all individuals with disabilities have access to the assistive technology providing them the ability to reach their full capability. Though Section 508 will presently only affect federal employees, it is my hope that one day all individuals with disabilities will have the same access to assistive technology now afforded federal employees because of this important legislation. The federal government must truly be an equal opportunity employer, and this equal opportunity must apply fully to individuals with special needs. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would again like to commend Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Kennedy, and Wellstone, as well as Chairman Goodling, Congressmen Clay, Kildee, and Martinez for the important role they each played in making this conference agreement a reality. They all worked closely with myself and my staff to address numerous concerns and for that I would like to thank them.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to join my colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords and my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Mary Landrieu, in cosponsoring an amendment to require federal child care facilities to lead by example when it comes to child care quality. 
Up to this point Mr. President, we in the federal government have not shown strong leadership when it comes to child care quality. 
Many parents of children in federal child care facilities have been surprised to discover that these facilities are exempt from the state and local quality standards that apply to non-federal centers. Many parents have been surprised to find that the federal government does not require its centers to be accredited. 
With this amendment, for the first time, the more than 200 federal, non-military, child care centers would be required to meet all state licensing standards. For the first time, these centers would be required to demonstrate that they provide high quality child care by becoming accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body. 
Child care shouldn't be like going to Las Vegas--where you roll the dice and hope for the best. Parents should be confident that when they are not able to be with their children, their children will still be well cared for. We shouldn't be gambling with our children's health and safety. 
This legislation will go a long way toward giving parents of children in federal facilities peace of mind. 
I should point out, Mr. President, that many of the child centers run by the federal government provide an invaluable service and excellent care to the children of federal workers and other families in the community. Many federal centers have even received accreditation from the National Association for the Education of Young Children--an outstanding private, non-profit accrediting entity. 
But this excellence is not uniform. In some federal agencies, only a minority of child care centers are accredited. Too many centers are falling through the cracks. And too many children are unnecessarily being placed at risk. 
Mr. President, at a time when we are asking our states and communities to take notice of the important research about brain development in young children--at a time when we all acknowledge how critical high quality child care is to helping children achieve their potential--shouldn't we, as federal government lead the way when it comes to providing the best care possible for our children? 
Mr. President, this legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support. It was incorporated into the CIDCARE bill that I co-sponsored with Senator Jeffords and was a part of the Child Care ACCESS Act that I offered with 27 of my Democratic colleagues earlier this year. 
This is an important step in improving the quality of our Nation's child care. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my views on providing tax relief for working families, and more specifically about the marriage penalty. I have always supported efforts to alleviate the tax burden felt by many of our nation's working families. In 1993, I supported tax cuts for millions of working families making less than $30,000 per year through an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit. And again, last year, I supported tax cuts targeted toward working families, including the $500 per-child-tax credit, the $1,500 HOPE education tax credit, reinstatement of student loan deductions, full deductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-employed and capital gains and estate tax relief, I was pleased to support these tax cuts, Mr. President, because each was carefully targeted, fully paid for, and consistent with a balanced budget. 
Today, I continue to support efforts to bring relief to working families, including providing them with substantial relief from the marriage penalty. Yet, despite my support for repealing the marriage penalty which affects more than 20 million American families, I felt compelled to vote against the amendment offered by Senator Brownback, because in my view, the amendment did not provide targeted relief to those who need it most. In fact, Senator Brownback's amendment would offer marriage penalty relief to only about 40 percent of those currently penalized. Moreover, this amendment was both a costly measure--costing $125 billion over five years and $300 billion over the next ten years--and one that was not paid for. 
Mr. President, because Senator Brownback's amendment was not offset, it would have significantly drained the Treasury and put an incredible strain on the Social Security trust fund. Indeed, had this amendment been adopted without an offset as proposed, we would be forced to make draconian across-the-board spending cuts to all discretionary spending, including many important programs like Head Start, public health programs, and defense. In addition, this amendment threatened to use as its offset, funds from the Social Security reserves, which clearly would jeopardize the solvency of and undermine the strength of the Social Security trust fund. Mr. President, in my view, we could ill afford to pay for this amendment with either option, and that is why I, in good conscience, could not support this amendment. 
I want to be clear, however, that I support efforts to repeal the marriage penalty. Yet I remain committed to doing so in a way that does not harm the progress we've made in balancing the budget and in a way that targets relief to working families who need it most. That is why I was pleased to support the Democratic alternative, which would have reduced the marriage penalty in the tax code for approximately 90 percent of the families currently penalized. Indeed, this amendment was carefully targeted and would cut the marriage tax penalty more for a greater number of families Furthermore, this proposal would have cost far less than Senator Brownback's proposal--$7 billion over five years and $21 billion over the next ten years. And finally, the Democratic alternative was fully offset without using reserves from the Social Security trust fund, but rather by using a number of widely supported proposals from the President's budget. 
Although I was disappointed that the Democratic alternative was defeated, I remain hopeful that Congress will continue to work to repeal the marriage penalty in a way that is both fiscally responsible and carefully targeted to the American families who need relief the most.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to waive the 1920 Merchant Marine Act, commonly known as the Jones Act, to allow Coastal Cruisers, LLC to operate the 1983 Singapore-built vessel Amici. 
Coastal Cruisers, LLC is a family-owned business in Branford, Connecticut that wishes to offer charters of Long Island Sound, Block Island Sound, and the Thimble Islands, among other destinations in the United States. The Amici is equipped to carry only up to six people and, therefore, does not pose any threat to larger U.S. shipping interests. 
Prior to the Amici's purchase, the owners secured counsel to purchase the vessel and to establish the corporation Coastal Cruisers, LLC. They were aware that the vessel was foreign-built, although they had no knowledge of the Jones Act's restrictions on foreign-built vessels sailing between U.S. ports. Much to the owners' dismay, they were informed by the Coast Guard that their services would be in violation of the Jones Act only after they had applied for a vessel documentation. 
Coastal Cruisers, LLC clearly presented its intentions to use the boat for cruising purposes to several parties involved in its acquisition, including the insurance company from which it was purchased and the seller, who himself is a captain with an unrestricted operating license. These parties failed to inform Coastal Cruisers, LLC about the Jones Act and the restrictions it would face in its endeavor. Coastal Cruisers, LLC never willfully intended to violate the Jones Act, a law about which it possessed no knowledge. Based upon these facts, Mr. President, I believe a waiver should be granted.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I join other colleagues of ours who today, and I hope tomorrow as well, will find time to express their deep sense of sorrow over the loss of two of our Capitol Hill police officers last Friday, as well as to express their sincere condolences to the families and friends of these two very fine officers, J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson. 
The events of last Friday, July 24, certainly will leave an indelible mark on this community--this Capitol community, if you will--and our Nation. The tragic legacy of this incident will not only be the courage displayed opposing this senseless act of savagery but will also be the premature loss of these two fine, brave men. 
J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson were not just courageous officers, they were fine human beings. They were friends of many here and in the House of Representatives. All of us in this Chamber cannot help but take this loss personally, because Officers Chestnut and Gibson worked every day to ensure the safety of each and every one of us in this Capitol Building. I think that every American should look into their hearts and thank these two men for their sacrifices, because they also worked to protect all of those who visit this great Capitol Building, this symbol of democracy, as well as the freedoms which the Capitol represents. 
All Americans should give thanks and say a prayer for these two fine men and all of the men and women in uniform throughout our Nation who take that oath to ensure our safety every day. Our police officers are husbands, they are parents and friends, they are neighbors--in many ways, ordinary citizens just like the rest of us. But in one very important way, these individuals are quite extraordinary. Every day when they put on their uniforms, their work clothes, and they say goodbye to their families and go to work, they literally put their lives on the line so that we may enjoy the safety and the freedoms that too often, I think, we take for granted. We describe their actions as heroism, but they simply view them as their duty. 
President John Kennedy once said: 
The courage of life is often a less dramatic spectacle than the courage of a final moment; but it is no less a magnificent mixture of triumph and tragedy. A man does what he must--in spite of the personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures--and that is the basis of all morality. 
While we will forever remember Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson for their actions on July 24, they deserve our respect and admiration not only for the way they performed their duties on that day but for the way they and those who share a similar uniform carry themselves every day throughout their lives--always working in the service of others, with great courage and character. 
It is important that we remember not only those who gave their lives but also express our gratitude to those who are left to carry on their mission. 
Officers Chestnut and Gibson's colleagues must put these events behind them and carry on with their everyday lives and continue performing the services that are so important. We are all very grateful for the sacrifices they make every day and the commitment to their communities that these men and women display. 
It has been ordered that their bodies will lie in state in the Capitol rotunda tomorrow, the same Capitol where they gave their lives in service to their country. This honor is usually reserved for our Nation's most prominent leaders, Presidents, Supreme Court Justices, and Generals. But I know all of us in this Chamber feel that this is an appropriate tribute to the two men whose commitment to their country and their community is surpassed by none. 
J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson leave behind loving wives and children. I offer my heartfelt condolences to both families and their friends, and, on behalf of this body, I know I speak for all of our colleagues in saying they will long be remembered for their friendship and their courage.

Mr. DODD. Madam President, I would like to address the Shelby amendment, which is before this body, and also make reference to the amendment offered by my good friend and colleague from Nebraska, Senator Hagel. 
I rise in opposition to the Shelby amendment. The Shelby amendment would exempt, as we all know now, banks of less than $250 million in assets from the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act. 
As I stated before when we were debating this issue on Friday, I disagree with the substance of this amendment, but before I turn to the substance, let me suggest what I know the chairman of the Banking Committee and the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, have said over and over again with regard to this amendment, and that is, to those who might be inclined to support this amendment, the adoption of this amendment will result in the collapse of the credit union bill. That is a fact. A vote for it will certainly achieve that result. 
The amendment offered by Senator Shelby goes outside the issues at play in the credit union bill and seeks, in a very controversial manner, to reduce the responsibilities of banks to their communities. 
As a number of my colleagues have noted previously, the administration has already stated very emphatically that it will veto any legislation that has this CRA exemption contained within it. Let there be no mistake, a vote in favor of the Shelby amendment is a vote against the credit union legislation. 
Let me briefly address a few of the issues that surround this amendment. 
The supporters of this amendment make two seemingly powerful arguments in its favor. The first argument they make is that the CRA creates a regulatory burden so onerous that the imposition of it on community banks places them at a disadvantage versus the credit unions against whom the banks must compete. 
The second argument offered by those who support this amendment is that this amendment, the Community Reinvestment Act itself, forces banks to make unprofitable loans and thus constitutes Government interference of the worst kind. 
Neither of these amendments bears up against careful scrutiny. 
First, with respect to regulatory burden, the bank regulators, under the leadership of the Comptroller of the Currency, significantly reduced the regulatory burden on banks when the new CRA enforcement rules went into effect on January 1, 1996. 
At that time, the new rules received extensive breaks from bankers, large and small, as being workable. Richard Mount stated, on behalf of the Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents only small community banks: 
The new rules should alleviate the paperwork nightmare of CRA for community banks and allow them to concentrate on what they do best--reinvest in their communities. 
Given the changes made in 1996, there is little reason to believe that a CRA exemption for small banks would result in reduced costs sufficient enough to make a difference in their competition with credit unions. 
What is perhaps more important, Madam President, is the question of whether CRA actually is a means for the Government to engage in credit allocation and whether CRA forces banks to make unprofitable loans. Again, I do not think the facts bear out these statements. 
Some have suggested that the Community Reinvestment Act was enacted in 1977 solely because banks enjoyed a protected advantage in communities, that CRA was the tradeoff for continuing those protective statutes. These people argued that with the advent of increased financial competition, and particularly with the passage by Congress of the Interstate Banking and Branching Act that ended the exclusive rights of banks to service particular communities, the basis for CRA no longer exists. 
While those were important factors in the passage of CRA, the overriding concern, Madam President, was that the banking industry, which enjoyed then and enjoys today the benefit of taxpayer-backed deposit insurance, was using that benefit to make loans available only to affluent communities, and were allowing less affluent communities, from Appalachia to Bridgeport, CT, to wither on the vine. 
The hearing record in 1977 clearly shows that by most surveys banks were returning only pennies in loans for every dollar of deposit that came from low- and moderate-income areas. The solution to that real and uncontested problem was that regulators take steps to ensure that banks serve their entire communities, not just select parts. 
However, there is nothing in CRA that allows the regulators to have the banks waive basic fundamental underwriting practices. The regulators cannot permit the banks to jeopardize safety and soundness in order to demonstrate compliance with the act. 
In other words, Madam President, CRA loans have to make money. They must make money. As bank regulators stated in their joint agency rule on CRA:  
The agencies firmly believe that institutions can and should expect lending and investments encouraged by CRA to be profitable. . . . As in other areas of bank and thrift operations, unsafe and unsound practices are viewed unfavorably. 
Or as Mario Antoci, chairman of the American Savings said: 
Lending in the inner city has turned out to be the most profitable part of our business over the past few years. 
Madam President, the Community Reinvestment Act has proven, I think, to be one of the most useful financial initiatives enacted by the Federal Government in a generation. 
Community groups estimate that CRA has brought more than $1 trillion into underserved communities across our Nation from our small rural towns to our largest cities. It is done so in a manner that not only benefits the community in which the investment is made, but also allows the lending institution to expect the same profit that they would receive on other loans. 
This is a law, Madam President, that works. And it is a law where benefits can be seen in every new home that gets built or new business that gets started in a neighborhood or town that used to be neglected by the banking industry prior to 1977. 
If there are specific problems with the implementation of CRA, if there are certain activities that should be considered that are not considered, then the appropriate way to address those specific concerns is to work with the regulators to improve the way that the law is being administered. 
But to exempt 86 percent of America's banks from a requirement to serve their entire community, while still extending them the benefit of deposit insurance which is backed by the dollars of everyone in that community, is simply wrongheaded in the approach to helping the banking industry. 
At the end of the day, Madam President, the best thing that Congress can do to help community banks is to provide the means for all American communities to grow, thus expanding the demand for bank loans and products. CRA helps all of us achieve that goal and, therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. 
Lastly, Madam President, I will come back to the point I made at the outset. I urge my colleagues to think about this: Even if the idea of CRA should be reworked and redone, even if you think it deserves a legislative approach, if it ends up being adopted on this credit union bill, it will bring down this piece of legislation. That would be a great disservice to the millions of people who are looking to this Chamber to follow what was done in the other Chamber, and that is to pass these reforms that are necessary for credit unions to succeed. For those reasons, Madam President, I urge that this body reject the Shelby amendment. 
Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am very pleased that today we take up the reauthorization of the the Community Opportunities, Accountability, Training and Educational Services (COATS) Act, which includes Head Start, LIHEAP and the Community Service Block Grant. This bill is sponsored by Chairman Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, Senator Coats, and myself, and was reported unanimously by the Labor and Human Resources Committee a month ago. This strong record of bipartisan support is a clear statement of how we all view these crucial programs. But it is also a testament to the leadership of Senator Coats on this legislation. As a tribute, we on the Committee insisted on naming this important bill after him. 
This bill is fundamentally about improving the reach of opportunity in America to all of our citizens. 
Head Start will serve over 830,000 children and their families this year; nearly 6,000 in my home state of Connecticut. These families and their children will receive access to the nation's leading child development program. Head Start focuses on the needs of the whole child. Inherently, we know that a child cannot be successful if he or she has unidentified health needs, if his or her parents are not involved in their education, and if he or she is not well-nourished or well-rested. Head Start is the embodiment of those concerns and works each day to meet children's critical needs. 
The bill before us today further strengthens the Head Start program: We continue the expansion of the Early Head Start program, increasing the set aside for this program to 10 percent in FY 2002. Anyone who has picked up a magazine or newspaper within the last year knows how vital the first three years of a child's life are to their development. This program, which we established in 1994, extends comprehensive, high-quality services to these young children and their parents, to make sure the most is made of this window of opportunity. 
We have added new provisions to encourage collaboration within states and local communities as well as within individual Head Start programs to expand the services they offer to families to full-day and full-year services, where appropriate, and to leverage other child care dollars to improve quality and better meet family needs. 
We emphasize the importance of school readiness and literacy preparation in Head Start. While I think this has always been a critical part of Head Start, this bill ensures that gains will continue to be made in this area. 
Mr. President, this bill puts Head Start on strong footing as we approach the 21st Century. It is a framework within which Head Start can continue to grow to meet the needs of more children and their families. What is unfortunate is that we cannot guarantee more funding for Head Start--I think it is shameful that there are waiting lists for Head Start and that only 40 percent of eligible children are served by this program. And Early Head Start, which is admittedly a new program, serves just a tiny fraction of the infants and toddlers in need of these services. 
The President has set a laudable goal to reach 1 million children by 2002. But I say we need to do more. We need a plan to serve 2 million children--all those eligible and in need of services--as soon as possible. 
Some argue that meeting the goal of fully funding Head Start will be too costly. Yes, it will cost a great deal to get there. But my question is how much more will it cost not to get there? 
Studies show us that children in quality early childhood development programs, such as Head Start, start school more ready to learn than their non-Head Start counterparts. They are more likely to keep up with their classmates, avoid placement in special education, and graduate from high school. They are also less likely to become teenage mothers and fathers, go on welfare, or become involved in violence or the criminal justice system. 
How much does it cost when we don't see these benefits? 
I know this is an issue for another place and another venue. But I am hopeful as we strengthen the program we can also strengthen our resolve to expand this successful program to more children and their families. 
Mr. President, the bill before us also makes important changes to the Community Services Block Grant program. CSBG makes funds available to states and local communities to assist low-income individuals and help alleviate the causes of poverty. One thousand local service providers--mainly Community Action Agencies--use these federal funds to address the root causes of poverty within their communities. CSBG dollars are particularly powerful because local communities have substantial flexibility in determining where these dollars are best spent to meet their local circumstances. 
I have had the pleasure of visiting Community Action Agencies in Connecticut many times. They are exciting, vibrant places at the very center of their communities--filled with adults taking literacy and job training courses, children at Head Start centers, seniors with housing or other concerns, and youths participating in programs or volunteering their time. 
To see clearly how critical the CSBG program is to the nation's low income families, one only needs to look at the statistics. The CSBG program in 1995 served more than 11.5 million people, or one in three Americans living in poverty. Three-quarters of CSBG clients have incomes that fall below the federal poverty guideline. 
This bill recognizes the fundamental strength of this program and makes modest changes to encourage broader participation by neighborhood groups. In addition, it improves the accountability of local programs. 
This bill also reauthorizes the vitally important Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. Nearly 4.2 million low-income households received LIHEAP assistance during FY1996, more than 70,000 households in Connecticut. One quarter of those assisted by LIHEAP funds are elderly. Another 25 percent are individuals with disabilities. I cannot overvalue the importance of this assistance--it is nearly as necessary as food and water to a low-income senior citizen or family with children seeking help to stay warm in the winter--or as we have seen recently in the Southwest--to stay cool during the summer. 
This bill makes no fundamental changes to the LIHEAP program. I am very pleased we increase the authorization of the program to $2 billion, which recognizes the great need for this help. I wish House appropriators, who eliminated the program earlier this month, shared this commitment to meeting these most basic needs. We also put into place a system to more accurately and quickly designate natural disasters. Early disaster designation will allow for the more efficient distribution of the critically important emergency LIHEAP funds, aiding States devastated by a natural disaster. 
This bill contains one new, important program--the Individual Development Accounts, based on a bill offered by Senator Coats and Senator Harkin. Individual Development Accounts, or IDA's, are dedicated savings accounts for very low income families, similar in structure to IRA's, that can be used to pay for post-secondary education, buy a first home, or capitalize a business. This program is a welcome addition to the Human Services Act family. The Assets for Independence title will provide low-income individuals and families with new opportunities to move their families out of poverty through savings. 
This is strong bill and it is a good bill. And I want to thank Senator Coats again for his committed leadership on this important bill.

Mr. DODD. Let me thank my colleagues who are here, and I will keep these remarks brief. I thank my colleagues from Colorado, North Carolina, and Missouri. 
Briefly, Mr. President, let me, first of all, extend my compliments to the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee and the ranking member, Senator D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes, for their excellent leadership in bringing this bill on credit unions to the floor. This is a very, very important piece of legislation. I think most of my colleagues who have followed this debate hoped we wouldn't have had to come to the floor with a credit union bill. But as a result of Supreme Court decisions, we have been forced to act, and to act expeditiously in this Congress. In fact, as a result of a letter drafted by the chairman, several others, and myself, we have asked the court not to initiate their decision so that there would be time for us legislatively to respond to the Supreme Court decision. 
This is not just any other bill we are bringing up that may or may not have some importance on the Legislative Calendar. It is critical that before this Congress adjourn this piece of legislation be considered and adopted and signed into law if we are going to provide the kind of relief that must be sought as a result of the AT&T credit union decision. 
Again, my compliments to the leadership of Senator Domenici, Senator Sarbanes, and other members of the Banking Committee, who voted 16-2, I think was the vote, that brought this bill to the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
It is critically important. Why is it important? It is important because if we are going to see members of credit unions forced to leave their credit unions as a result of the AT&T credit union decision, the resulting loss of those members could cause a credit union to become insolvent. That is the problem here, and that in itself would create a drain on the taxpayer-backed deposit insurance fund. 
So, it is very, very important we not allow those credit unions to run the risk of losing its membership as a result of that decision or our inability to act and then causing these credit unions to fail around the America. None of that will happen, obviously, if we move to adopt the legislation. 
I point out that in the House, the other body, they adopted the legislation, I think, something like 411-8. It was overwhelmingly adopted. I am confident that will be the case here, as well. We will get a good, strong vote provided we don't get sidetracked on some side issues. Whether they have merit or not, there will certainly be other vehicles in the minds of some people, but the idea we would allow it to be attached to this, running the risk--you run the risk of having this credit union legislation collapse. If that does happen, then the resulting consequences of that collapse will have to be borne by those who try to take advantage of this vehicle to add extraneous matters. That is very, very clear to credit union members all across the country. 
This is an opportunity for us to act on this bill. I have strong views about the amendment of our colleague from Alabama on CRA. I am opposed to what he wants to do. I know there are Members who strongly agree with what he wants to do. But also I will tell you that if you allow that provision to be added to this bill, you are going to cause this bill to fall. If that is the case, then the resulting consequences, I think, are terribly predictable. 
I am not going to necessarily, today, engage in the debate on the Shelby amendment on the CRA, Community Reinvestment Act, except to say that I know in my State of Connecticut for the literally thousands of members of credit unions, the millions in the State of New York and California and elsewhere all across this country who are watching this debate, knowing if this bill falls because of a desire of some to come up with an amendment here that has some appeal, I think the transparency of the efforts will be quite obvious that, in fact, it is really not the issue of CRA. 
There are those who, frankly, want to kill this bill, who don't like the credit union bill but don't really want to take it on directly and so will offer an extraneous amendment, hopefully, that might just narrowly get adopted, the bill collapses, and you have been able to sort of smuggle the destruction of this important piece of legislation through. It is extremely important that we deal with this bill in as clean a fashion as possible, no matter how appealing some of these amendments may be. So that is important. 
The second question obviously we want to still address is whether or not we want the maximum possible number of Americans to have the choice of joining a credit union. I think people ought to be free to make that choice of joining a credit union. The overwhelming majority of credit unions provide affordable financial services to working families all across this country. 
Let me draw one theme that has been raised during consideration of the bill--that is whether credit unions have lost their mission of serving middle-income Americans and families of modest means, which was written into the original act. The question surfaced because of a campaign of misinformation, in my view, prompted by some industries that compete with credit unions. During the Banking Committee hearing of these issues, back in March, one banking industry representative stated that `credit union membership had become so compromised that membership was being offered to members of wealthy country clubs.' I am not making up this example. This one actually happened. 
Needless to say, those who support credit unions were very upset about that allegation because it would run contrary to the thrust of what credit unions are supposed to do. We examined that allegation and it is was true, in fact, that there were wealthy country club memberships. 
What they fail to tell you is that the people being solicited to join the credit union were the cooks, janitors, groundskeepers, and others. They weren't members of the country club, they worked at the country club. Yet, if you listened to the allegation, you assumed it was people who paid significant fees to join the club, rather than employees. That is the sort of misinformation that is going on to try to destroy this bill and this important credit union organization across the country. 
The average credit union is still very small in size. It is limited by the number of people they serve. In my State of Connecticut--an affluent State, a strong middle class State--the average size of a credit union as an institution is $16 million in assets. In fact, if you take all the assets of all of my credit unions in Connecticut and total them up, they don't equal the assets of one of my 10 largest banks in the State of Connecticut. I know that is not true in every State, but in Connecticut, which is a fairly affluent State and has an aggressive, strong credit union organization, total assets of all of my credit union members don't equal the size of any one of the 10 largest banks. 
In fact, assets of all the 11,392 federally insured credit unions was $327 billion, or less than the size of Chase Manhattan Bank or Citibank. The asset size of the 11,452 federally insured banks is $5.2 trillion, compared to $327 billion for all the credit unions. So the notion that somehow this is some great threat to commercial banking in this country, I think, is unwarranted, it is not credible at all. Small banks and thrifts are threatened in many ways in this country, but I suggest that they are much more threatened by aggressive banking giants like NationsBank than by any credit union. The loss of banking services in many communities that I visited has much more to do with aggressive takeovers and consolidations practiced by large national financial institutions or large regional institutions than it does competition from credit unions. That is the least of these smaller banks' and community banks' threats. 
The facts show that while credit unions have experienced modest growth since the implementation of the multiple common bond, that growth is dwarfed by the growth in the banking industry. 
Ultimately, the complaints of the bank and thrift industry boil down not so much to a loss of market share but to the fact that credit unions offer customers a pretty good deal. They offer customers higher interest rates on savings and checking, as well as lower interest rates on credit cards and certain kinds of loans; credit unions don't charge their customers a fee for every conceivable type of transaction. We have reached a point in the banking industry where seeking out a new fee income has replaced seeking out new loan business as the way to make profits. 
Not only are banks generating $3 billion a year in ATM fees--a subject matter that the chairman of the committee cares deeply about--$3 billion a year in ATM fees in excess of their costs, but some banks even started charging customers for using a deposit slip at branches, or for having the temerity to actually call a live person--if you can ever find one--on the phone during normal business hours. 
While the banks claim that credit unions offer a better deal because they don't pay taxes, that is also a fiction. Credit unions have no access to capital markets to raise funds; they keep the capital needed to stay in business only through retained earnings. That is vastly different from what the banks do. Moreover, the banks also don't acknowledge the many tax advantages they enjoy, such as being able to write off billions in taxes every year for loan losses that never occur, or for receiving a tax credit for any minimal premium they must pay toward maintaining taxpayer-guaranteed deposit insurance. 
Credit unions are nonprofit organizations that put their earnings into both creating capital and keeping costs down for their customers, the actions that were precisely envisioned by Congress in establishing the Federal credit unions of 1934. 
So, Mr. President, I think there is an important role that our credit unions play. There is good, healthy competition out there. Let me end where I began. That is, I urge my colleagues--those of you who truly care about allowing the Supreme Court decision to be dealt with legislatively--there is only one window where we are going to get a chance to do this. Even if you find yourself attracted to a standing-alone provision on the CRA issue--which I don't, but some do--even if you are slightly attracted to that amendment, by supporting that amendment you will bring down this bill, and then people are going to understand what happened here. 
So I certainly endorse and support the comments of our colleague from Illinois, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, who speaks eloquently on the issue of the Community Reinvestment Act--the strength of it, how well it has worked, and how well it is working in reaching sectors of our society that have been too often in years past denied access to financial services in our country. I think it would be a mistake to jeopardize this credit union bill, which has come out of our committee with such a strong vote and such a strong vote in the other body. 
I think on Monday we can certainly do a great deal to relieve the anxiety and fears of literally millions of people across the country who utilize credit unions for their financial security and their futures. They are going to be terribly disappointed in this body if we get involved in extraneous matters and bring this bill down. So over the weekend, I urge that members of credit unions across the country certainly let their Members of Congress know how important this bill is to them and how important it would be to keep off amendments that could destroy our ability to pass this legislation. 
I thank my colleagues for their graciousness. I compliment the chairman and Senator Sarbanes for their fine work on this bill.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment designed to give parents a tool to help protect their children from pornography and sexual predators on the Internet. According to Wired magazine, there are currently some 28,000 web sites containing hard- and soft-core pornography. And that number is growing at an alarming rate, it is estimated that 50 pornographic sites are added to the Internet each day. 
Sadly, many of out children are, out of curiosity or by accident, exposed to such sites while surfing the web. They type in search terms as innocuous as `toys'--only to find graphic images and language on their display terminal. 
Mr. President, the Internet is profoundly changing the way we learn and communicate with people. Today, our children have unprecedented access to educational material through the Internet. It provides children with vast opportunities to learn about art, culture and history--the possibilities are endless. 
However, this advanced technology also brings with it a dark side for our children. Many children who are browsing the net--often unaccompanied by an adult--come across material that is unsuitable for them, and is oftentimes sexually explicit. 
Mr. President, every parent worries about strangers approaching their children in their neighborhood or on the playground at school. And they teach their children how to avoid these strangers. But, today, these strangers are literally inside our homes. They are only a mouse click away from our children. In our libraries and bookstores, we store reading material that is harmful to minors in areas accessible only to adults. Yet, in cyberspace, these same materials are as accessible to a child as his or her favorite bedtime story. 
Pornography and predators are now reaching our children, via the Internet, in the privacy and safety of their own homes and classrooms. This kind of access to our children is alarming, and this invasion of our children's privacy and innocence is unconscionable. 
We, as a nation, have an obligation to ensure that surfing the web remains a safe and viable option for our children. We have a responsibility to make sure that they are able to learn and grow in an environment free of sexual predators and pornographic images. Clearly, there is no substitute for parental supervision. Yet, I think we can all agree that many parents know less about the Internet than their children. Parents are convinced of the Internet's educational value, but they feel anxious about their ability to supervise children while they use it. 
In my view, it is important that we encourage parents and children to use the Internet together. But clearly, it is difficult for any adult to monitor children online all of the time. 
Therefore, I believe we need to provide our parents with the tools to protect and guide our children. The amendment I offer today is a modest measure designed to provide one such tool. It would ensure that Internet access providers make screening software available to customers purchasing Internet access services. 
The amendment would allow customers to have the opportunity to obtain--either for a fee or no charge, as determined by the provider--screening software that permits customers to limit access to material on the Internet that is harmful to minors. Like going to the pharmacy and being asked if you want a child-proof lid for a prescription medication, my bill would require that Internet access providers ask parents whether they would like to obtain screening software. 
It is not a guarantee that children using the Internet would be protected from pornography and predators. And it is not a substitute for parental supervision. But it can be an extension of parental supervision--a tool we put in their hands to help protect their kids--much as we did when we voted to give parents the v-chip. 
I hope my colleagues will endorse this amendment, and I urge its adoption.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, had I been present for the vote regarding waiving the Budget Act for Senator Wellstone's amendment, I would have voted to waive the Budget Act. Senator Wellstone's amendment addresses the same issue as the point of order Senator Murray raised earlier this week. I supported Senator Murray then in her effort to ensure that veterans receive the compensation they are due, and I support Senator Wellstone. Although the Budget Act was not waived by a vote of 54-40, Senator Wellstone's effort was fitting and praiseworthy. 
Veterans who suffer from smoking-related illnesses must be compensated by the government that encouraged them to smoke during their military service. During World War II, the government included cigarettes in the rations it issued to troops. Long after the government stopped issuing cigarettes, a `smoke `em if you got `em' culture pervaded military life. That culture led troops to begin and continue smoking, so this government has an obligation to do right by the men and women who once fought this nation's enemies. Many of those men and women are now locked in a different sort of combat. They battle against life-threatening, smoking-related illnesses, and in the meantime, this government is shifting funds away from veterans to pay for roads. 
Today, the addictive nature of cigarettes is well known. Many veterans now smoke because they started during their military service. The government cannot deny this fact, nor can it walk away from veterans by denying them the compensation they are due. I will continue to stand with my colleagues who support providing for our veterans' needs.

Mr. DODD. Madam President, I just wanted to raise an issue to my colleague from Missouri, the manager of the bill, and the distinguished Senator from Maryland. This is just as an issue to raise with you. We may want to take a look at it. I regret I didn't bring this up earlier. 
Under the present system, as I understand it, nurses at VA hospitals do not receive cost-of-living adjustments. It is based on locality pay. In many areas around the country, nurses in our VA hospitals have not been getting raises. It is a bit more complicated an issue than just a simple amendment to deal with this, but for the last 3 years, in many veterans hospitals there have been no cost-of-living or locality increases during a robust economy. 
Many of these, mostly women but some men, work very hard on behalf of our veterans. I know all my colleagues know and understand this. I urge, if we could, maybe enter into a colloquy in some way and look at report language in which we might examine that issue in terms of how, for nurses who work in these hospitals, we may be able to work out some better pay increase arrangement for them at these VA hospitals. I really raise that for the consideration of the two managers of the bill. 
I apologize for interrupting what I know is a decision to just move to final passage on this bill.

Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me say, I thank both the distinguished Senator from Missouri and the distinguished Senator from Maryland for their comments. As I said, I think it is a complicated issue. I don't mean to suggest it is simple. But I really do appreciate--I know the nurses all across the country who work in our veterans hospitals really appreciate the attention I know our colleagues will give to this issue, to see if some mechanism can be offered to try to address this issue. 
I am very grateful to both of them. I know the nurses in the hospital in West Haven, CT, are, and I am certain they are in other parts of the country as well.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward proposal and is similar to legislation that was offered by my colleague in the other body, Congressman Shays of Connecticut. This amendment deals with the issue of defective pharmaceutical products and medical devices that have been recalled by the manufacturer. 
We almost had a very tragic case in Connecticut several months ago involving recalls, which provoked this piece of legislation. A child in Connecticut, a young boy by the name of Matthew McGarry, has food allergies to peanuts and needs a device known as an Epi-Pen to counteract the severe reactions--seizures or even death--that could result if he inadvertently eats certain foods. The Epi-Pen that Matthew relies on was recalled by the manufacturer because it was found to have substantial leaks in it, rendering it ineffective. 
Matthew was fortunate that his school nurse, Betty Patterson, heard of the recall and immediately notified his parents, Karen and William McGarry, that they needed to replace the product. Had she not heard of the recall and had young Matthew had an attack, he very well could have died. The family is very well aware that a tragedy was averted. 
His family and other Connecticut families brought this to the attention of Congressman Shays and myself and suggested this would be an appropriate area for some thoughtful legislation to require that consumers be notified when dangerous products are taken off the market--a requirement not currently found in law. 
Consumers have the right to be notified when the cars they drive or the toys their children play with are unsafe. Shouldn't they have the same right when it comes to drugs and devices found in every family's medicine cabinet? 
The recall process presently relies almost exclusively on the good-faith efforts of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. Most of the time it works very well to protect consumers. However, a recent spate of recalls involving these Epi-Pen devices--first in October of 1997 and most recently in May of this year--has highlighted the need to better ensure that consumers, when appropriate, are directly informed that a drug or device may be dangerous. 
An Epi-Pen is a device, as my colleagues, I am sure, are aware, that injects epinephrine and is used by children with severe food allergies to counteract life-threatening reactions. Due to a defect in the manufacturing process, some lots of the device were found to leak the encapsulated drug, potentially leaving patients with an amount of the drug insufficient to counter an allergic response. 
A class I recall of the product was issued, indicating a reasonable possibility that the use of the product could cause serious health effects or death. Despite the severity of the defect, the recall notification failed to notify consumers whose children relied on these products, either because the retailers did not pass along the notification in a timely fashion or because the retailers themselves received notification days after the recall was first issued. 
In an effort to provide the public with better and more timely notice of the most serious recalls, this amendment will, for the first time, explicitly require the Food and Drug Administration to ensure that consumers receive prompt notification of class I recalls. 
How the directive will be accomplished will be left up to the FDA. We don't mandate a specific approach. The FDA could, for example, encourage distributors and pharmacies to employ more effective and rapid notification technologies, a shift that some in the industry are already advocating. We do not micromanage the notification process. We are just suggesting that better mechanisms be put in place to give consumers who use these products and rely on them a higher degree of confidence. 
I hope my colleagues can support this straightforward amendment. I hope that my colleagues will recognize that if we do not take up this issue now, we run the risk that some other child won't be as lucky as Matthew and will suffer serious harm. For those reasons, Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.

Mr. DODD. That is correct. What I intend by the amendment is to make certain that in the case of every Class 1 recall FDA does provide notice to the public. I certainly would not want to do anything to suggest that such authority does not now exist, or that such authority does not exist for Class 2 and Class 3 recalls, or other actions as deemed appropriate for public notice by FDA. I just want to make certain that they use their authority in all Class 1 recalls.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me return to the amendment to mention several people here who deserve a great deal of credit for bringing this issue to the attention of Congressman Shays and myself. 
Betty Patterson is the nurse at St. Theresa's School in Trumbull, CT. There are thousands and thousands of school nurses all across America who probably don't get enough credit for the work and job they do every day, caring for our children while they are away at school. It was Betty Patterson who came across the notification that the EPI-PEN had been recalled, and knew that one of the students in the St. Theresa school, Matthew, would need to get a safe and effective replacement. 
First, I want to congratulate Betty Patterson for the tremendous job she did. 
Second, I'd like to commend Karen McGarry, Mathew's mother, who, discovering that her pharmacist had not notified his patients, contacted the Connecticut Post, a major newspaper in my home State of Connecticut, to look into the matter. And I'd like to commend Michael Mayko of the Connecticut Post who wrote stories on this incident and did the checking to discover that there was no Federal law or State law that required that consumers be notified. So I want to thank him for doing so much to highlight this important story. 
Of course, I want to thank Matthew himself, who is one of 1.47 million people in this country who suffer from severe allergies and must rely on products like the Epi-Pen, for telling his story. 
Mr. President, I'd like to once again restate that this amendment simply says that the Food and Drug Administration, when working with manufacturers to plan a class I recall, should take all appropriate measures to ensure that consumers are directly and promptly notified. I think most would agree this should be a commonsense requirement. 
For those reasons, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will feel confident in supporting this amendment. I don't seek any recorded votes on it. If the majority and minority can accept it, I am prepared to conclude the debate and go to other amendments. I don't know what their pleasure is. 
I see my distinguished floor manager rising. I yield to him.

Mr. DODD. Madam President, I, too, rise and commend our colleague from Indiana for this amendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment, along with a number of my colleagues. To use the language in another situation, this is indeed a very modest proposal. This is prospective. It affects none of the sanctions that are presently in place. 
As the Senator from Indiana has rightly pointed out, sanctions are a very effective and useful tool when applied well. I think the threat of sanctions may have an even greater impact in utility. I certainly agree with him on that. 
What he is merely asking us to support today is that when a proposed sanction is being suggested by the executive branch--by the way, I wish we were applying this to ourselves because too often, when the Congress of the United States offers sanctions legislation, which is oftentimes where these bills originate, we should also be asking the question of what is the cost-benefit effect of this proposal. It doesn't say don't impose the sanction. In fact, there may be situations that arise when, in fact, the outrage is so egregious that is the subject of the sanction that we would be more than willing to pay the economic price to impose it. This amendment does not preclude that result. It merely suggests that we have some ability to make an analysis of what that relationship would be and to ask for a few days to allow for objective analysis of what the sanction cost might be. I hope this will enjoy strong, unanimous, bipartisan support. 
We have heard eloquent statements made on the floor of this Chamber, Madam President, over the last several weeks, as I think all of us have begun to focus on sanctions policies as a result of the tragic events in India and Pakistan with the detonation of nuclear weaponry. That was a very sad occasion, still a very worrisome occasion in terms of what it means and the implications for us in the near term and longer term. 
If there has been any silver lining, if you will, in these clouds, to draw an even tighter analogy, it is that I think everyone in this Chamber has stepped back a little bit and said, 
What are these sanctions policies and how do they work? What is going on here? Are we really achieving the desired results that are the subject of our rhetoric in speeches? Are we causing policies to be changed in countries on whom we impose sanctions? Are the political elite of these nations affected by our policies? Are they in some way being impacted by these decisions? What damage do we do to ourselves in the process as a result of sanctions being imposed? Are average people in these countries, who have nothing to do with setting policies, being affected in some way? What does that do in terms of eroding support for our country and our policies where public support in foreign countries can be pivotal in unpopular decisions that may have been made by allies of ours around the world? What sort of corrosive effect do sanctions have on those decisions? 
I think these are good questions that deserve answers. What the Senator from Indiana has suggested is that, at least in one aspect of these, that we know and understand what the cost-benefit relationship is. 
Madam President, at a later point in this debate, I will offer another amendment dealing with food and medicine, to merely just take food, medicine, and agricultural products off the table as a tool of sanctions, for the primary reason that I don't think it has any impact on trying to modify the behavior of nations on whom we have a substantial or less-than-substantial agreement. I will wait for the appropriate time to do it when this debate is concluded. 
I also have authored, along with my friend, whom I see on this floor, who has cosponsored that amendment, Senator Hagel from Nebraska, Senator Roberts from Kansas, Senator Warner from Virginia, Senator Burns from Montana, Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, proposals that will deal with a broader issue of how sanctions ought to be dealt with. But I will save that debate for a later day. It is a broader question and one for which we have a task force taking a look at some of these issues. I certainly want to make sure we are heading in the right direction. 
On the food and medicine and agricultural products, I think that makes a lot of sense, and I will offer that at the appropriate time. 
I conclude by urging my colleagues to be supportive of the Lugar proposal. It is a significant step in the right direction and one that I think deserves broad-based support as we try to sort out how best to advance our foreign policy interests while not unnecessarily doing damage to our own Nation and to innocent people around the world, particularly in the unilateral application of these sanctions. 
With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment and the second-degree amendment, which fills out the tree on behalf of myself, Senator Warner, Senator Roberts, Senator Hagel, Senator Dorgan, Senator Grams and Senator Harkin. 
Very simply, what this amendment does is codify what Members have expressed over the last several days that they would like to see accomplished worldwide. We eliminated last week the use of food and medicine to people as a sanction in the case of Pakistan and India. We felt that was an unwise use of the sanctions; that average people, poor people should not suffer at the hands of our Nation despite the decisions made by the power elite in their own nations. 
What my colleagues and I who have offered this amendment today are suggesting is that same principle ought to be applied worldwide. It is counter to everything we stand for as a people--everything we stand for. To deny people anywhere in the world food and medicine--basic food and medicine--runs contrary to the moral values that we embrace as a people. 
Whatever anger we may feel and properly focus on the leadership of nations, we should not cause the innocent people of those nations to suffer as a result of our policies. For far too long, we have allowed the use of food and medicine to be used. There are only two or three countries in the world that today allow their food and their medicine to be used as a tool in foreign policy or as part of a sanctions policy. 
Tonight we have an opportunity to change that law, to say that with regard to any sanctions policy, whatever other tools we may want to use depriving countries of certain economic issues, technical equipment, military hardware, availability of our lending institutions--whatever else we may want to use--that food and medicine will not be a part of that mix. 
I hope no one has any illusion that in the case of a Saddam Hussein or a Fidel Castro or the leaders of North Korea, the leaders of Iran, I guarantee you tonight that they are eating well. I promise you that if they get sick, they get medicine and they see doctors. 
Too often, we have allowed our foreign policy to also work against the innocent people who live in these regimes, in these terrorist countries. If this amendment is adopted, I am told that there will be an amendment offered immediately thereafter which will say that this provision should not apply to terrorist countries. None of us want anything to do with terrorist countries, but does anyone in this Chamber or America believe that the average Iraqi citizen, that the average citizen in Iran, that the average citizen in Cuba or North Korea, despite the leadership of their nation, should suffer because their leaders may engage in activities which are cruel or support terrorist activities? 
I happen to believe that ought not to be the case; that the use of food and medicine ought not to be a vehicle in the conduct of our foreign policy. 
Mr. President, it was noted earlier today that we have become extremely generous in the application of the sanctions policy. Since World War II, there have been 100 occasions where the United States has imposed sanctions. More than 60 percent of those sanctions have occurred since 1993. 
And 61 U.S. laws and Executive orders have been enacted authorizing various types of unilateral economic sanctions against 35 countries in the name of foreign policy. The sanctioned countries comprise 42 percent of the world's population. Roughly 2.3 billion people--potential customers of U.S. goods and services--are being affected. 
Mr. President, I suggest that to deprive these people of foodstuffs--I hear that one of the reasons that our farmers are not doing well in this country is because of the difficulty in foreign sales. Aside from the legitimate concern about seeing to it that innocent people are not going to be deprived of food and medicine, here is an opportunity to be able to sell some products that can actually benefit the people in these countries. 
Why not take an argument away from those terrorist leaders, those dictators, who constantly want to point to us, the United States, as the reason their economies are in trouble? Why not say this evening that: You can no longer point an accusing finger at America when it comes to the issue of your children, your innocent women, your innocent civilians, from getting food or medicine? We no longer use that tool in our foreign policy. If your people are suffering, it is not because the United States is banning the exportation of food and medicine. It is because of the economic policies of your own leadership. 
Tonight, no matter how angry and legitimate that anger may be at a dictator or a terrorist leader of a country, let us not say to the poor people who have to live under those dictators and terrorists that the United States, as a result of our own policies, will deny you the opportunity to get decent food and decent medicine. 
Let us not be a part of only two or three other nations--Third World countries--that I can find who use that kind of a vehicle in the conduct of their foreign policy. There is not a single member of the industrialized world, the civilized world, that utilizes food and medicine. We are the only example of it. 
Tonight we have an opportunity, across the board, to eliminate the use of food and medicine as a part of our sanctions policy--still have sanctions, still deprive them, if you will, of the advantage of our engineering, our technology, our military hardware, but we are not going to say that food ought to be a part of that. 
Let us join the rest of the world in eliminating that. We, the United States of America, we, the nation who embraces, with great legitimacy, the issue of human rights where innocents are involved, where the meals and the food they need and the medicine they require are involved, we are not going to be the nation that deprives them of the opportunity to use some of the best products in the world. 
Mr. President, the world looks to us, particularly in the area of medical devices and medicines. And to deprive poor people of an opportunity to get some of those medicines, to get some of the food--the best grown in the world--I think would be a tragedy. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment. 
I note my colleagues are here from Nebraska and Kansas and may want to be heard on this issue. I yield the floor and request how much time may remain. 
We don't have time agreements, do we? No time agreements?

It only applies to unilateral economic sanctions. For instance, this amendment does nothing with regard to the multilateral sanctions on Iraq. Those are not unilateral sanctions. Those are multilateral sanctions that apply to that country. So it only applies there. If the President, this President, or any future President, wants to apply sanctions on some basis other than economic, they may utilize this tool. We are merely removing it from the unilateral economic sanctions.

Mr. DODD. It is a question. 
Mr. President, the authors and I could not be more clear. This is unilateral economic sanctions, and clearly in the case of some countries where we have applied that, food and medicine come off. Now, if the President wants to apply sanctions on some basis other than economic sanctions, he has all the freedom to do so. 
A wonderful example of that we have just debated over the last 2 weeks. Here India and Pakistan detonate two nuclear weapons. I do not know what you could argue may be more threatening to the long-term security of the United States than 
two nations detonating nuclear weapons. We voted 98 to nothing to take off food and medicine as a part of the sanctions policy there. 
All I and my colleagues are saying here in this case is that if the President wants to impose sanctions on the basis of something other than unilateral economic sanctions, he can do that without any restriction of this amendment. But when he only goes to impose, or we go to impose, Members of Congress--and we are far more guilty of this, by the way. Let's face it, we are talking about ourselves to some degree, and we all know what goes on here. We have a proliferation of these amendments. We all draft and issue the press releases to satisfy constituencies in this country. That is what happens. And we apply unilateral economic sanctions and deny people food and medicine, and we think that ought to stop, but not if you want to impose sanctions on bases other than economic and unilateral sanctions.

Mr. DODD. I think I have a question at the end of this one. 
Mr. President, I know my colleague from Florida is very familiar with Cardinal Ortega, who is the leading Catholic figure on the island of Cuba. I know he knows who he is, and is aware of the recent visit by His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, when he was in Cuba in January. Obviously, my colleague is well aware, as well, of the position of the U.S. Catholic Conference with regard to lifting the sanctions on food and medicine. 
I say and raise the question, certainly we all, I think, would know--and my colleague, I presume, would agree--that Castro, Fidel Castro, has no greater enemy on the island of Cuba, or anywhere, for that matter, than Cardinal Ortega, yet is it not the fact that Cardinal Ortega, the Catholic Conference, and in fact His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, has called for the lifting of restrictions on food and medicine sales when it comes to Cuba?

Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for the question. If I thought for a single second that anything I might offer in this amendment would win his support, I would engage it with a higher degree of seriousness. 
Obviously, I can be confident that any American President would want to make sure that any program we were endorsing on the sale of food and medicine was going to maximize the potential for it to reach the intended consumer, and that is the innocent people in these countries. 
But let me, if I can, come back to some points that have been made here over the last hour and a half or so. 
First of all, we have heard about Lockerbie. I take a backseat to no one in my sense of outrage, nor do any of my colleagues who support this amendment, over the grotesque and violent shooting down of Pan Am Flight 103 that caused such a tremendous loss of life over Lockerbie, Scotland. 
But let me take Libya off the table. There are multilateral sanctions against Libya. There is nothing in this bill that affects Pan Am Flight 103. And to suggest so is to not have read the amendment nor to understand the sanctions regimen against Libya. It is multilateral sanctions. This bill is unilateral sanctions only on economics. 
So to raise the prospect of the tragedy over Lockerbie in the face of this amendment is either not to understand what exists in Libya or not to understand what this amendment proposes. So Libya is not in play at all. 
I point out that many of my colleagues over the last few days have indicated their own strong feelings on the subject of the use of food and medicine as a tool of our sanctions policy with unilateral economic sanctions. My colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, quoting him in his remarks of the day during the debate on Pakistan and India, and I quote: `Cutting ourselves off through unilateral sanctions seldom benefits us as a nation, and almost always hurts the producer. Food should never be used as a tool of foreign policy.' 
Our colleague from Montana, Senator Burns: `Let me tell you a little bit about sanctions. I have never been convinced that sanctions on food really worked.' 
Our colleague from Kansas says, who is the Presiding Officer, if I may in his presence quote him in that debate: `Food being used as a tool of foreign policy should never ever occur.' 
Senator Dorgan: `We ought to decide as Congress right now that sanctions do not include food shipments.' 
I can go on. Our colleagues, I think, across party lines, across the great spectrum of this country, have come to realize that, as my good friend and colleague from Nebraska so eloquently pointed out, we are a great nation. We are the most powerful nation on the face of this Earth economically, and militarily. We are the envy of the world politically. And for us on this evening to say that this great power still finds it necessary in order to advance its foreign policy interests that food and medicine that would go into the mouths and bodies of innocent people who live in these dreadful regimes may be the subject of unilateral economic sanctions, I think, is sad. I think it is sad. 
We who sit here this evening and have full meals--those who oppose these policies and never worry about whether or not their child can get an inoculation, or an immunization, whether or not they are ever going to have food on their table--look in the face of an innocent North Korean child, if you want to, or look in the face of an innocent Cuban child who has to live under Fidel Castro--that child didn't make that choice. That family didn't make that choice. Are we in this great power of ours, the United States of America, saying this evening that we will not allow the sale of food or medicine to help out that child of those countries? I don't believe that. I don't believe that. I think we are bigger, I think we are better than that. 
I think this debate on sanctions has been healthy. It is beginning to recognize the awakening in America that, as our colleague from the farm States and others have pointed out, we need to have policies that work--not that make us feel good. This is not about press releases. It is not about satisfying constituencies here at home. It is about doing something that advances our legitimate foreign policy interests. Do we do that by causing injury to our own people and causing injury to innocent people in these countries while the elite economically and politically grow fat on their own dictatorships at the expense of their own people, and we in our own unwitting way assist them in that process? 
Mr. President, I hope as our colleagues come over here--this is not about endorsing terrorism or excusing Libya in Flight 103, or any other dreadful atrocity that a dictator has imposed. It says that with regard to unilateral economic sanctions the United States of America, at the close of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, that we take food and medicine with regard to unilateral sanctions off the table--we take it off the table--and we will advance our cause by building support on the suggestion in the minds and hearts of innocent people in these countries that they overthrow these very dictators, and we let them know this evening that we are not going to allow our wealth and our technology, which has produced the largest abundance of food and the best medicines in the world--that if we can get them to these people, we want to see that it happens and that we stand for that. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment which has been offered by a bipartisan group of us--from the East, in the Midwest, the far West--this evening, and that it be supported by our colleagues. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senate has just expressed its will on this issue. My colleagues, Senator Roberts, Senator Hagel, Senator Warner, Senator Grams, and Senator Dorgan and I offered the amendment and, in fact, included language by Senator Roberts which very specifically allows the President to retain or impose any of the above sanctions if he determines such sanctions to be in the national interest of the United States. 
Our underlying amendment only deals with unilateral economic sanctions. On any nation where there are multilateral sanctions, such as Libya and Iraq, this amendment would not apply. It is only in those countries where there are unilateral sanctions being imposed. 
Now, it should come as no great surprise to my colleagues that the nations on whom we impose unilateral sanctions are the very nations that my colleague from New Jersey would now like to exempt. What we have been suggesting here this evening is that this great Nation, as my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, so eloquently said--this great Nation, with its great economic and military power, we ought to be able to take food and medicine out of the arsenal of sanctions we use for the very economic elite and political elite of these terrorist countries. They do not suffer for lack of food. They do not suffer for lack of medicine. It is the innocents who live under these regimes who pay the price, and also the very farmers of this country who grow the products who are suffering today as a result of a farm crisis, denied the opportunity where there are nations who can afford to buy these products who pay the price. And we do not change policy in these countries. 
With all due respect to my good friend from New Jersey and those who would support this amendment, we have provided for language here that would allow for an exception should that occasion arise. But let us not undo the will that the Senate just expressed on the underlying amendment to take food and medicine off the table. Use whatever other sanctions we will or we might, but food and medicine ought not to be a part of the unilateral economic sanctions regime that this country would seek to impose.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, to do something here in the Senate that will help the farmers back in our State. 
As the Senate began debating the Agricultural Appropriations Bill for FY1999, it came to our attention that the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station was not eligible for certain federal grants under the 1996 Farm Bill and the Agricultural Research, Extension and Education Reform Act of 1998. 
The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station was established in 1875 as the first agricultural experiment station in the country. The station's mission is to put science to work for farmers and society. The work of this agriculture experiment station includes research projects on such issues as plant diseases, plant breeding, soil problems, and insects. 
The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station is the only state based station not affiliated with a land grant university in the nation. Unfortunately, the way the legislative language is written, this station would be excluded from grants available to every other agricultural experiment station in the country. Therefore, I joined with Senator Lieberman today to offer a technical correction amendment that would remedy this situation. 
This amendment will allow the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station to be eligible for these competitive federal grants. Allowing this station to apply for grants will help our farmers, our citizens and our students who have questions or concerns about such topics as plants, insects, soil and water. 
I thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Cochran and the ranking member Senator Bumpers for their help with this amendment. 
I hope that this amendment will be approved by the Senate.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as all of our colleagues and most of America know, tragedy has struck once again in Northern Ireland with the untimely deaths of three young Catholic boys--Richard, Mark, and Jason Quinn. The Quinn brothers were burned to death early Sunday morning after their home was firebombed by Protestant extremists. I join with Prime Ministers Blair and Ahern, President Clinton and others in condemning this terrorist act. I also want to extend, and I am sure I am joined in this by all our colleagues, my deepest condolences to the Quinn family. 
The murder of three innocent children is such a cowardly act that it is incomprehensible. Sadly though for those of us who watched the week-long escalation of violence, after members of the Orange Order were prevented from going forward with a controversial parade through the Catholic neighborhoods, the outcome was predictable. Ironically, the Quinn family had absolutely nothing to do with the standoff between members of the Protestant Orange Order and the Catholic neighborhood of Garvaghy Road over whether a controversial parade route would be followed or whether some compromise plan could be devised. Far too often disputes in Northern Ireland has produced innocent victims--many of them children, and it occurred again on Sunday night. 
Prime Minister Tony Blair and Northern Ireland's political leaders have called for a halt to the current protest at Drumcree to permit a period of reflection with respect to recent events. I believe that members of the Orange Order should accede to that request. Was the dispute over parade routes really worth the lives of three young boys? I do not believe it was, nor do vast majority of the people of Northern Ireland. It is time for Protestant and Catholic community leaders to put aside their excuses for not having a face to face dialogue. Only they are capable of fashioning a compromise on matters that divide them. Only they can end the senseless violence that threatens to destroy the very foundation of the Northern Ireland Peace Agreement before it even has a chance to become fully operational. 
Mr. President, The Good Friday Peace Accords were strongly supported by the majority of Northern Ireland's Catholics and Protestants in the May referendum. The agreement contains a workable plan for getting to the root causes of decades of sectarian conflict, but it must be given a fair chance to produce results. The most recent tragedy in Central Belfast has tested the resolve of Northern Ireland's political leaders to stay the course of peace. I hope they will remain resolute in support of peace. I pray as well that no more sons or daughters of Northern Ireland parents lose their lives as a result of sectarian terrorism. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, I see my colleague from Ohio here, I want to add my voice to those who have spoken in praise of Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the committee, his staff, and the wonderful job they did in leading this piece of legislation and working with Senator Kennedy as the leading Democrat on our side. 
What we witnessed today is a wonderful example of how the legislative process ought to work. It is hard to imagine taking on a piece of legislation that has a 5-year lifespan to it, a higher education bill that affects so many millions of Americans. We did this in one day in large measure because the committee worked very closely together, Mr. President. A lot of work went into trying to resolve issues as a committee. There were a couple we couldn't, so we left those to our colleagues, which is the way it should be here when you can't come to a final resolution. 
That shows remarkable leadership on the part of the chairman and the ranking Democrat, that they can take a bill as complicated and as comprehensive as this, one as long in duration as this and bring it to the floor and, in the space of virtually 12 hours, provide the kind of unanimous--it may have been unanimous, I don't know what the vote was here--almost unanimous vote in support of the Higher Education Act for our Nation. 
I want others to know that this is a good example of how we ought to work here. I hope others will heed this example. 
For Dan Coats, who is not on the floor this evening, our colleague from Indiana, this will be the last higher education bill he will be involved in, as he made the decision to leave the U.S. Senate at the end of his term. Certainly, there will be other bills between now and when the session ends. I am certain Senator Coats feels a sense of pride, as he should, having played a major role in the last higher education bill he will be involved in in the U.S. Senate. I commend him for his efforts. 
Let me join in commending staff: Mark Powden for his fine work, Susan Hattan, Scott Giles, Jenny Smulson, Corey Heyman. 
Senator Kennedy's staff: Marianna Pierce did a wonderful job on the Democratic side working on this and keeping us well informed and trying to work out amendments during the committee process and on the floor. 
Jennifer Kron and Jane Oates did a wonderful job, as did Townsend Lange from Senator Coats' staff. And you will all understand why I pay a special tribute to Suzanne Day of my office who does a fabulous job on these issues, and has for many, many years. She was joined this year by a new member of our staff who did a terrific job, Megan Murray, who is here with us on the floor this evening. I want to thank her, as well, for the tremendous effort she put into making this a successful bill. 
So, Mr. President, I commend our colleagues, and staff particularly, for really doing a very, very fine job. And in these days of acrimony and partisanship and invective behavior, it is wonderful to know there are examples of where this institution shines and shows its best. It did so under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, one hundred and fifty years ago this month, a remarkable group of women and men came together and wrote the single most important document of the nineteenth-century American women's movement and one of the most important writings of American freedom: The Seneca Falls Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions. Modeled closely after the Declaration of Independence, this document is a declaration of women's independence. Radical at the time, it expounded such ideas as allowing women to vote, to become educated, and to participate in economic activities. 
I believe we should take the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Seneca falls convention to celebrate and focus on the rich and courageous history of American women and their struggle for equality. With this in mind, I am introducing the Women's Progress Commemoration Act. 
I am very happy to be joined in introducing this legislation by my primary cosponsor, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, and the bipartisan group of 17 other original cosponsors: Senators Moynihan and D'Amato from New York, Senator Kennedy, Senator Torricelli, Senator Lieberman, Senator Daschle, Senator Collins, Senator Landrieu, Senator Reid, Senator DeWine, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Mikulski, Senator Boxer, Senator Snowe, Senator Murray, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Lautenberg. 
This legislation will establish a commission to identify sites that have been instrumental in the women's movement and help to ensure their historic preservation. The history of American women has barely begun to be recorded. Consider these facts: (1) less than 5 percent of our Nation's historic landmarks chronicle women's achievements, (2) right here in the capitol, of the 197 statues exhibited in statuary hall, only seven are of women leaders, (3) according to a recent study, less than 2 percent of even our contemporary history textbooks are dedicated to women's contributions. 
And yet, despite the virtual infancy of efforts to record women's history, we are doing even less to preserve the places where that history was made. That is why this bill is so important. If we don't preserve our past, we can lose our way into our future and our opportunity to teach not only girls and women but all students and citizens. 
As I stand here today, numerous buildings and structures of deep historical significance to the American women's movement are in a state of disrepair--they have peeling paint, flooded basements, and structural deficiencies. 
For example, the Sewall-Belmont House, just a block from the Capitol, was and still is the headquarters of the National Women's Party, which pressed for woman suffrage. This building was also the residency of Alice Paul, the legendary founder of this party. This is a prime example of a critical site in American women's history that is in need of preservation. Unfortunately, this house is plagued with water problems, deteriorating electrical wiring, and weather-damaged parts of the structure. 
As we can see, I brought these two photographs, Mr. President, to indicate the condition of the Sewall Belmont Home, which I said is about a block from the Capitol and a house that many of my colleagues have visited over the years. This historic house is where some of the treasures of the women's suffrage movement are located and, sadly, as you can see in these pictures, the house is in desperate need of restoration. Even though, I am happy to report that efforts have begun by the Senate to save this house, there are many more examples of such sites throughout the country that are literally crumbling way. 
Another example of a site in need of repair is the McClintock House in the Women's Rights Historical Park in upstate New York. This is where the actual Declaration of Sentiments was drafted during the Seneca Falls Convention. 
Another site that the commission could choose would be the Rankin Ranch in Helena, Montana--the home of the first woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Or perhaps the Harriet Tubman home in Auburn, New York, which is already open to the public but still needs financial support. 
This commission will highlight sites throughout the country, such as these, that deserve to be preserved. 
In my home State of Connecticut there are some success stories of efforts to preserve women's sites such as the Prudence Crandall home, the first school for African-American girls in this country, or the home of Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of `Uncle Tom's Cabin.' 
Even though my State of Connecticut has been progressive about the preservation of women's sites, unfortunately, some of these efforts were too late. Sadly, some historic women's sites in Connecticut were not preserved and are relegated to a signpost or a plaque rather than a museum. 
Hopefully, 150 years after the birth of the women's movement we can create more museums and fewer plaques. 
Let me take a moment to explain very briefly the structure and goals of the commission. The commission will have 15 members appointed by the majority and minority leaders of the Senate and the House and by the administration. Members will be selected based on a knowledge of women's history and historical preservation. Not later than 1 year after the commission's initial meeting it will provide to the Secretary of the Interior a list of sites deserving recognition and preservation. It will also recommend actions to rehabilitate those sites. Thirty days after the submission of this report, the commission will cease to exist. The commission will not fund preservation but rather highlight the need, and hopefully the publicity will generate funds--whether it be private, public, or nonprofit--that would be used to help in the preservation of these sites. 
I hope that the sites across this Nation that signify important points in women's history or celebrate remarkable women will be preserved for the public to come and learn. I hope that school children across our Nation will be making field trips to historic women's sites, along with their trips to the White House, the Capitol, Monticello, and the significant memorials here in this city and across our Nation. 
Let's make women's contributions to our history known to generations yet unborn--their accomplishments an inspiration and their homes and workplaces opportunities where future generations can come and learn. 
In July of 1848 the Seneca Falls Convention convened to consider the social conditions and civil rights of women. As I have said, this convention signaled the beginning of an admirable and courageous women's movement in this Nation. Today, for the 150th anniversary of this historic meeting, let us take the opportunity to preserve and teach the contributions of women to our Nation's history to future generations of Americans.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference report for H.R. 2676, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. I commend my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee, namely Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan for crafting a bill that takes an important step forward in the effort to protect the rights of our nation's taxpayers. 
The IRS is an agency that has earned widespread, deeply felt, and entirely justified criticism. For too long the IRS has permitted practices that harass rather than help taxpayers. In my view, a full-scale, top-to-bottom overhaul of this agency is long overdue. 
Recent Congressional hearings have chronicled a litany of official neglect, heavy-handed threats, and outright abuse of innocent citizens. Clearly, Mr. President, no one likes to pay taxes. But that duty should not be made even more difficult by the unacceptable behavior of the agency responsible for collecting those taxes. 
Many of my constituents in Connecticut have sought assistance from my office in their efforts to remedy what they feel is unhelpful, unpleasant, and at times unfair treatment by officers of the IRS. 
I heard from one gentleman who went to the IRS to pay several hundred dollars he owed in back taxes--only to be handed a tax bill that, with penalties and interest, totaled upwards of $30,000. Other Connecticut residents have told me stories of the IRS losing their tax payments--and then charging them interest and penalties on the very funds that the agency lost. They have told of calling the IRS and finding it impossible to locate a person who will simply answer their questions. 
The list goes on and on, Mr. President, and the more people you talk to, the more nightmares you hear. The problems at the IRS, however, go far beyond the actions of a few agents at the IRS. For years, the agency has fostered a climate where taxpayers feel scorned rather than served, and that is why the IRS reform legislation before us today is so important. 
This legislation contains more than 50 new taxpayer rights and protections. Most importantly, it will shift the burden of proof away from the taxpayer and onto the IRS. Today, when someone is accused of a crime like bank robbery, they're presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. Yet, if the IRS says you didn't pay enough taxes, you're presumed guilty until proven innocent. That, Mr. President, is wrong. 
For too long we've seen a `shoot first, ask questions later' approach to enforcement by the IRS. By shifting the burden of proof, this bill will require that the IRS prove its allegations with evidence. It will help ensure that the IRS exercises appropriate caution and consideration prior to commencing an enforcement action against any taxpayer. 
This reform bill also protects people from paying penalties and interest that they should never have been required to pay. Under current law, taxpayers must pay penalties and interest whether or not they knew that back taxes are due. As a result, some taxpayers were assessed hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in fines without ever having actually been told by the IRS that money was owed. This bill suspends penalties if the taxpayer has not been appropriately notified of the debt. It also requires that each penalty notice include a computation itemizing the penalties or interest due. It's only fair that a taxpayer should have adequate notice of any financial liability and know exactly why he or she is paying a fine. 
The bill also offers relief to an innocent spouse who would otherwise become liable for his or her ex-spouse's tax obligations. I'm sure that many of my colleagues have heard stories similar to those I've heard in Connecticut, about people who have become financially wiped out when they find themselves liable for taxes, interest, and penalties because of actions by their then-spouse of which they were unaware. The innocent spouse provisions of the bill would help prevent such scenarios from occurring in the future. It's a matter of simple fairness: a spouse who did not know of an ex-spouse's misdeeds should not be held liable for them. 
In addition, this legislation requires the IRS Commissioner to fire employees for certain egregious violations--especially those that mistreat taxpayers. This provision will send a clear message to agency employees that neglect and abuse of taxpayers will simply not be tolerated. 
Lastly, the bill contains a modest tax cut for people who own stocks, bonds, and other assets. I don't object to this provision itself. I do, however, wish that the Congress had considered additional tax relief targeted to working families--such as expanding the child care tax credit. I hope that such relief will be on the Congressional agenda in the future. 
I would be remiss if I did not comment about the fact that the conferees added a title to this conference report containing the technical corrections to the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, which was signed into law several weeks ago. 
That law contains a provision affecting Veterans Administration benefits for veterans with smoking-related illnesses. I was concerned that by adopting these technical corrections in the IRS conference report, we would lose a valuable opportunity to restore some or all of these benefits for deserving veterans. 
It is well known that during their time of active service, many of these individuals received free cigarettes from the federal government and were thereby encouraged to smoke. As a result, many of these individuals developed smoking-related illnesses. For that reason, I supported Senator Murray's motion to remove this extraneous title from the legislation we considered today. Unfortunately, this motion was tabled by a vote of 50 to 48. It is my hope, however, that the Senate will continue to seek ways to ensure that the government fulfills its obligation to help veterans with smoking-related ailments. 
Overall, Mr. President, I am very pleased to support the legislation before us today which enjoys broad, bipartisan support. In my view, it is a tremendous step forward in our effort to protect the rights of our nation's taxpayers. Our nation's taxpayers deserve an IRS that meets the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and courtesy. This legislation takes a major step forward in achieving that goal.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Alan H. `Bud' Selig, on his unanimous selection today to serve as baseball's ninth permanent commissioner. 
Alan `Bud' Selig is a very good friend of mine. 
Admittedly today's announcement is somewhat anti-climactic as Bud Selig's tenure has already surpassed that of four of his eight predecessors as commissioner. But this is truly a special day and a great accomplishment for a deserving and wonderful American. 
Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin and Bud were college classmates. Most college classmates would consider it a great success if later in life they were to share season tickets to a ballpark. This was a unique college roommate relationship in that both of them ended up being owners of major league franchises within their own city. 
I must admit that I can think of few college rooming groups in our Nation's history who have attained such success. Most roommates simply aspire to one day share a set of season-tickets, but for each roommate to own one of the home town professional sports teams must surely be unprecedented. 
While Bud may be an owner, he has always remained first and foremost, a fan, and that is why I think that he has been and will continue to be a successful commissioner. He understands the power of the game and the joy and disappointment that it can deliver to its fans. 
Bud, you have an important job ahead of you, and some large footsteps that you must walk in. But I have every confidence that you will serve in a manner worthy of the position and its history. Congratulations. 
When Milwaukee joined the major leagues in 1953, Bud became a Braves fan and subsequently the largest public stockholder in 1963. But he saw his beloved Braves move to Atlanta in 1965 and he then sold his stock. 
But in recognition of the importance of baseball to the city, Bud formed an organization to bring baseball back to Milwaukee. After several heartbreaking failures Bud was successful in 1970 when a Seattle bankruptcy court awarded the Seattle franchise to the investment group led by Bud Selig, and the modern-day Milwaukee Brewers were born. 
Bud has led the Brewers since the move to Milwaukee, and has upon his selection as commissioner placed his interest in a trust. His daughter Wendy is currently serving as the president of the club. 
Not only is Bud an asset to the game of baseball, but he is a pillar in his community. He is a member of the board of the Green Bay Packers football team and the University of Wisconsin medical school. He was a founder of athletes for youth, helped establish the child abuse prevention network and serves on the board for businesses against drunk driving. He is also a trustee of the Boys and Girls Club. 
From the day that he took the reigns of baseball's executive council he has been faced with serious and difficult issues. He presided over the 230-day strike that wiped out the World Series for the first time in 90 years and led to a sharp drop-off in attendance and popularity. But eventually, he was able to help secure a new collective bargaining agreement with the players association, and the game has been moving in the right direction ever since. 
Bud Selig has implemented a number of changes to the game that have been overwhelmingly popular with baseball's fans. 
As a Red Sox fan, I want to personally thank the commissioner for implementing the popular wild card system. When I look in the sports pages today to check the standings, I don't see Boston as being 11 games out of first place. Instead, I see them with a five game lead in the wild card race. For that, I and much of New England thank the new commissioner. 
He has also instigated interleague play that has brought tremendous excitement to cities all across America. For years, the Yankees-Mets or Cubs-White Sox debate took place in bar rooms and diners, but today it's taking place on the baseball diamond, where it should be. 
Thanks to Bud Selig's leadership, baseball fans are no longer talking about labor programs. Instead they're talking about the quest to surpass Roger Maris's 61 home runs or Hack Wilson's RBI record. They're talking about whether or not the Yankees can break the record for most wins in a season. They're talking about the playoff hopes of the Red Sox and the Mets. And not only are they talking about baseball, but they're also going to the ball park, as major league attendance has almost completely returned to its pre-strike levels. 
Today's vote is a testament to the job that Bud had done as interim commissioner. When he took the post in a temporary role in 1992, few people would have ever imagined that an owner could be approved as full-time commissioner. But Bud Selig is a commissioner for the future of baseball, and he will continue doing an admirable job tackling the problems of the modern game. 
Perhaps the biggest problems facing baseball today is the dichotomy between rich and poor teams. And few Commissioners could be as uniquely well-suited to address this issue. As the owner of a small-market team Bud Selig understands the difficulties that the Milwaukees and Montreals of the world have going up against teams like the Braves and the Yankees. 
He was instrumental in securing a revenue-sharing agreement between large and small market teams, and I am confident that he will continue seeking ways to address this issue. 
In addition to a valuable perspective, Bud Selig also possesses the leadership skills and demeanor that will be necessary to take baseball into the next century. He's a far cry from the iron-fist of Judge Kinnesaw Mountain Landis. Instead, Bud Selig rules by consensus, and his consensus building skills will help him provide the unified leadership that will keep baseball on the right track as it heads into the 21st century. 
On a personal note, I want to thank Bud Selig for his efforts to help expedite the move of the Yankees double-A farm team to Norwich, Connecticut. This ball club has played in Norwich for a few years now, and it has really helped to bring that community even closer together. They play in a beautiful ball park, that I'm proud to say is named after my father--Senator Thomas Dodd. The dedication of that stadium and the playing of the first minor league game in Norwich was a special day for me, and Bud Selig took the time from his busy schedule to spend that day with me and the people of Connecticut. And for that, I am thankful. 
So our deep and sincere congratulations to Bud. 
In closing, I would like to read a passage from one of Bud Selig's predecessors that highlights the significance of the job that he has just taken. 
A former Connecticut resident who served as commissioner of baseball, A. Bartlett Giamatti, who passed away, former president of Yale University, wrote: 
I believe baseball is a beautiful and exciting game, loved by millions--I among them--and I believe baseball an important, enduring American institution. It must assert and aspire to the highest principles--of integrity, of professionalism of performance, of fair play within its rules. It will come as no surprise that like any institution composed of human beings, this institution will not always fulfill its highest aspirations. I know of no worldly institution that does but this one, because it is so much a part of our history as a people, and because it has such a penchant on our national soul, has an obligation to the people for whom it is played to, its fans, and well-wishers to strive for excellence in all things to promote the highest ideals. I am told that I am an idealist. I hope so. I will continue to locate ideals I hold for myself and my country in the national game as well as in others of our national institutions. 
`Bud' Selig, I think, embraces those thoughts that Bartlett Giamatti expressed some years ago before his untimely and early death. I am very confident that we will all be proud of his tenure as commissioner of baseball. 
I wanted to take this moment to congratulate `Bud' Selig and his family this evening. It is a proud night for them, and certainly it is a good night for baseball and for America as well.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, There are few pieces of legislation as important to American families as the bill we take up today--the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. 
I have been pleased and honored to work with the chairman and the ranking member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and with Senator Coats of Indiana to put this bill together over the last year. I appreciate the tremendous effort of Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy and Senator Coats on this bill, which is going to move I think rather expeditiously. There will be some amendments, but it is a tribute to the efforts of the membership of this group and their staff that we have reached a point where we have this very, very important piece of legislation that has achieved as much harmony as it has. So I begin these brief remarks by commending them and the staff members who have put this bill together. And, together, we bring to the floor today a strong, bipartisan bill--a bill that American families need and deserve. 
Mr. President, America has long been known as the land of promise. We take great pride in that as Americans. Those words are used at every national holidays--`a land of promise.' I think the foundation of that promise has been, during the more than two centuries of our existence as a nation, education. A democracy as complicated, as sophisticated, and as subtle as ours could not succeed without an educated population. Education is also the root of our economic strength. Without an educated population, you cannot remain on the cutting edge of industry and business. 
I think any successful national endeavor you talk about, Education is a critical factor in its success. It is the central theme that has created the kind of opportunity and success this Nation has enjoyed for so many years--particularly, I would add, higher education. This is no secret. Parents recognize that their child's success is, in no small measure, dependent on his or her educational achievement. Statistics bear this out. A person with a college degree earns twice as much as one with just a high school education. 
But this issue is not only a concern of families. Higher education has also, as I said a moment ago, defined and shaped America's economy in the post-World War II era. Our economy has grown on the strength of knowledge-based, highly skilled industries and workers. This would not have been possible without our unparalleled network of universities and colleges and our Federal commitment to ensuring access to these institutions of higher learning. 
Since the GI bill, millions of Americans have been able to attend college because of the assistance of their Federal Government. Today, in fact, 75 percent of all student aid is Federal. 
Unfortunately, families increasingly worry that college is slipping beyond their grasp as college costs rise and student debt mounts. Studies suggest that even with the nearly $35 billion of Federal aid available each year, affordability is a significant factor for those at all income levels. For middle-income families, college costs are shaping students' decisions about where to attain their higher education and what type of careers they intend to pursue. For the neediest of students in our country, affordability of education is already affecting the fundamental decision of whether to attend higher education at all. 
We cannot discuss the Higher Education Act, which is centrally about ensuring access to higher education, without discussing cost. I firmly believe that the choice of an institution, the choice of a career, and the choice of whether to attend college at all should not be based alone on the issue of cost--and for too many families today, it is. 
Let's face it. Families are increasingly unable to cope with the cost increases that we see in higher education. According to a survey conducted by the American Council on Education, the public worries a great deal about the cost of attending college. They believe that college is too expensive, and they think that the cost can be brought down without affecting academic quality. 
When asked what concerned them most about their children's well-being, respondents across this country in all income groups ranked paying for college as the second biggest concern. Their largest concern was use of illegal drugs. But right behind that was the cost of a higher education. 
Today, 4 years at one of our Nation's leading colleges can easily total well over $120,000. Estimates are that the family of a child born today who might enter college at age 18 in the year 2016 could easily be looking at a cost of well over $250,000 for 4 years of college education at one of our nation's leading universities. In nearly all families, a letter offering financial aid is as, if not more, important than the actual letter of accepting the student into the college of their choice. 
In the last 20 years, from 1977 to 1997, college costs--tuition, room and board--rose by an astounding 304 percent. During the same period, inflation rose by roughly half that figure, 165 percent. Let's look at just the tuition over the last 10 years. 
Mr. President, I want to refer to a chart that will maybe help explain this a bit more graphically. As this chart indicates, while inflation between 1987 and 1996 rose by 38 percent, public 4-year college education rose 132 percent; private 4-year institutions went up 99 percent; and public 2-year institution's cost rose 85 percent. 
Again, I come back to the Consumer Price Index. It went up 38 percent, and yet you see in tuition and fees rose at a significantly higher rate in every area of higher education, public and private, 2- and 4-year institutions as well. 
As a result of these increases in the price of attending college, more and more students and families are going into debt in order to finance postsecondary education. 
We take the first important steps in this bill, in my view, to make sure that the serious problem of rising college costs does not create a new class of haves and have-nots in terms of access to 
 postsecondary education. 
In particular, we have adopted many of the recommendations of the Cost of College Commission formed by Congress last year. We streamlined regulatory requirements that may contribute to those costs. Most importantly, we adopted strong new disclosure requirements to assist families and policymakers with cost issues. 
Mr. President, let me tell you, we come back year after year to this bill and this issue. And we do what I think we ought to do--we increase the financing for Pell grants, which has been of tremendous help to millions; we try to deal with student loan issues and make these necessary burdens easier to bear. 
The Senator from Massachusetts, who knows this as well as anyone in this chamber, will tell you that he recalls it was not that many years ago when we had, in overall terms, 80 percent of our aid in grants; most students did not acquire debt as well as a diploma. We assisted students because we thought it was the right thing to do; there was a direct investment coming back. And 20 percent of our assistance to students was in the form of loans. 
Today, those numbers are reversed. Students now rely on loans for over 80 percent of their aid. And so we come back each year. We get involved in the student aid issue, the Pell grant issue, a lot of other factors. At some point, we have to come back to these institutions and say: Look, how does it happen? How is it that the Consumer Price Index goes up 38 percent and yet your public 4-year institution has risen 132 percent in the same 10-year period, in 20 years up 304 percent, as opposed to a CPI number of 165 percent? 
We can't come back here every 5 years and continue to monkey around with the student loan issue and to continue to try to come up with ways to meet the needs here as we watch debt accumulate and students making the choice to not go to college. We are seeing that today with a lot of needy students. They just decide they can't take on the financial burden. What a great outrage, what a great loss to all of us. 
So I am not suggesting there is any simple answer to this question, but one of the things that I like so much about this bill we have put together is that we are going to take a really hard look at this for the first time. This is not to suggest there may be some very clear answers as to why costs are rising. But this bill will finally help answer this central question. 
We take several specific steps in the key area. First, our bill ensures that families will have the information they need to become good consumers when it comes to higher education. Today, you may be able to find cost figures for different institutions, but often times they don't match up and are hard to compare. The American Council on Education survey also revealed that the public does not know how much financial aid is available to help pay college bills, where it does come from, or how to get it. 
These new disclosure provisions will provide families with timely, reliable, and comparable information on college costs as well as the availability of financial aid and educational loans for students who attend each institution so that they can exercise their power as consumers to choose institutions that are of high quality and of reasonable cost. 
Secondly, Mr. President, the bill requires new information for policymakers on costs, including trends across and within sectors. Over the next few years, the National Center for Education Statistics will conduct a national study to examine how expenditures at institutions of higher education change over time, how such expenditures relate to college costs and ultimately the price of tuition for students. This study will attempt to explain why the price to obtain a higher education for each student has increased so much faster than the price for the institutions to provide an education for each student. Let me explain it in this chart here, if I can. From 1987-1997, the price for a public institution to instruct each student increased by 57 percent, but during that same period of time the price for each student to attend a public institution increased by 132 percent. 
It is critical that this grave disparity be explained before policy makers can adequately address the issue of containing college costs. 
Finally, we ask the Bureau of Labor Statistics to establish a market basket for higher education that will finally give us some clue as to what costs are reasonable. 
These are crucial first steps that will help fill the knowledge gap on cost. But we must make sure these disclosure provisions work. The committee adopted an amendment that I offered to ensure that there are strong enforcement tools, such as a $25,000 fine to ensure that institutions cooperate in providing accurate information. Again, I don't have any reason to believe they won't. I am confident these institutions will want to participate in this kind of analysis. But just in case there are some who are reluctant, a little incentive is not a bad idea. 
These provisions on college costs put colleges on notice that we are watching and we are not going to let pricing policies put college beyond the reach of too many Americans. It is far too important to them and, quite candidly, as has been said before, it is vitally important to all of us in this Nation. 
This legislation also strengthens Federal financial aid programs which are lifelines to families who struggle with cost increases. We authorize an increase in the maximum Pell grant award and hope the appropriators and the budget committees will follow through with adequate funds. We also adjust the treatment of the neediest students' earnings to ensure that their families are not penalized in the award of aid because the students work, as I recommended in earlier legislation. We also expand campus-based aid programs like College Work-Study and low-cost Perkins Loans, to reach more students. We improve Federal student loan programs, providing extended repayment periods for students with large loan balances and by giving colleges more tools to help their students avoid expensive loans. 
Most significantly, students are also guaranteed a substantially lower student loan interest rate. As the average debt of a student mounts to nearly $12,000 on average across the country, the relief that this nearly 1 point reduction in interest rates offers should not be undervalued. Again, I commend the chairman and the ranking Democrat, Senator Kennedy, for being leaders on this issue and making a difference here that is going to save each student borrower in my State an average of $640. It could mean as much as $3,200 to those students who borrow for graduate and professional degrees. But for a family trying to make ends meet, $650 a year for a student loan is a lot of money. This will make a big, big difference. 
Not surprisingly, the issue of student loan interest rate has been the most controversial and closely followed issue in this bill. I am very pleased that the solution we put forward today ensures that students will receive the long-term benefit substantially lower rates. However, I am disappointed that this bill expects taxpayers to bear much of the cost with a new subsidy to banks. I am unsure whether subsidizing the banks' returns on student loans is ultimately the best way to ensure affordability for our nation's students. 
The legislation also takes important steps to address the needs of non-traditional students, whose participation in higher education is rising at an impressive rate. 
We include new authority for the Secretary to explore the potential of distance learning. In the past, distance education too often meant correspondence courses with little merit and high cost. Today, the Internet, the World Wide Web and other emerging technologies offer new opportunities for quality, interactive learning right from a student's home. However, current law provides little opportunity for institutions and their students to explore these exciting opportunities. This bill broadly expands these opportunities and directs the Secretary to undertake and carefully monitor a demonstration program in distance education. I think this provision will be vitally important in meeting the needs of nontraditional students pursuing higher education. 
The bill also includes another important initiative to increase access to post-secondary education--the Child Care Access Means Parents in Schools Act, which I authored with Senator Snowe. This bill will support campus-based child care centers meeting the needs of those nontraditional students who have children of their own. The face of college has changed. One of the key obstacles many of today's students face is locating affordable, quality child care. Campuses are a key place to meet this need. In Connecticut--I am sure it is true across the country--when you visit good college campuses, you find they build child care centers right into the campus design. This initiative will help strengthen these efforts and expand the reach of these critical programs. 
Finally, this bill addresses the training of teachers. Colleges, of course, are our Nation's laboratories for teachers. This bill offers significant new support in this area. We have all worked hard to resolve the competing concerns and differing approaches, and the result, I believe, is a strong, comprehensive teacher training program that support state level initiatives and local partnerships. This two-track approach will ensure that colleges and schools that work together to improve teacher training will be rewarded at the state level with recognition for achieving higher standards. In another important initiative for teachers, this bill offers loan forgiveness for teachers working in high poverty schools. This effort will provide high qualified teachers with a powerful incentive to share their talents, skills and knowledge with the neediest children. 
Beyond bringing student aid programs in line with today's realities, we take a key step to modernize and to improve the crucial student aid programs with the creation of a Performance-Based Organization within the Department of Education. This office will administer and deliver all Federal student aid. At nearly $35 billion a year, the complexity of this undertaking demands talent, energy, experience, and performance. This PBO, this Performance-Based Organization, will, I believe, ensure the Secretary of Education can recruit the best people for this job and retain them based on their performance. 
It is not a perfect bill. That probably has been said by others. But it really is a very sound effort to deal with cost and shore up federal financial assistance, to deal with the issue of the nontraditional students, and to deal with the issue of teaching in our country. It sets us on the right road for the 21st century--putting in place strong federal policy to help make the promise of higher education a reality for more American families.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. 
Let me join in the chorus of praise of our distinguished colleagues from Kentucky and Delaware, who have worked out this arrangement to allow for the adoption of this resolution that will permit the sale of food shipments to go forward in the case of both Pakistan and India. 
I also want to take a moment here to commend our colleague from Indiana, who is no longer in the Chamber, but who went beyond the particular legislation in front of us and suggested that there are a number of things we need to be doing on the international level if we are going to continue to have the kind of success economically at home that we have enjoyed over these past several years. 
The critical elements, of ensuring success at home economically over the long term are that we have a sound education policy, an issue which we have been debating today as part of the higher education reauthorization legislation, in addition to the obvious sound monetary and economic policy. Another important component is to also have responsible global economic policies. Certainly enactment of IMF legislation is a critical element of such a policy. I am hopeful that the other body will follow the Senate in passing the IMF legislation before we adjourn this Fall. 
Sanctions policy is another part of our global economic policy that certainly demands our attention in this Congress and in this session. I think most Members now have come to the conclusion that our present sanctions policy is not only not working very well, but is actually counter to our own self-interest. 
Someone suggested the other day that when we adopt unilateral sanctions, what we ought to do is immediately lay off about 5 percent of the workforce in the affected industries, because that is the ultimate effect and we should be honest about it. 
Senator Hagel, Senator Pat Roberts, Senator Biden, and I, and others introduced legislation before the July 4 recess would fundamentally change how unilateral sanctions are dealt with in this country. I would restore the appropriate balance of power between the Congress and the Executive in the sanctions area by giving the President the authority to delay, suspend, or terminate a particular sanction if he believes it serves an important national interest to do so. But we are not going to debate that today or bring it up, but I am hopeful that before this session ends we will find the time to do so. 
I am fearful that while there is a keen interest in the sanctions issue now because of recent events in Pakistan and India, we will soon move on to other things without fundamentally addressing the problems with sanctions that the India/Pakistan highlighted so vividly. I hope that doesn't happen. 
We currently have in place sanctions that effect more than 40% of the world's population. In one year alone, existing sanctions has cost the United States $20 billion in lost export revenues and affected 200,000 jobs in America. And even if you did not pass one new sanction, that $20 billion turns into $100 billion over a five year period, and those 200,000 jobs turn into a million. 
So I am hopeful that this interest being expressed today by both Democrats and Republicans on this particular issue--and they have gone beyond it to suggest we need to fundamentally change how we impose unilateral sanctions--will bear fruit in terms of some broader legislative steps before this Congress expires.

Mr. DODD. This amendment has been cleared by both sides. What it does is, to exempt the sale of medicines and medical equipment from sanctions that would be imposed under this provision of the Arms Export Control Act. Senator Warner, Senator Hagel, Senator Robb, and I feel that just as food should not be used as a weapon against other countries, neither should medicine or medical equipment. 
I have heard it said now countless times over the last hour and a half or 2 hours on this floor that food shipments ought never to be used as an instrument of sanctions policy. Whatever else we may choose to do to sanction a government, we shouldn't be hurting the average person in that country because they aren't responsible for the actions of their leaders. We shouldn't be victimizing innocent men, women and children with our sanctions policy. 
I guarantee you that the political leaders who formulate policies of countries get their flu shots, get their medicine; they get their food. It is the general population who are the innocent victims who suffer. So we wanted to add medicine and medical equipment to make a point today, to put them on the same footing as food shipment are treated in this bill, so that we would begin to set the precedent that food shipments and medicine will no longer be used as a tool of our sanctions policy. Our ultimate goal is to lift all sanctions on the sale of food and medicine that currently are included in existing law, and bar the imposition of any future sanctions of this kind. We hope we will accomplish this broader objective before Congress adjourns later this year. But that goes beyond the parameters of the legislation that is being considered today. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in correcting what is clearly an unintended consequence of Congressional enacted sanctions--namely preventing American farmers from being able to export their products abroad. This not only hurts American farm families, but it also ends up hurting innocent populations who in many cases are terribly dependent on American food stuffs in order to stay alive. Moreover, it is unlikely to alter the behavior of the sanctioned government. 
I do not believe that food should ever be used as a weapon against other governments or people. That is not what the United States should be about. The American people have an enormous humanitarian spirit always reaching to help the weak and defenseless. Surely there are enough weapons in our foreign policy arsenal that we can forswear the use of food as a sanctions tool. 
Similarly, I believe that we should also forswear denying life saving medicines and medical equipment to innocent women and children, simply because we don't like something their government officials may have done. Let's not kid ourselves into thinking we are denying any high government officials access to all the food or medicine they need--they'll get it even though there is scarcity with respect to the general public. 
I am pleased that the Managers have agreed to accept the Dodd/Warner amendment that amends the Arms Export Control Act to make it explicitly clear that medicines and medical supplies will not be withheld under the sanctions provisions of this act. 
When we impose sanctions against other governments we are at the same time sending a signal to the rest of the world about what the United States stands for and believes in. For that reason I believe we should never be telling the world that we believe in starving innocent people or denying them access to medical care. It is important that throughout the planet everyone understands that the United States operates only on the highest moral standards and will never stoop to the kind of behavior that is the hallmark of petty dictatorships who care nothing for the well being of their people. 
Mr. President, while I support what we are doing today, I do not believe it goes far enough. It does not resolve the problem that currently confronts the President with respect to sanctions generally and India and Pakistan most immediately. We have done nothing today to give him the flexibility he needs to bring India and Pakistan back within the fold of internationally responsible countries in the realm of nuclear nonproliferation. I would hope that we could get agreement to deal with this issue very quickly so that a bad situation does not become a global tragedy.

Mr. DODD. I think this proposal is a step in that direction. It makes sense. It deserves our broad-based support. I strongly urge our colleagues to join with us on the broader efforts to fundamentally change sanctions policy. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from Minnesota for this amendment. I think it is a very thoughtful amendment, one that I think most Americans would feel very comfortable in backing and supporting. 
There was a significant debate, as we all recall, in this Chamber not that many months ago on the issue of welfare reform, and the desire to have people who collect public assistance find meaningful work. All of us supported the underlying principle of that concept. There were disagreements on how it should be achieved and on final passage of the bill. But the underlying desire to move people from welfare to work was certainly a laudable goal. 
What our colleague is suggesting here is that a person on welfare who enters an educational program to learn skills and training--that education experience ought to be considered on a par with a work experience. For persons acquiring skills and trying to improve the quality of their life, to enhance their opportunities, I think that ought to be applauded and encouraged. If a person is engaged in that effort here, certainly that individual deserves our support and backing. A person who acquires skills is going to be a person who will earn that income that will make him or herself independent, a good provider at home, a better citizen. All of us know of the vital importance of education. 
I made note earlier in the day that we now know factually that a person who earns a college degree today earns twice the income of a person with only a high school diploma. That was not the case only a few short years ago. A few short years ago, with a high school diploma, a set of good hands and a good heart, you could provide for your family, you could earn a good salary, a good wage, buy a home, educate your children, provide for their health needs. But today that is no longer the case. You have to have more education. 
In my view, if a person who has been on welfare, on public assistance, is entering an educational opportunity, as I said a moment ago, then that ought to be supported. So I strongly urge our colleagues here to support the Wellstone amendment. If there is one thing that we know works to end the cycle of poverty, it is education. A person who has those tools will be in a far better position to not only gain employment, but to remain employed and to understand and support democracy. 
I have often cited this quote, and I can't resist because sitting next to me is our dear friend and colleague from West Virginia. I have often used it and said to my audiences in my home State of Connecticut that Thomas Jefferson understood this concept 200 years ago when he said in a speech--I think I have the quote pretty close--`Any nation that expects to be ignorant and free expects what never was and never can be.' He made those comments at the beginning of the 19th century. We are just a few short days from the end of the 20th century. Certainly, if it was true then, it is true today--that `Any nation that expects to be ignorant and free expects what never was and never can be.' 
As expensive as education is, ignorance is far more costly. We certainly know that people who are dependent on public assistance in most cases are people who lack educational skills. 
To strengthen our country, to create opportunity to improve an individual's chance to succeed in this country, I think the idea should be equating a person who is entering an educational process on the same footing as someone who is entering into a work experience. For those reasons, I support the amendment of our colleagues from Minnesota, and urge adoption of it by a strong vote in this body. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to inquire, I have some questions of my colleague from New Mexico. I have not formulated a final position myself on it. I was listening here to the debate and read some of the material about this. 
First of all, let me say I commend my colleagues from New Mexico and Mississippi. Even having a discussion of how we can improve the quality of our teachers who are working in our elementary and secondary schools is worthy. I compliment the chairman and managers. We do some major things in this bill to really try to assist teaching, such as loan forgiveness for people in the teaching professions, extended payment periods--a lot of things that really try to recognize the value of teachers. 
I see my colleague from Connecticut has arrived on the floor as well. 
I was going back over, in my own State of Connecticut, what criteria we have. On the list, we are listed as one of the States that requires a major. That is true, but only in a limited degree. We require majors in certain subject matters, not in every subject matter. For instance, in languages we do not require that you have a major in a language, English or a foreign language, in order to teach; the assumption being, if you were Hispanic or Latino and had acquired that skill, to major in it would require that you have teaching skills on how to teach the language, but not necessarily require a major in the field. 
We do in other areas. In the science and math areas we do require majors. The general sciences, history, social studies, business, we do require majors; in foreign languages and English we do not. We have a requirement here of a minimum of 30 semester hours of credit in the subject for which endorsement is sought. I don't know whether or not that constitutes a major or not. But it seems, here, we have sort of a mixed approach. 
We have some very fine teachers. Mr. President, 80 percent of our teachers have advanced degrees in Connecticut, and are normally rated as some of the best educated teachers in the country. So my first inquiry would be, I guess, if we do not require majors in every subject matter, would we be subject here? For instance, if someone did not have a major in a language, would Connecticut now have to require a major in that language, or would the 30 semester hours meet the standard? Or would the fact that we do in some and not in others meet the standard? Or would we be faced with having our program dollars cut unless we changed?

Mr. DODD. I appreciate the response on that. I do not 
have an amendment to offer because I don't feel competent to suggest what my State ought to require that there be major studies in. They have excluded certain areas. We require 3 semester hours in certain subject hours, 30 semester hours in others, a major in some and not in others. They have made a decision to have sort of a multiple approach to this thing, a varied approach on it. Far be it from me to stand here this evening and say Connecticut ought to require a major in certain areas where they don't require it. I have enough confidence in the people who have designed the program there to give them some flexibility. 
What I do not want, if I am supporting my colleague's amendment, is to find out if my State loses financial assistance because we have not provided major fields, or required a major in every subject matter although we have in others. Then I would feel remiss in terms of a number of areas. 
As I understand it, you would lose funding in international education, graduate education, funding for historically black colleges and universities, strengthening institutional grants that go to mainly community colleges. I don't want to be in the position, if I vote for this, to go back and find out I have just deprived my State of funding in those areas because the amendment, as crafted, would deny my State those benefits because in some areas majors are not required. That is my concern. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I pointed out earlier, I have not formed a final opinion on it. I raised the question because this was raised to me by my State. I am concerned--and I didn't expect this, so my colleague from New Mexico doesn't have a definitive answer--that there might be some criteria left open to the States to determine whether or not something classifies as major. It is not his intention to say to some State that he thinks falls into this category unwittingly they may be deprived of these funds because we didn't realize certain subject majors were not required. That is my concern. 
I reluctantly may have to vote against the amendment, but I am not enthusiastic about doing it because I like the idea behind it. I think it makes a lot of sense. John Silber, the distinguished former president of Boston University, wrote an article the other day, one of the op-ed pieces in one of our national papers that makes the case. We are turning out people really not qualified to be teaching in our classrooms. 
I am sympathetic to the idea to increase the teacher skills and knowledge base. I want to make sure in doing so, in our enthusiasm for that, we are not doing harmful things along the way. I share the enthusiasm. I share the appetite for it. 
It is almost 8 o'clock here, east coast time. I want to make sure that in voting for something like this I am not saying to 32 States that may have very differing views on what classifies as a major that we have to turn around and undo something here that would otherwise deprive these States of funds they need and are clearly moving in the area of improving content as well as teaching skills. 
I thank my colleague from New Mexico. I will listen to the debate. Maybe there will be something enlightening on this. I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am reluctant to take the time. I am enjoying this going back and forth. I just wanted to add my voice on this. In fact, I think, what the Senator from Indiana may have just proposed, it is unfortunate that it is not in the form of an amendment here. Because I think a pilot program, as one who has supported allowing institutions to make the choices on direct loans and guaranteed loans, that is really the best way to work. Let the marketplace work this out. I would certainly be amenable to such an amendment here. 
I think what the Senator from Massachusetts is proposing and offering here is going to be a great asset to all of us. What we are doing right now is guessing. This is a guessing game, and it need not be a guessing game. So we are being asked arbitrarily here to sort of accept some numbers, disregarding what the larger economic picture is across the country. 
And by establishing this study with a pilot program, we can come back in 5 years. That is when we come back to this issue. In that window we will be in a far better position to make a determination as to what should be those rates and how the marketplace could work. Why shouldn't we take advantage of that? It doesn't lock us into a particular answer one way or the other. It just gives us the opportunity to try to see if we can't come up with a more reliable, predictable solution as to how these rates ought to be determined. 
Given the fact that we hear from the Congressional Budget Office that, under current rates, the banks have earned rates of return on student loans between 16 and 35 percent--by anyone's estimation that is excessive. That is their estimate. Analysts predict that we will lock in generous profits. CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, predicts that the rates of return under the interest rates in the bill will be between 10 and 25 percent. The Treasury Department calculates an average return under the bill of 16 percent. That is really excessive. 
So by allowing a pilot program in the marketplace deciding these factors, we are not allowing a situation that costs taxpayers a tremendous amount. We have done so much here to alleviate some of the pressures for students in this bill, it would be a tragedy not to take advantage of doing something for the taxpayers who underwrite this program. I urge we adopt this amendment.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, I see my colleague from Ohio here, I want to add my voice to those who have spoken in praise of Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the committee, his staff, and the wonderful job they did in leading this piece of legislation and working with Senator Kennedy as the leading Democrat on our side. 
What we witnessed today is a wonderful example of how the legislative process ought to work. It is hard to imagine taking on a piece of legislation that has a 5-year lifespan to it, a higher education bill that affects so many millions of Americans. We did this in one day in large measure because the committee worked very closely together, Mr. President. A lot of work went into trying to resolve issues as a committee. There were a couple we couldn't, so we left those to our colleagues, which is the way it should be here when you can't come to a final resolution. 
That shows remarkable leadership on the part of the chairman and the ranking Democrat, that they can take a bill as complicated and as comprehensive as this, one as long in duration as this and bring it to the floor and, in the space of virtually 12 hours, provide the kind of unanimous--it may have been unanimous, I don't know what the vote was here--almost unanimous vote in support of the Higher Education Act for our Nation. 
I want others to know that this is a good example of how we ought to work here. I hope others will heed this example. 
For Dan Coats, who is not on the floor this evening, our colleague from Indiana, this will be the last higher education bill he will be involved in, as he made the decision to leave the U.S. Senate at the end of his term. Certainly, there will be other bills between now and when the session ends. I am certain Senator Coats feels a sense of pride, as he should, having played a major role in the last higher education bill he will be involved in in the U.S. Senate. I commend him for his efforts. 
Let me join in commending staff: Mark Powden for his fine work, Susan Hattan, Scott Giles, Jenny Smulson, Corey Heyman. 
Senator Kennedy's staff: Marianna Pierce did a wonderful job on the Democratic side working on this and keeping us well informed and trying to work out amendments during the committee process and on the floor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I inquire of the distinguished Democratic leader if he is not aware of what the effect of this cloture motion may be on the product liability legislation? I raise that question of the Democratic leader because I am a cosponsor of this bill. I am one of a handful of Democrats who have supported the work of my good friend, Senator Gorton from the State of Washington, and Senator Jay Rockefeller, our colleague from West Virginia, who are the lead sponsors of this legislation. 
I raise the point with the Democratic leader; I go back to the days of Jack Danforth and working on a proposal some 10 years ago on product liability legislation, tort reform. As someone who authored, along with Senator Domenici, the securities litigation reform bill and uniform standards, I am very interested in seeing us get a bill done here. We have indications the White House is going to be supportive of this legislation. For the first time, we might be able to do something about this issue. 
I am inclined to agree with the managers and principal authors of this bill that we probably ought to keep this bill pretty clean. So I am sympathetic to that notion. 
But I cannot imagine at this point filing cloture on this bill. I disagree with the majority of my colleagues on this side who disagree with this bill, but I will fight with every power in me as a Member of this body to see to it that any Member has a right to raise amendments about this bill. 
I may vote against all the amendments, but if we reach a point here, Mr. President--and I say this to ask a question of the Democratic leader--if we reach the level where we end up becoming sort of a mirror image of the House, the other body, where we deprive the minority, as the rules of the House allow, to cut off debate where the will of the majority prevails, then we turn this institution into nothing more than a mirror image of the institution down the hall. 
But in this body it is something different. Here, the rights of the minority are to be protected. And so the right to offer amendments, to be heard, is sacrosanct when dealing with the U.S. Senate. 
So it is with a deep sense of regret that I inform my colleagues, who have worked hard on this bill, that I will oppose a cloture motion. I hope other Democrats who support this bill will do likewise, so that we can get back to the business of debating this bill, take the day or 2 that it needs to be debated here, let the amendments be offered, let us defeat them if we have a majority here, and get about the business of passing this legislation so that this Congress might deal with product liability legislation. 
I raise that, Mr. President, in the form of a question to my colleague, the Democratic leader, because I am saddened by this. Why are we filing cloture on this bill? We are coming this close to, for the first time, dealing with tort reform, really dealing with this issue, not in as comprehensive a way as some would like, but a real chance for the first time ever. And you are taking people like me who support this bill and asking me to vote in a way that would disallow my colleagues from offering amendments on this legislation and thereby killing this bill. It will destroy this bill on tort reform over this procedure. 
So I raise the question to the Democratic leader, if in fact it is not unwittingly maybe what the majority leader, who has offered the cloture motion, is achieving by forcing those of us who support this bill to oppose a cloture motion and then depriving us of legislation being heard and fully debated?

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee for their fine work on the Strom Thurmond Defense Authorization Bill which passed the Senate by a vote of 88-4 on June 25th of this year. The nearly unanimous support by this body for this $270 billion authorization bill is a real tribute to their diligence and foresight. 
This bill will deservedly bear the name of my good friend Chairman Thurmond in recognition of his life-long commitment to the defense of this nation. Some may think that the Chairman s devotion to national defense began with his assignment to the Armed Services Committee some forty years ago, but they would be mistaken. In fact, Senator Thurmond joined the Army reserves in 1924. Shortly after the United States declared war against Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany in 1941, at the age of 39, Senator Thurmond resigned his judgeship and joined the Army. As a member of the elite 82nd Airborne Unit, he worked behind enemy lines in advance of the D-Day invasion force which landed 54 years ago this month. He won a Legion of Merit and rose to the rank of Major General in the Army Reserve. So Senator Thurmond has not only played a major role in developing national defense policy, but he has literally stood at the vanguard in the defense of this nation. 
The bill bears the imprint of his strong commitment to the national defense. In addition to procuring world-class weapons systems and preserving troop readiness, the bill includes a 3.6% pay increase for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. The men and women who serve on the front lines deserve that increase for their determination and commitment in defending this nation. 
For the retirees who served in the Armed Forces for most of their lives, this bill includes three health care demonstration projects. The goal is to provide the best possible health care to the protectors of this nation by eliminating the weaknesses of the present system. 
The bill provides $2.7 billion for the second New Attack Submarine which will be built by Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding. These two shipyards, the finest in the nation, will continue to build the world s most capable submarines. 
I am concerned, however, by reports that the Navy's strength may drop below 300 ships and the attack submarine force below 50 submarines. Recent events in the Persian Gulf and on the Indian subcontinent should serve as reminders that we face an uncertain future. We must not allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security that would have us cut the number of submarines to less than half of Cold War levels. After all, a couple of submarines can cut off the world's supply of oil from the Persian Gulf. We have worked too hard during two world wars and the Cold War to let our guard down now, and I believe we must remain vigilant. 
The Senate Armed Services Committee deserves praise for adding eight UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters to the President's request for a total of 34 Blackhawk-type helicopters. Four of these versatile aircraft will be delivered to the Navy, twelve will be delivered to the Army, and eighteen will go to the National Guard. Most of the Blackhawks will replace Vietnam-era Huey helicopters that cannot meet everyday commitments. I hope that we will see a larger request from the President next year in recognition of the needs of all three services. 
Finally, this bill fully funds other vitally important defense programs, including the Comanche helicopter, the C-17 cargo aircraft, the F-22 fighter and the JSTARS aircraft. These systems will be elements in this nation's arsenal for decades to come. The Committee's careful consideration of these programs led them to decisions that I whole-heartedly support. 
As a whole, the bill is good for this nation's defense and it is vitally important in the less-predictable world of today. I am proud to stand with my colleagues on the Committee and the vast majority of the Senate in supporting this bill.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't want to interrupt this flow, but I want to join very briefly. 
Mr. President, I stand here merely as a foot soldier in this discussion. However, I would like to take a moment to offer some comments on the Supreme Court's decision today to strike down the line-item veto as unconstitutional. 
I am proud to say that I was one of 29 Members who in March of 1995 cast a vote against the line-item veto, along with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, and Senator Moynihan and 25 others on that day who expressed their opinion that they opposed this legislation--not as I recall, although others may have said, because they disagreed with the approach to deal with the budget issue. In my view, it had little or nothing to do with the budget process, but had everything to do with the issue that provoked the briefs to be filed, amicus curiae briefs, and the subsequent legal actions--that issue is the constitutionality of the line-item veto. 
I just wanted to point out that I was looking over the vote. And of the 29 people who voted against the line-item veto in March of 1995, six Members of that group of 29 have since left the Chamber. This list includes our distinguished colleagues Senators Hatfield, Johnston, Nunn, Pell, Pryor, and Simon. Two others who voted nay--Senators Bumpers and Glenn--will be leaving at the end of this Congress. 
The other day, someone counted some 100 different proposals which are being drafted or have been introduced that would amend the Constitution in one way or another. 
I am not questioning the intentions or even the desired goals that those constitutional proposals have in mind. But the framers and the founders of the document, which I happen to carry with me as well--a lesson I learned one day watching the distinguished colleague from West Virginia. I got my copy of the Constitution. I carry it in my pocket every single day, and have ever since, along with a copy of the Declaration of Independence, which is included here. 
It is our job here to do everything we can to advance the goals and desires of our society, particularly as we enter a new millennium and a new century. But the fundamental principles, values and ideals incorporated in the Constitution, the basic organic law of our country, are rooted in sound philosophical judgments. And the temptation, particularly in the midst of great difficulties--and certainly the budget crisis was no small difficulty with $300 billion of deficits a year, $4 trillion in debt--the temptation to want to come up with an answer to that was profound and significant. 
There will be other such crises, maybe not of that nature, but maybe of other natures that will come along, and the temptation will be to solve that problem and to do so by circumventing the values and principles incorporated into the Constitution. I only hope that we remind ourselves of what our forbearers had been struck with; and that is not to in any way denigrate or detract from the fundamental principles of the Constitution as we struggle through a very deliberative, painful, oftentimes annoying and frustrating process called democracy to address the issues of our day. 
I often point out to my constituents back home that as a country we have been through a great Civil War, two World Wars in this century, and a Great Depression when I am sure the temptations were great to amend or suspend parts of our Constitution, our Bill of Rights particularly. And we never saw fit to do so during all of those great crises. We never saw fit to do so. We thrive and are strong today as a nation without having made a single change in the Bill of Rights--not one change since those words were first crafted and drafted in 1789--not a single word. Not a single syllable has been changed in the Bill of Rights. 
I hope that as we look forward to a new century and a new millennium, with all the unanticipated problems we face as a nation in the world, that we will not be tempted to be drawn `to the flame'--to use the analogy of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia--to draw to that flame which could defeat it. And I will not put flame to this document and destroy the very principles and values which I think are the rationale and reason for why we have achieved the level of greatness that we have as a people. 
As one Member of this body, I suspect, speaking on behalf of the six who are no longer here, and those who are not here on the floor, we thank you immensely on behalf of our constituents, both past, present and in the future, for the three of you, along with Senator Hatfield who led this effort beyond the Chamber here and brought the matter to the highest court of our land. I also extend my gratitude to those six Supreme Court Justices for the decision they handed down today. 
With that, Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. And, again, I have said to him in meetings of our own committee, where we sat together and worked together so many times, Dan Coats is going to be missed in the Senate. He has been one terrific Senator, and Indiana can be very proud that they sent someone of his talent, ability, and tenacity. I would much rather have him as an ally than an opponent. I have been an ally of his and have been on the opposite side. Believe me, it is much more pleasant to have Dan Coats on your side. It is a privilege to say so on this floor, as I have on other occasions.

Mr. DODD. Let me begin my thanking my colleagues on both the minority and majority sides for their support of this amendment. I rise on behalf of military retirees, all of whom are due a pension and medical benefits at age 60, as all of my colleagues are well aware. This amendment directs the Secretary of the Army to eliminate by the end of this calendar year a serious backlog that has developed in the processing of pension applications by Army personnel. 
My awareness of this problem began, as I think my colleagues will appreciate, with a letter that I received from a constituent, Mr. Arthur Greenberg, of Hamden, CT. Mr. Greenberg, a Vietnam veteran, retired from the military in 1984. Mr. Greenberg submitted his pension application back in February, 6 months before his 60th birthday. Recently, he called to check on the status of his claim and was told that his pension claim would not be processed until 9 months after his 60th birthday. I assumed that this was just an isolated case and merely a problem to be corrected through the normal corrections in the bureaucracy. 
The Army informed me, however, that this is not an isolated case, and that its retirement benefits office presently holds a backlog of 2,000 cases out of a total of 5,000. So Mr. Greenberg's situation is not the exception but fast becoming the majority of cases, in terms of pensions to be received. In other words, 2,000 military retirees who have reached their 60th birthday and become eligible for pensions and medical benefits are waiting for those benefits to come. 
The number of military retirees who become pension eligible increases every year. In 1994, there were 6,700 pension packages that were submitted. In 1996, the number jumped to 8,700. By the end of this year, over 10,000 Army retirees will have asked for their pensions. To give you some sense of where this is headed, 10 years from now that number will be 29,000 applications for pensions and medical benefits. In the face of this steady increase in the number of pension-eligible retirees, the office that processes Army pensions has been reduced from as many as 40 personnel a couple of years ago to just 17 people today. 
I realize the Army must make personnel reductions, but in view of its increasing workload, the Army pension office should not be so drastically cut. Some retired soldiers who spent a career defending this country cannot easily afford to wait for several months to begin receiving their retirement benefits. Those benefits make a difference in the majority of these people's lives. 
From the first day of boot camp, the Army has demanded from those who go through that process that they be punctual and responsible. Now, however, they must camp out by their mailboxes while they wait on the Army to provide the benefits to which each of them is entitled and due. This amendment, very simply, directs the Secretary of the Army to submit a report to Congress regarding this backlog and eliminate the backlog no later than December 31, 1998. 
Furthermore, it requires the Defense Department to provide up to $1.7 million from existing funds to eliminate the backlog of Army pension claims--$1.1 million to update antiquated computer systems and another $600,000 to hire some additional 10 civilian personnel. That would get you up to 27--far short of the 40 we had before. 
By the way, I should say that the Army supports this amendment. They don't like the idea they cannot provide these benefits. But they believe these numbers would allow them to update their computer systems and hire the necessary personnel to process the claims. Then we can avoid, to put it mildly, the embarrassment of seeing these pensioners wait to get the dollars they are due. But, more important, the people who deserve these benefits will receive them on time. 
I am very grateful to our colleagues, both the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, as well as my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, and the other members of the committee for their support of this amendment. I am grateful to them for allowing it to be considered and adopted, as I am told it will be, by approval of both sides. 
I yield to my colleague from Michigan, whom I see on the floor, for any comments he wishes to make on this.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I had some time allocated for another amendment here that addresses Lyme disease, which we in Connecticut are painfully aware of since the name `Lyme disease" comes from Lyme, CT, the town where it first achieved prominence. But I am going to defer on that and allow the Senate to consider the amendment at a later time.

Mr. DODD. I thank my colleagues, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Michigan. And I realize they are waiting for a couple of amendments to come over and be dealt with on this bill. So as soon as I see someone walk in with an amendment, I will truncate these remarks so as not to interrupt. I know they have the important business of the Department of Defense authorization bill.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment, along with Senators Lieberman, Chafee, Reed of Rhode Island and Lautenberg, to expand DoD's research into preventing and treating Lyme Disease and other tick-borne illnesses. 
Almost everyone in my state, including myself, has seen the devastating impact the Lyme Disease, in particular, can have on its victims. 
Most of you know that Lyme Disease has particular meaning for residents of Connecticut. While it wasn't discovered in my state, it did achieve prominence there in the early 1980s, and, in fact, is named after the town of Lyme, Connecticut. 
Like many northeastern states, CT experiences more than its share of the anguish that this condition inflicts--my constituents face a Lyme Disease rate that is 10 times the national average. 
The damage imposed by Lyme Disease on individuals and on families is heartbreaking. Health problems experienced by those infected can include facial paralysis, joint swelling, loss of coordination, irregular heart-beat, liver malfunction, depression, and memory loss. 
Unfortunately, Lyme Disease mimics other health conditions and patients must often visit multiple doctors before they're properly diagnosed. The result is prolonged pain and suffering, unnecessary tests, and costly treatments. 
Long term treatment expenses can exceed $100,000 per person--a phenomenal cost to society. But an even greater price is paid by the victims and their families. We can put no price tag on the emotional costs associated with this disease. 
Tragically, the number of Lyme Disease cases reported to the CDC has sky-rocketed--from 500 cases in 1982 to 16,000 cases in 1996. And these cases only represent the tip of the iceberg. Several new reports have found that the actual incidence of the disease may be ten times greater than current figures suggest. And due to the warm, wet winter caused by El Nino, infection rates are expected to reach record levels in the near future. 
The growing number of cases has led the Department of Defense to recognize that Lyme Disease and other tick-borne illnesses pose a potentially serious health threat to our troops, civilian employees, and residents at military installations all over the world--and thus a threat to our military readiness. Indeed, hundreds of troops have already been infected. And infection rates among enlistees are expected to rise along with those in the civilian population. And each time a soldier contracts Lyme Disease, he or she contracts a potentially debilitating illness that could compromise the overall readiness of our armed forces. 
While recently approved vaccines offer hope for significantly reducing the number of Lyme Disease cases in the long-term, we can't let down our guard. 
These vaccines aren't yet 100% effective and aren't approved at all for children or adolescents. Furthermore, the vaccines don't protect against other rapidly emerging tick-borne diseases. And, of course, these vaccines do nothing to help individuals who are already infected. 
To protect our troops, DoD must increase its surveillance of these diseases, improve its ability to diagnose and treat tick-borne illnesses, and expand its research into new options to prevent the spread of Lyme Disease. This amendment would direct the Defense Department to provide $3 million to put toward these goals. 
This sum would come out of existing Defense Department funds for medical research--funds which total some $250 million. The amendment leaves to the discretion of the Secretary how to best allocate such funds to as to make this necessary commitment to research. 
I truly look forward to the day when Lyme Disease no longer plagues our citizens and troops. It's time that we take Lyme Disease seriously and establish a concrete commitment to fighting this devastating disease. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on behalf of myself, Senators Hagel, Biden and Roberts. The objective of this bill is to restore some rationality to what has become a very complex and problematic compilation of Congressionally imposed unilateral economic sanctions laws. 
The bill we are introducing today--the `1998 Sanctions Rationalization Act' would give the President the authority to delay, suspend or terminate a sanction that he believes not to be in the United States national interest. But it would also give Congress an opportunity to review each Presidential exercise such authority, and to enact a resolution of disapproval to maintain a particular sanction, under the expedited procedures, within thirty days of Presidential action. 
Mr. President, on June 4, I joined with Senator Lugar and others as a cosponsor of S. 1413--the Enhancement of Trade, Security, and Human Rights Through Sanctions Reform Act. This bill creates a framework for future consideration by the legislative and executive branches of unilateral economic sanctions. I applaud Senator Lugar for his vision in putting together this piece of legislation in cooperation with Congressman Lee Hamilton. 
I believe that the legislation I am introducing today complements the efforts of Senator Lugar and Congressman Hamilton by dealing with sanctions that are already imbedded in statute and which have come to threaten the ability of the President of the United States to conduct United States foreign policy in furtherance of U.S. national interests. 
Mr. President, U.S. sanctions--predominantly economic, but also political and sometimes even military penalties--are being employed more and more frequently for a variety of purposes. The United States, more than any other country, uses sanctions to further its many, sometimes conflicting, foreign policy objectives. We have used them among other things to discourage the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and transfer of ballistic missiles, to advance human rights, to end state supported terrorism, to discourage armed aggression, to protect the environment, to thwart drug trafficking, and in isolated instances to oust unacceptable governments. 
Some recently released statistics illustrate just how pervasive U.S. sanctions have become, and at what cost to the United States. Since World War II, the United States has imposed sanctions on roughly 100 occasions--more than sixty percent of those sanctions have occurred just since 1993. Between 1993-1996, sixty-one U.S. laws and executive orders have been enacted authorizing various types of unilateral economic sanctions against thirty-five countries in the name of foreign policy. The sanctioned countries encompass 42% of the world's population--roughly 2.3 billion potential consumers of U.S. goods and services. 
In our zeal to punish foreign governments for offensive behavior, we have managed to cut ourselves off from approximately 20% of the world's export markets. Our allies and trading partners think we are crazy. They have happily filled the American void, often times gaining mid to long term competitive advantages in these markets even after specific sanctions have been repealed, to the extent that happens. 
Rarely, if ever, Mr. President is a careful and thoughtful analysis done of the costs and benefits of the proposed sanction or the likelihood of its altering the sanctioned behavior. In most instances, the issue is rushed to the Senate or House floor, so that the Congress can express its outrage at some perceived misdeed that just appeared in print or live on CNN. To the best of my knowledge there has never been any systematic effort on the part of the Congress to review sanctions once imposed, to consider whether they have achieved their objectives or have turned out to be counterproductive. 
Unilateral economic sanctions have truly become the foreign policy `flavor of the month' imposed by the Congress, in the heat of the moment, often at the behest of special interest lobbies. Mr. President, we may make ourselves feel good by voting to cut off foreign access to United States markets, goods, people and ideas. We may even please the particular domestic constituency that has clamored for Congressional action. But in most instances we simply fool ourselves if we think that we have done much, if anything, to alter the behavior or policy of the government that has been targeted. In fact, we have probably made it easier for governments, particularly the authoritarian ones, to resist any internal pressures to change, because they can blame their domestic failures on U.S. sanctions policy. 
Since we don't appropriate funds to cover the actual private sector costs incurred when sanctions are imposed, some in the Congress have come to view them as a cost free way to influence the Administration's conduct of foreign policy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Sanctions are one of the most pernicious `unfunded mandates' that the Congress can impose on the private sector, with virtually no prior consultation or input from it. 
According to the Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based think tank, the cost of sanctions in 1995 alone was nearly $20 billion in lost exports and 200,000 lost American jobs. If we carry those costs forward by five years, these same sanctions would cost the American economy $100 billion in foregone exports and one million jobs. That is a high price to pay for a policy that is successful. More often than not U.S. sanctions fail to alter behavior or policies. 
The costs incurred due to sanctions are more than simply direct economic costs. There are indirect costs as well--tangible and intangible. The cost to us diplomatically and politically with our friends and allies can be extremely high. I suspect, for example, that United States officials have expended a great deal of our diplomatic capital in defusing the anger of European officials and other interested governments concerning the extra-territorial application of certain recently enacted sanctions law. Such capital is not inexhaustible, and should be husbanded for those occasions when international support is critical to the United States effectively dealing with a major national security or foreign policy challenge--Iraq, Bosnia, Pakistan, India and even Kosovo come readily to mind. 
The time has come to call a halt to the indiscriminate use of unilateral sanctions as the foreign policy instrument of `first resort.' Perhaps we should consider the `old fashioned' way of conducting foreign policy--it's called diplomacy. While diplomacy may take longer to produce results and isn't as dramatic as voting to impose draconian measures against other countries, it more often than not gets us where we want to go. 
In saying that, I am not arguing that the United States should remove the sanctions option from its foreign policy arsenal, just as I would never suggest that we rule out the use of force as an option. Clearly there are occasions when sanctions or military force are the appropriate responses to a particular situation--Iraq for one. However, in recent years we have elected to exercise the sanctions option far too frequently, and in so doing we are undermining its continued effectiveness as a U.S. foreign policy tool. 
The United States, particularly the Congress must become more precise in the choice of sanctions, more realistic with respect to what is achievable, better informed of the potential costs to the U.S. economy and the American people, and more sensitive to the potential impact on innocent populations and on relations with other governments. It is especially problematic when Congress enacts sanctions and fails to include any flexibility in the statute to enable the President to respond effectively to what we all know is an ever changing political landscape. I believe that some of the measures enacted by the Congress are actually harmful to our long term foreign policy interests. 
A perfect example of this has occurred recently with respect to India and Pakistan. Because of the so called Pressler amendment, President Clinton had very little to offer in the way of `carrots' to Pakistan to dissuade it from following India in testing its nuclear weapons capabilities. The President has even less flexibility today to respond to the new threat that exists following both India's and Pakistan's defiance of the international community's pleadings to forgo testing. I say this because under existing nuclear non-proliferations statutes enacted by the Congress, sanctions are automatic and the President has no authority to lift them absent Congressional action to modify existing law. 
The international reaction to recent events in India and Pakistan has been very telling. Even our closest allies who share our concerns about nuclear proliferation have failed to follow our lead by imposing economic sanctions on India and Pakistan. Why? Because they do not believe that such an approach is likely to force India and Pakistan to sign onto international non-proliferations regimes. In fact, quite the opposite. It is likely to further isolate them, heightening domestic political pressure in both countries and encouraging each one to perfect even further their nuclear weapons capability and God forbid, even to consider using it against one another in a moment of paranoia. 
As I have said earlier, I do not believe that we should ever totally rule out the use of sanctions as a foreign policy instrument. But before we impose them we should be clear about what our foreign policy goals are. We should be selective in our choice of sanctions. They should be imposed for a finite time period, with an option to extend them, if the situation warrants it. We should also include a certain measure of flexibility in any Congressionally imposed sanctions to allow the Secretary of State and the President to fulfill their Constitutional obligations to conduct our nation's foreign policy--without their arms tied behind their backs. 
We should also endeavor to get other governments to join us in imposing sanctions. Multilaterally imposed sanctions have a far better likelihood of succeeding than those that are unilaterally imposed and they minimize the competitive disadvantages to the U.S. economy. This will mean that we must have patience as diplomatic efforts are undertaken to garner international support. 
If we find that we must go it alone, we should keep to a minimum the adverse effects of our sanctions on third countries, particularly friends and allies. We should also be more selective in the choice of sanctions we impose --opting for those that will be felt by the offending government officials, rather than those that are more general in scope and harm the general population--people who in most cases have little or no ability to influence the behavior of their government leaders. 
With economic sanctions fast becoming the very core of United States foreign policy, I believe that a more thoughtful and comprehensive approach to them is desperately needed before we do serious harm to our own national interests. The legislation introduced by Senator Lugar would provide such a framework in the context of future sanctions. The bill I am introducing today would create a similar framework of rationality with respect to existing sanctions regimes. 
I believe that the Lugar and Dodd bills, taken together, will help to sharpen the focus of the debate on this important subject. I believe such a focus is long overdue. I look forward to working with Senator Lugar and other interested Senators in forging a comprehensive legislative package that incorporates the approaches contained in the two bills so that our colleagues will have an opportunity to vote on these very important matters in the very near future.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the nomination of Dr. Jane Henney for the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. 
In November, 1997, President Clinton signed legislation charging the Food and Drug Administration with the responsibility for bringing lifesaving drugs and medical devices to the American people more quickly and efficiently, without compromising safety or effectiveness. This legislation requires the FDA to rethink many of its old models and to work collaboratively with the public and with drug and device manufacturers to improve the certainty of the product review process, to provide patients with better access to investigational therapies, and to encourage manufacturers to test the safety and efficacy of their products for children. Such responsibilities require strong, innovative leadership--leadership that Dr. Henney can clearly provide. 
Dr. Henney is a distinguished physician, a cancer specialist, and a nationally recognized academic leader and public health administrator who has served in the Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton Administrations. She served as Deputy Commissioner for Operations at the FDA from 1992 to 1994 and is thoroughly familiar with FDA's responsibilities, having managed the agency's daily activities and six operating centers. 
Dr. Henney has also proven her ability to manage in a challenging environment. At the University of New Mexico, she led the Health Sciences Center to increase its efforts to stabilize local health care delivery systems and to engage in extensive reorganization initiatives. Earlier, as a Deputy Commissioner at the FDA, Dr. Henney reorganized and improved the efficiency of the FDA's centers, recruiting new directors for five of the six centers. She also played a principal role in the enactment of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, which revitalized the agency's drug and biologics review system. 
The position of Commissioner of Food and Drugs has been vacant for more than 14 months, leaving without leadership a federal agency that arguably has a more direct and significant impact on the lives of the American people that any other. The foods we serve our family, the medicines we take when we're sick, and even the drugs we give our pets, are all approved and monitored by the FDA. One quarter of every dollar spent by consumers goes to products regulated by the FDA. Jane Henney's innovative managing skills as well as her medical reputation make her the ideal candidate to shoulder the responsibility for leading the Food and Drug Administration into the next century. I encourage the Senate to act expeditiously and support Dr. Henney's well-deserved nomination.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the conference report for H.R. 2646, the Education Savings Account bill. 
I regret that I cannot support this legislation because it contains several provisions that I do, in fact, support. In particular, I support the provision which would expand the tax benefits of qualified state-sponsored prepaid tuition plans to include tax-free withdrawals for qualified educational expenses. In fact, the Conference Agreement goes beyond the Senate bill, and would allow private educational institutions to establish tax-favored prepaid tuition plans beginning in 2006. 
I was also pleased that the Conference Report extends by 30 months Section 127 of the tax code to allow the income exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance for undergraduates until December 31, 2002. This measure is critically important to improving the knowledge and skills of our work force. 
These particular provisions were adopted in a spirit of bipartisanship and with an understanding that they would provide clear benefits to college-bound students. Unfortunately, these provisions are just a small part of a much larger package which marks a step in the wrong direction for federal education policy. 
At the heart of this bill is a proposal to provide tax-free savings accounts, funds from which can be used to meet the educational needs of elementary and secondary school students. Under the guise of `increased choice,' this proposal turns its back on our nation's long-standing commitment to our public schools. 
These so-called education savings accounts would cost taxpayers $1.5 billion over ten years. In return for this significant expenditure, families will receive very little benefit. Families whose children attend public schools--which is to say 90 percent of all students--would receive just $7 annually. Families whose children attend private schools would receive just $37 per year. 
Let me put that into context. In the Washington area, on average, one year of private school costs between $10,000 and $14,000. At those costs, this legislation provides very little assistance to the parents who would choose these schools for their children. 
Clearly, we are in need of education reforms in this country that will create better educational opportunities for more children. But I don't believe that draining resources away from our public schools will advance the cause of reform one bit. 
As we consider this legislation, I think that there is one important question that each member of this body should ask themselves. Aren't there better ways to spend $1.5 billion for our children's education than providing seven dollars a year to public school students? I believe that there are. 
We could use that money to help hire new teachers and reduce class sizes across the country. If a teacher has 25, 30, or 35 students in his or her class, those students are not going to learn as well as they could in a class with a lower student-teacher ratio. If we can make these classes smaller, we can greatly increase the learning potential of our children. The Democratic leadership has proposed committing resources to help hire 100,000 new teachers for kindergarten through third grade. If we made this investment, it is estimated that every K through 3 classroom in this country would have no more than 18 students. Unfortunately, the conference report we consider today does absolutely nothing to help hire these teachers and significantly reduce class sizes in this country. 
We could use this money to help local communities meet the rising costs of special education. In fact, I introduced an amendment during the Senate debate on this bill to redirect its $1.5 billion cost to help state and local school districts meet the costs of special education. When Congress passed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1975, the federal government committed to state and local school districts that it would contribute 40 percent of the funds needed for special education. However, the federal contribution has never risen above 10 percent. It is estimated that states now provide 56 percent of the financial support for special education programs and services, 36 percent comes from local sources, and only eight percent comes from the federal government. The burden on local taxpayers is increasing dramatically with each passing day, and it will continue to increase as long as we continue failing to meet the federal commitment to fairly share these costs. I have spoken with many mayors, school superintendents, and other local officials seeking relief and assistance in meeting the expenses associated with providing the valuable services required by children who have special needs. Unfortunately, my amendment was defeated and these local officials are still in search of relief. 
We could, additionally, invest the resources used by this legislation in school construction so children who currently attend schools in dilapidated and sometimes unsafe buildings could have a quality learning environment. In the richest nation in the world, we have schools that are literally falling apart. We have schools with broken heaters, bursting pipes, and leaky roofs. And beyond basic repairs, schools are also lacking electrical and telephone capabilities necessary to install computers in our classrooms. 
One-third of all students in this country go to school in buildings that are considered structurally inadequate, and 60 percent of American students attend school in buildings that are in need of repair. In fact, the General Accounting Office has estimated that more than $110 billion is needed to repair our schools. Clearly, this is an issue that should be addressed. 
This legislation is little more than a policy sleight of hand. It creates the illusion of reform without its essence. It offers a hollow promise of greater choice, and it delivers negligible benefits to American parents. The bottom line is that this bill is bad education policy, and it is also bad tax policy. 
I realize that this conference report will likely be adopted by this body and by the House of Representatives. But it is my hope that it will be vetoed. I appreciate that my colleagues are working to find solutions to create better educational opportunities for our children. Unfortunately, I believe that the proposal before us is a misguided one that creates false hopes instead of real opportunities. This legislation would have a devastating impact on our public schools, upon which 90 percent of American children rely on for their education, and it would mark a missed opportunity to seriously address the education needs of this nation. I hope that this conference report does not mark the end of our efforts this year to improve education in this country, and that the Senate will be willing to work in a bipartisan spirit to develop more substantial and innovative education reform policies that support our public schools.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, with this week's defeat of S. 1415, the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act of 1998, the Senate has for the time being lost a unique opportunity to create a better future for our nation's children. Cloaked in a procedural vote, the Republican leadership of this body voted to override the will of a majority of our colleagues and scuttle an historic effort to protect our children from the ravages of tobacco. In the end, a determined minority of Republican Senators was more responsible to the wishes of the tobacco industry than the need's of America's children. 
Preventing the devastation that tobacco wreaks on our children was the impetus for the considerable work that went into the drafting of this bill over the past several months. It is also the reason why many of us have been willing to devote a significant portion of the Senate's time--almost four weeks--to this cause. 
We know that ninety-five percent of all adult smokers begin smoking as children. An estimated 3,000 youth start to smoke each day--a number that has been increasing for the last five years. One thousand of those children will die early as a result of taking up this deadly habit. Provisions in this legislation would have reduced by two-thirds the number of children who smoke. 
Those who voted to abandon this effort have chosen to allow our children to continue purchasing over 256 million packs of cigarettes per year, providing over $500 million in revenues to tobacco companies. They have chosen to do nothing to prevent sickness and death that are certain to befall millions of children who become addicted to tobacco. 
This bill would have been a tremendous step in the right direction. As originally drafted it would have comprehensively addressed the epidemic of youth smoking by funding anti-smoking campaigns and smoking cessation programs, reducing the ability of young people to buy cigarettes, and limiting the ability of tobacco manufacturers to market to children. There were also a number of other improvements offered to the bill during debate on the floor, which I was proud to support. 
In particular, I was pleased to see two amendments incorporated into the bill that would have provided strong disincentives for tobacco manufacturers to continue to market to America's children. The first provision would have ensured that tobacco companies would be penalized if they marketed to children by denying them the ability to claim a tax deduction for those advertising expenses. A second amendment would require the tobacco industry to pay stiffer lookback penalties if youth smoking reduction targets were not met. 
Public health and economic experts agree that the cornerstone of any effort to reduce youth smoking is a steep increase in the price of tobacco over a short time. That is why I strongly supported an amendment to increase the price of cigarettes by $1.50 per pack, the minimum amount of increase that experts agree is needed to reduce youth smoking. This price increase would have reduced the number of children smoking by 60% in one year, kept 2.7 million kids from starting smoking, and would have saved 800,000 lives. While I was disappointed that the proposal was defeated, I was encouraged that a majority of the Senate resoundingly rejected an attempt to strip from the bill the original $1.10 per pack increase--one of the bill's strongest weapons against youth smoking. 
I was also proud to support a provision that would have improved the quality of child care and made it more affordable and accessible to all Americans. By setting aside for child care 50 percent of the federal portion of tobacco funds going to states, this provision would have provided a solid foundation and a concrete committment to the future health and safety of our children. 
There were also a number of amendments to this legislation which I opposed out of concern that they would have significantly weakened its impact. First, I was unable to support an amendment that would have denied tobacco manufacturers any limitation on annual liabilities. Like the Administration, I believe that some limitations on liability were necessary in order to maximize our chances of passing a bill that would actually succeed in curbing youth smoking. Without such provisions, members of the industry were prepared to argue that their First Amendment rights were violated. They would have tied the legislation up in courts for decades, while leaving America's children unprotected. 
Several amendments concerning limits on lawyers fees were also considered as part of the debate on this bill. While the lowest proposed limit would have perhaps inadvertently limited access by individuals to attorneys willing to take their cases, I supported subsequent amendments which offered less onerous limitations on the amount attorneys can charge to bring suit against the misdeeds of the tobacco industry. 
I was troubled by efforts of some Members to divert the funds dedicated in this bill for public health purposes. For instance, while I have been a staunch supporter of anti-drug legislation, I was unable to support an amendment that would have gutted anti-tobacco public health programs in the bill in favor of poorly crafted anti-drug provisions. This amendment would have diverted public education funds to private-school vouchers for victims of school violence. A main flaw in this concept is that it offers assistance only after a student has been victimized, but does nothing to prevent crimes against children before they happen. This amendment would have also overridden the collective bargaining rights of employees of the Customs Service, undermining a successful anti-drug program developed through cooperative labor-management relations. It would have also barred Federal funds and limited non-federal funds for needle exchange programs--programs that have effectively helped control the spread of the deadly AIDS virus in our communities. Not surprisingly, this amendment was opposed by several law enforcement entities. 
In contrast, the Democratic alternative, which I did support, would not have jeopardized funding for public health. This alternative would have included tough money laundering provisions, not present in the Coverdell amendment, which would have provided critical assistance to law enforcement to combat drug problems. Rather than weakening the Customs Service, it would have increased the drug interdiction budget for the agency as well as for the Coast Guard and the Department of Defense, using general revenues. In addition, the Democratic alternative would have created financial incentives for states to report on and improve the safety of schools. 
I also felt compelled to vote against the marriage penalty amendment offered by the Republicans because, in my view, the amendment did not provide targeted relief to those who need it most. In fact, 60 percent of the tax cut in the provision would have gone to couples who currently enjoy a marriage bonus. Moreover, this amendment was a costly measure--costing 50 percent more in the first 10 years than the Democratic alternative that was offered, which I was pleased to support. In addition, the Republican amendment would have been partially funded in the out-years by tapping into the projected budget surplus, potentially leaving fewer funds available for long-term Social Security reform. 
The Democratic alternative to this amendment would have reduced the marriage penalty in the tax code by a much greater extent than the Republican proposal for most couples with incomes below $60,000. Indeed, this amendment was carefully targeted and would cut the marriage tax penalty more for a greater number of families. Furthermore, this proposal would have cost far less than the Republican proposal, while preserving the capacity of the tobacco bill to fulfill its fundamental purposes: cutting youth smoking, recompensing states and tobacco farmers, and improving the medical knowledge about the treatment of tobacco-related illnesses. 
Mr. President, this was not a perfect bill. However, even with its flaws, it would have marked a dramatic step forward in the effort to protect children from the dangers of smoking. I was disappointed by its demise. But I firmly believe that its defeat is only a temporary one. The health of our children is simply too important for this Congress to ignore. I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the days to come to address this critical issue.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Cross Street African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church on the occasion of its 175th anniversary. This church, located in Middletown, Connecticut, has been a beacon of spiritual guidance in the community for many generations. In fact, Cross Street is the second oldest A.M.E. Zion Church in Connecticut and the seventh oldest in the world. 
The church's tradition of moral leadership and service to its community dates back to its earliest years. The Reverend Jehiel Beamon, the son of a former slave from Colchester, Connecticut, was the first pastor at the church. Not only was he a leader within the church, but he was also an active abolitionist who helped found the Middletown Anti-Slavery Society. He was also president of the Connecticut State Convention of Colored Men, which worked to secure voting rights for African-Americans. Due to his involvement and activities in the community, this church was called `The Freedom Church' by many people. 
Since that time, the church has been rebuilt and it has also moved. But while it has undergone physical changes, there has never been any wavering in the importance that this church holds for its congregation and surrounding community. 
In the church's written history, it is said that `the sole purpose for the church's formation was to secure a place for people of color to worship freely.' But Cross Street A.M.E. Zion Church has become far more than simply a place of worship. 
The members of Cross Street A.M.E. Zion have carried their message of hope beyond the church's walls and into the neighboring community. They are helping people in and around Middletown to deal with the difficult social problems of the modern day. They have initiated various projects to deal with issues ranging from homelessness to HIV. The people of Cross Street A.M.E. Zion Church are acting on their faith and they are reaching out to those in need to make their community a better place to live. 
This past April, I had the opportunity to attend Cross Street A.M.E. Zion Church for its Palm Sunday services. I was struck by the deep sense of faith and hope among the congregation, and I was pleased to share in their worship on that day. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to the Cross Street A.M.E. Zion Church on its 175th anniversary. Theirs has been a very rich history, and I hope that the church will continue to play a positive role in the lives of its congregation and surrounding community for many years to come.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to today in honor of the tenth anniversary of the founding of Greenwich School Age Child Care in my home state of Connecticut. 
As you know, child care has been a top legislative priority for me during my tenure in the Senate. After numerous hearings, debates, forums, and even passage of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act that I authored in 1990, I know that our country's working families continue to struggle with the issue of child care. Thousands of low-income children are on waiting lists for affordable child care, and much of what is available is of poor quality. Every day, parents face tough decisions about how their children will be cared for when they can't be with them. 
Ten years ago, in response to the child care needs expressed by the community, Greenwich School Age Child Care was created by a small, dedicated group of parents who understood the importance of safe, high quality child care services. At that time, there were no available services for before- and after-school child care within the community's schools. Since that time, the effort has grown from one school-age child care program in North Mianus Elementary School, to programs in all 10 public elementary schools. All of these programs accept children in grades kindergarten through fifth grade, in most instances offer both before- and after-school programs, and are open for the entire school year. This enables working parents to leave their child at 7:30 a.m. and return up to 6:00 p.m., knowing that their child will receive healthy snacks and loving care in a stimulating environment right in the school. 
I share the belief of Greenwich School Age Child Care that quality child care should be available to all low income and disadvantaged families who need it. Greenwich School Age Child Care is to be commended for their innovative efforts to make available quality child care affordable. The scholarship fund they established through the Board of Education, private donations, and CCDBG dollars is critical for low-income families who otherwise could not afford a safe and educational environment for their children. 
I am proud to be a member of the Greenwich School Age Child Care advisory board. I cannot emphasize strongly enough that their investment in quality child care pays off many times over, in terms of both the employment productivity of parents and the safety and well-being of children. I congratulate Greenwich School Age Child Care on the huge success of their first ten years, and wish them continued, long lasting success in the years to come.

Mr. DODD. What is the pending business?

<TEXT>
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I think this is a very fine amendment. I want to commend our colleagues, Senator Kerry and Senator Bond, for offering this amendment. I strongly support it. 
This amendment is designed to invest in the well-being of our children in this country. It is a measure that ensures that the children of our Nation will get the right start for a far brighter tomorrow. 
As our colleagues have already discussed, the amendment will earmark 50 percent of the Federal share of the tobacco funds going to the States for child care. Specifically, Mr. President, these funds will be used to increase our investment in child care and development block grants--a piece of legislation we were very proud to offer with my good friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, some 8 years ago. 
The idea, Mr. President, is not to create here a new Federal child care program, but rather to do a better job with the well-established program that enjoys wide support from our States and Governors, Republicans and Democrats alike, across this Nation. 
The child care and development block grant was created in 1990, as a partnership between the States and the Federal Government, to improve the availability and affordability and quality of child care. The block grant is a very efficient and popular way of providing States with sorely needed child care funds, and the States enjoy it. The reason is because it is so flexible. Perhaps most important, this is why parents also support the program. 
Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, in some cases, raised concerns during the child care debates that somehow our intent with this child care legislation is to limit the ability of parents to choose how their children would be cared for, that somehow we would like to see the Federal Government deciding how to raise them. Of course, Mr. President, this rhetoric could not be further from the truth. 
The child care and development block grant is predicated upon parental choice. With assistance from the block grant, parents can choose to enroll their children in church-based care, they can choose to have their children cared for by a neighbor down the street, or they can choose to have a family member care for their child. If they wish, they can choose to enroll their child in a child development center. But the benefits of this program are offered to far too few families. It is terribly underfunded. Only 1 out of 10 children in America who are eligible for child care assistance receives it. That still leaves far too many families without the help they need in child care. Full day care can easily cost $4,000 to $10,000 per child per year, which is equal to what some families pay for college tuition plus room and board in a public university in America. 
I know concerns have been raised and are apt to be raised about giving any direction to the States in their use of these funds. I would like to remind our colleagues that half of the tobacco funds that would go to the States are unrestricted. These are the funds that reimburse States for their tobacco-related Medicaid expenses. Many States do with this money what they will, and they should be able to do so. However, since the other half of the funds to the States represents the Federal contribution, we feel we should have something to say about how those dollars are spent. 
As this bill is currently written, the Federal share of the money earmarked for States would be restricted to a list of six programs. While child care is on the list, there is no guarantee that any of the funds would be used for that care. There is no guarantee that child care would get a single dime of these dollars. I think that would be unfortunate, Mr. President. We have talked a lot about child care, about caring for children during this debate on tobacco. We have talked a lot over the past weeks about things that, frankly, have little or nothing to do with the well-being of children in this country. Affordable, accessible, high-quality child care is about the well-being of children. The tobacco industry has preyed on America's children --all of us agree on that--stunting their growth and stealing their futures. This amendment is about turning the tide and making an investment in 
children and their families from the very beginning. 
Mr. President, experts tell us that the first 3 years of the life of a child are critical to brain development and to laying the ground for self-confidence--a sound foundation for a healthy future. Investing early in childhood development is the best prevention against a whole host of problems, not the least of which is teenage smoking. Experts, again, including Fight Crime, Invest in Kids, an organization representing law enforcement officials from around the country, tell us time and time again that quality after-school activities are extremely important to preventing problem behaviors and criminal activity. Scientific studies support their claims that nearly 5 million children left home alone in the afternoon are much more likely to engage in at-risk behavior, from smoking to drugs and sex than their peers who are engaged in stimulating, productive activities. 
Mr. President, the Senate has an opportunity in the next few hours to ensure that we make a concrete commitment to investing in the health and safety of America's children. Setting aside a specified percentage of funds--funds that we have already agreed to spend for the child care needs in this country--says to the American public that we will provide for a solid foundation for the future good health of America's children. Many of my colleagues know that I have introduced a comprehensive child care bill along with 26 other colleagues, including the sponsor of this amendment. This amendment is an important first step that I think we can take in making good and fulfilling the promise of that bill. Is this all we need to do? Obviously not, but it is a good beginning. 
I hope that our colleagues, in considering this amendment offered by Senators Kerry and Bond, in a bipartisan way, would find a way to support expanding this block grant. It doesn't create any new programs. It is designed to give maximum flexibility to families across this country. It can make a huge difference for those parents, who don't have the choice about whether or not to be at home, to be able to afford that needed child care. 
That $10,000, as I said a moment ago, is equivalent to the cost of a higher education and room and board. It is expensive. Child care is very expensive. If we can assist in the cost of that and relieve the financial burden and the tremendous anxiety the parents feel about wondering where their child is as they must work, then, in addition to doing something about reducing smoking among young people in this bill, that will be amplified by providing assistance to these families and seeing to it that their child care needs are going to be met, or at least it will take a significant step in meeting those needs. I commend my colleagues for offering this amendment and urge colleagues to support it. 
I yield the floor.  
Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, later this month the State of Connecticut will say good-bye to one of its strongest and most respected voices on women's issues: Patricia Russo. Known by her friends as Pat, Ms. Russo has worked for the past 18 years to promote civil rights for women, assure equality in education for girls, and help women achieve economic parity in the workplace. This July, Pat will be moving with her family to Tokyo, and she will be dearly missed. 
Pat Russo has served on the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW) for the past 15 years. She currently serves as the Chairperson of this agency, which provides research and analysis to legislators and state leaders on issues such as sex discrimination, child care, sexual harassment, child support enforcement and the economic status of women. 
On behalf of the PCSW, Ms. Russo is the founder of the Connecticut Women's Agenda, a state-wide coalition of key women's organizations in Connecticut. She also chairs the PCSW's Congressional District Advisory Council (CDAC) in the fourth congressional district. 
Ms. Russo's work on behalf of ending violence against women earned her a seat on the 1997 Task Force to Study Domestic Violence, along with the Attorney General and other state leaders. 
In addition to her work at the PCSW, Ms. Russo also serves on the Advisory Board of Woman magazine and the Advisory Council of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Crisis Center. She was recently appointed to the Board of Directors of the National Association of Commissions for Women (NACW). She is also President of the Women's Business Development Center of Connecticut, a new agency that moves women from welfare to work. 
Pat Russo's leadership has earned her numerous awards, including the prestigious Hannah G. Solomon award, given by the National Council of Jewish Women, and the distinction of `Woman of the Year' by the Business and Professional Women of Connecticut. 
In 1997, Ms. Russo was named to the Racial Justice Committee of the YWCA of Greenwich, and is an honorary member of the American Association of University Women, in celebration of her 20 years of activism on behalf of Connecticut women. 
I have known Pat personally for many years and worked with her on many important issues. I have always found her to be extremely capable and completely dedicated to improving the quality of justice for women in this country. She is truly a remarkable individual, and I am sad to see her go. I wish her only the best as she leaves for Japan and in all of her future endeavors.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my views on the ISTEA conference report. I commend the work of the Conference Committee on the job it has done. This is landmark legislation. It represents the most substantial transportation legislation ever considered by the Congress. The bill provides much needed funds for both the construction and repair of our nation's roads, bridges and rails. This legislation will provide the additional resources for our states to meet their compelling transportation needs. 
I am particularly pleased that the bill preserves the concept of intermodalism. After completing the nation's interstate highway system several years ago, we decided in the ISTEA bill adopted in 1991 that transportation was not just about highway construction. We committed ourselves to investing funds in other modes of transportation, such as light rail, bus and ferries. If our nation is to move people and goods safely and efficiently in the 21st century, we must diversify our transportation system. This legislation continues on that course. 
We have also preserved our commitment to mass transit, which is extremely important in densely-populated states like Connecticut. I was particularly pleased to join Senators D'Amato and Sarbanes in a successful effort to increase funding for mass transit by $2.4 billion dollars during deliberations between the House and the Senate conferees. I want to commend my two colleagues for their vigilance in this effort. 
This legislation also furthers environmentally-sound principles such as congestion mitigation, air quality improvement and alternative fuel technologies. I believe that energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly means of transportation are not only possible, but essential if our nation is going to remain strong, competitive and environmentally healthy into the next century. In this regard, I am particularly pleased that the conference report retains the Senate-passed level of funding for the development and deployment of maglev high speed rail. This is an extraordinary technology that can move people and goods on a fixed guideway at speeds of up to 300 mph. I believe that this mode of transportation can be to the 21st century what airplanes were to the 20th century, and trains were to the 19th--namely, a dramatic step forward in safe, efficient and reliable transportation. I applaud Senator Moynihan for his stalwart efforts to support maglev technology. 
In summary, Mr. President, this is good and important legislation. It will improve transportation safety, reduce congestion, diminish pollution, increase efficiency and create jobs for the people of America. For these reasons, the conference report has my support. That is not to say, however, that this is a perfect piece of legislation. I have a number of concerns, as I know that my colleagues do, that I hope will be addressed as we go forward. 
I am disappointed that the conference report did not include the Senate provision that would penalize states if they failed to change the legal definition of intoxication to .08 nationally. Although I am pleased that the conference report contains incentives for states to move in this direction. 
I am also concerned that the bill offsets some of its spending with a reduction in expenditures for veterans in need of treatment for smoking-related illnesses. For years the United States military effectively encouraged active duty forces to smoke by providing them with free cigarettes. Therefore, it is only fair that the federal government bear its fair share of responsibility for treating veterans with illnesses contracted as a result of addiction to those cigarettes. I intend to work with my colleagues, including Minority Leader Daschle and Senators Lieberman and Rockefeller, to insure that as Congress continues consideration of tobacco legislation, we provide for the needs of our veterans. 
I am also concerned about the reduction in the Social Services Block Grant. This block grant is important to children and families of modest means throughout the country. We must not compromise on our commitment to provide better health care, child care and nutritional assistance to these needy Americans. As a member of the Labor Committee, I intend to work with members of the appropriations committees to made sure that we find the resources to provide for these families.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there are many things about my home state of Connecticut that are a source of great pride to its people, but few are greater than the overall quality of our state's public schools. Connecticut students are performing at the highest levels in the nation on federally sponsored standardized tests. Three out of four Connecticut public school students go on to pursue higher education. And our public school students have outperformed students from private and parochial schools in our state. 
Many people have contributed to the quality of our public schools, in particular our parents and students. But the backbone of Connecticut's public schools is its teachers. In my view, they are the finest in the country, and there are numbers that back me up. More than 80 percent of Connecticut's public school teachers have advanced degrees, the highest percentage in the country. They are among the nation's most experienced teachers, with the average teacher having taught for more than 15 years. And the greatest testament to the quality of their teaching is the accomplishments of Connecticut's students. 
One organization, more than any other, has worked to ensure that Connecticut's children are taught by the finest teachers in the country, and that organization is the Connecticut Education Association (CEA). 
The CEA is a membership organization that represents nearly 30,000 elementary and secondary public school teachers in our state. Through the years, the CEA has consistently promoted the value of public education, encouraged public awareness of the resources needed to provide quality education, and emphasized the importance of the teacher in the education process. 
This is a significant year for the CEA: it celebrates its 150th anniversary. Over the past century and a half, the Association has been a consistent champion of children, teachers, and public education, and today, its voice on education issues is as strong as ever. There is no job more important than teaching our children, and I would like to thank and congratulate the Connecticut Education Association for a job well done. I wish them all the best as they celebrate this anniversary and continued success in the future.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the greatest leaders and supporters of public education that the State of Connecticut has ever known: Thomas P. Mondani. This past March, the State of Connecticut was saddened by his passing at the age of 63. 
Tom Mondani served as executive director of the Connecticut Education Association (CEA), the State's largest teacher organization, for longer than any individual in the organization's 150-year history. 
Mr. Mondani began his career in public education as a social studies and English teacher in Moodus, CT in 1959. He joined the CEA staff in 1963 as a research consultant and was promoted to director of research 2 years later. As director of research, he compiled and published numerous studies of statistical data related to educational expenditures in Connecticut. 
When Tom Mondani was appointed executive director in 1971, his work in school finance made him a recognized authority on research and education legislation in the State. 
Mr. Mondani also served in Connecticut's State legislature. In 1965, he was elected to the first of his two terms as a State representative, and in 1970, he moved from the House to the State Senate. As a State legislator, Tom Mondani worked diligently on education issues, and he authored legislation that provided maintenance of all accumulated tenure and sick leave rights for teachers who had been incorporated into recently formed regional school districts. 
Tom Mondani left public office in 1971 when he accepted his appointment as CEA executive director, and he often utilized the political skills that he developed in the General Assembly during his 22-year tenure. He worked with teachers as well as political leaders to secure the passage of many laws to help Connecticut's teachers, including improvements in teacher freedom of residency and the establishment of binding arbitration for teacher-board of education negotiations. During his tenure from 1972 to 1994, he helped develop major advancements for students and teachers in the areas of teacher standards, public school finance, and collective bargaining. 
Most recently, Tom Mondani served as vice chair of the State Board of Governors for Higher Education. 
In 1994, the CEA Board of Directors voted unanimously to recognize Tom Mondani's contributions by bestowing him with the organization's most prestigious award: the CEA Friend of Education Award. And not only did CEA present him with the award, but they also renamed the award in his honor. 
Upon his passing, countless people, including teachers, parents, and former Governors spoke out in praise of this remarkable man. They spoke of his commitment to the children of Connecticut. They remembered his leadership, wisdom, integrity, intellect and fairness. They said that he elevated the thinking in the State about children, teachers, and public education. 
I would like to join the chorus of voices singing the praises of this honorable man. I knew Tom Mondani, and I saw first-hand his commitment and dedication to helping others and improving the quality of our public schools. The people of Connecticut will miss him dearly.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who has worked tirelessly throughout his career to create economic opportunities in the northeastern region of this country: John E. Corrigan. Known by his friends as Jack, Mr. Corrigan has served for 23 years as Regional Director of the U.S. Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration. On Tuesday, May 26, 1998, in my home state of Connecticut, friends, family and admirers of this remarkable man will gather to celebrate his retirement after nearly three decades of service to his country as a public official. This celebration, sponsored by the Connecticut chapter of the Northeastern Economic Development Association, will be a fitting tribute to an outstanding public servant. 
Jack Corrigan makes things happen. Throughout his career with the EDA, he worked to make dreams a reality. His success is evident across the Northeast where he contributed to the creation of thousands of jobs and economic opportunities during his career. Indeed, Mr. Corrigan brought new meaning to the term economic development. He looked not only at specific applications, but enjoyed the foresight and vision to appreciate the domino effect which federal assistance could have on entire towns, cities, and regions. 
As Regional Director of the EDA, Jack Corrigan administered a multi-million dollar grant program. These resources were allocated throughout the region under his watchful eye, always ensuring that the money would provide an economic stimulus for many individuals and businesses. Jack's gentle style, measured approach, and good judgement helped many people to turn their dreams into reality. 
In addition to his service as Regional Director, Jack spent three years as Director of the Office of Civil Rights for the EDA. In this position, he distinguished himself as an effective advocate for civil rights and received the silver medal of the Department of Commerce for his outstanding performance in this field. 
From 1982 to 1985, Mr. Corrigan took a temporary reprieve from his Regional Director post to serve as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Operations of the EDA. In this position, he was responsible for the agency's grant program and for coordinating the related activities of the agency's six regional offices. 
Jack Corrigan will be deeply missed at the Economic Development Administration and throughout the northeast. His legacy, however, will continue as his exemplary public service is remembered and revered for years to come. I applaud the lifetime achievements of a special man and wish him continued success in all of his future endeavors.

Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me begin by thanking my chairman of the committee, Senator D'Amato, and Senator Gramm with whom I authored this particular proposal. 
Senator Domenici has been very involved in this issue, going back a number of years when the issue first arose, trying to deal with this sinister practice going on of strike lawsuits and predator law firms. I will share briefly some news out this morning as to how the law firms that we are trying to deal with operate, where the issue of fraudulent behavior is hardly their motivation; it has to do with simple stock fluctuation. Some Internet activity today will highlight that in categorical terms, as early as about 4 or 5 hours ago. This is a pervasive problem that needs to be addressed. 
We passed this bill out of our committee 14-4 on a strong bipartisan vote. The bill is endorsed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, supported by this administration, the Clinton administration. We will be happy to entertain the amendments as they are offered that come up that were raised in committee. We had hearings on this matter--not a lengthy markup, but an extensive markup--with an opportunity to vote a lot of the issues. 
I will pick up on some of the concluding comments and remarks of my two colleagues from Maryland and Nevada with regard to the recklessness standard. We received a letter of endorsement and support from the Securities and Exchange Commission, signed by Chairman Arthur Levitt, Isaac Hunt, and Laura Unger, March 24. This letter, I believe, has been introduced in the Record by Chairman D'Amato, but I am, at this juncture, going to highlight two paragraphs of this letter because they go right to the heart of what was raised a few moments ago when it comes to the recklessness standard. I will address this more directly in my remarks. Let me quote two paragraphs in this letter. 
As you know, when the Commission testified before the Securities Subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee in October 1997, we identified several concerns about S. 1260. In particular, we stated that a uniform standard for securities fraud class actions that did not permit investors to cover losses attributable to reckless misconduct would jeopardize the integrity of the securities markets. In light of this profound concern, we are gratified by the language in your letter of today agreeing to restate in S. 1260's legislative history, and in the expected debate on the Senate floor, that the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 did not, and was not intended to, alter the well-recognized and critically important scienter standard. 
Jumping down another paragraph, 
The ongoing dialog between our staffs has been constructive. The result of this dialog, we believe, is an improved bill with legislative history that makes clear, by reference to the legislative debate in 1995, that Congress did not alter in any way the recklessness standard when it enacted the Reform Act. 
Then it goes on to complete the paragraph. 
I don't know if anything can be more clear in this letter. Certainly the intent, stated in committee, stated on the floor previously, stated in this letter, and we stated again here on the floor today as to what the intentions were of those of us who crafted this legislation when it comes to `recklessness.' 
Now I agree. I mentioned earlier, some courts, a few district courts, have read otherwise. That happens. But we will try to make it clear that was aberrational behavior, erroneous behavior, in my view, rather than what we intended. 
I see my colleague from New York is rising.

Mr. DODD. I think the chairman of committee raises an excellent point, that in fact our legislative history included with S. 1260, the debate we have had, makes it quite clear what the intent of the committee was in 1995, what the intent of the committee in this legislation is today. 
In the absence of that, I think you might have courts ruling otherwise, even though we may have not drawn that conclusion in the earlier legislation.

Mr. DODD. I will do that in my remarks. 
There is a very difficult problem codifying the standard on recklessness. Congress has wrestled with this over the years. We were not the first committee to try. We thought leaving the standard as it has been in the courts, making sure we are not trying to make any change to that standard here, any way other than what has been an accepted standard, was a better way to proceed, based on the advice we received. 
We certainly did not change that standard, as has been the suggestion, either with this act or the act of 1995 despite the fact that some courts may have read it otherwise. I can't preclude a court from misinterpreting the decisions of a Congress. 
But the recklessness standard has been a good standard over the years and ought not to be tampered with, in my opinion.

<DOCNO>105-dodd-ct-5-19980513</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DODD. The problem has been, as you start trying to codify, we--I will take a look at what the Senator has. I haven't seen it. 
The suggestion has been made--what I was trying to respond to, prior to rising here, was that the suggestion was made that somehow this piece of legislation and '95 Act had undone the 
standard of recklessness that had been used. 
We made it quite clear--at least I thought we did--in 1995 that we were not altering the standard. Certainly the SEC believes that was what we intend. This legislative history and this debate on today's bill makes it clear it was not the intent. What I objected to was the suggestion that somehow we had changed the scienter standard. We had not done that. And the letter from the three members of the Securities and Exchange Commission, I think, reinforces the point--not whether or not you add something in the statement of facts or whether or not you have it in the legislative history where I believe it is most appropriate--about addressing the underlying concern and issue. And that is whether or not this legislation in any way, or the 1995 Reform Act in any way, tried to fool around with the standard of recklessness. We didn't then, and we aren't now. 
So what I am saying here today, what the chairman of the committee has said, and others, this is raising a red herring. It doesn't exist. It is difficult enough to debate where there is a legitimate disagreement, and there will be amendments offered where clearly there are provisions in the bill which my colleagues, including my distinguished friend from Nevada, disagree with. It is a fundamental difference here. Recklessness, as a matter of this legislation, is not a problem. It is trying to raise an issue that really does not exist. That is the reason I felt I should address that issue prior to making my general comments and statements about what I think is a valuable piece of legislation. 
Now, Madam President, let me, if I may, proceed here. It has been said, in the sense that we get the pendulum swings and the proposals are offered, in a sense, this is a very narrow bill. It is not designed to be all-encompassing and all-sweeping, yet it is being received by certain quarters as if it were a wide, sweeping piece of legislation. It is dealing with an underlying problem that still exists. The facts bear out the necessity of us trying to move with nationally traded securities on the national exchanges to see to it that we can set some standards here so we don't continue to end up with a proliferation of lawsuits chasing forums all over this country 
to satisfy a trial bar at the expense of jobs, investors in these companies out there. That is what has been happening. That is what we try to address with this bill. 
At the beginning of the debate today on S. 1260, the securities litigation reform standards, marks, in a sense, an anniversary, Madam President. It was almost 3 years ago that we took the floor of this body, many of my colleagues, in support of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. That bill, overwhelmingly enacted into law by Congress, was designed to curb abuses in the field of private securities class action lawsuits. 
Let me pause, if I can, to note just how important the private litigation system has been in maintaining integrity of our capital markets. It is highly questionable whether our markets would be as deep, as liquid, as strong, or as transparent were it not for our system of maintaining private rights of action against those who commit fraud. America's markets are the envy of the world because of the tremendous confidence that American and foreign investors have in the regulatory system that supports those markets. 
But it is precisely because of the vital importance of the private litigation system that the depths to which it had sunk by 1995 had become so damaging. The system was no longer an avenue for aggrieved investors to seek justice and restitution, but it had become, instead, a pathway for a few enterprising attorneys to manipulate its procedures for their own considerable profit, to the detriment of legitimate companies and investors all across our Nation. 
If we needed a reminder about how abusive that system had become, we received yet another example of it last week, with the conclusion of one of the last lawsuits filed under that old system. This litigation against a Massachusetts biotech company called Biogen, lasted more than 3 years, cost that company, in direct litigation expenses alone, more than $3 million. 
But even more than the direct costs, the lawsuit enacted an untold loss on the company because of the time and resources devoted by its top management and their scientists to defending themselves. 
The conclusion to this litigation on May 6 came in swift contrast to the lengthy and expensive lawsuit itself, as reported by Reuters:

Mr. DODD. I didn't realize how much time had already gone on. My colleague from Texas is chairman of the Securities Subcommittee and the principal author of the bill, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. 
While he is in the Chamber, let me commend and congratulate my colleague from Texas on this issue. This is a strong bipartisan bill, 14 to 4, coming out of this committee. It took a long time to go through all of this. We have had extensive hearings on it. We have listened to an awful lot of people. This is a good piece of legislation. It is needed out there, if we are going to in this day and age, with so many people wanting to get into this market, get more information to them, having a single standard here. Jobs and investors are affected when you have a handful of attorneys out there deciding they are going to act in a way that really brings great danger to our markets. And so I urge adoption of the legislation. 
I yield the floor at this point.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, is intended to create a uniform national standard for securities fraud class actions involving nationally-traded securities. In advocating enactment of uniform national standards for such actions, I firmly believe that the national standards must be fair ones that adequately protect investors. I hope that Senator D'Amato, one of the architects of the Banking Committee's substitute, would engage in a colloquy with me on this point?

Mr. DODD. At a hearing on S. 1260 last October, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voiced concern over some recent federal district court decisions on the state of mind--or scienter--requirement for pleading fraud was adopted in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ('95 Reform Act or PSLRA). According to the SEC, some federal district courts have concluded that the '96 Reform Act adopted a pleading standard that was more rigorous than the Second Court's, which, at the time of enactment of the PSLRA, had the toughest pleading standards in the nation. Some of these courts have also suggested that the 95 Reform Act changed not only the pleading standard but also the standard for proving the scienter requirement. At the time we enacted the PSLRA, every federal court of appeals in the nation--ten in number--concluded that the scienter requirement could be met by proof of recklessness.

Mr. DODD. I agree with the comments of my colleague from New York. I too, did not intend for the PSLRA to alter the state of mind requirement in securities fraud lawsuits or to adopt a pleading standard more stringent than that of the Second Circuit. In fact, I specifically stated during the legislative debates preceding and following the President's veto that the '95 Reform Act adopted the Second Circuit's pleading standard. This continues to be my understanding and intent today. Ensuring that the scienter standard includes reckless misconduct is critical to investor protection. Creating a higher scienter standard would lessen the incentives for issuers of securities to conduct a full inquiry into potentially troublesome areas and could therefore damage the disclosure process that has made our markets a model for other nations. The U.S. securities markets are the envy of the world precisely because investors at home and abroad have enormous confidence in the way our markets operate. Altering the scienter standard in the way envisioned by some of these district court decisions could be very damaging to that confidence.

Mr. DODD. It appears that these district courts have misread the language of the '95 Reform Act's `Statement of Managers.' As I made clear in the legislative debate following the President's veto, however, the disputed language in the Statement of Managers was simply meant to explain that the Conference Committee omitted the Specter amendment because that amendment did not adequately reflect existing Second Circuit caselaw on the pleading standard. I can only hope that when the issue reaches the federal courts of appeals, these courts will undertake a more thorough review of the legislative history and correct these decisions. While I trust that the courts will ultimately honor Congress' clear intent, should the Supreme Court eventually find that recklessness no longer suffices to meet the scienter standard, it is my intent to introduce legislation that would explicitly restore recklessness as the pleading and liability standard for federal securities fraud lawsuits. I imagine that I would not be alone in this endeavor, and I ask my good friend from New York whether he would join me in introducing such legislation?

Mr. DODD. I want to thank the Senator from New York, the Chairman of the Banking Committee, for his leadership on this bill and for engaging in this colloquy with me. In proceeding to create uniform national standards while some issues concerning the '95 Reform Act are still being decided by the courts, we must act based on what we intended and understand the '95 Reform Act to mean. As a sponsor of both the Senate bill that became the '95 Reform Act and the bill, S. 1260, that we are debating today, I am glad that we have had this opportunity to clarify how the PSLRA's pleading standards will function as the uniform national standards to be created in S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The purpose of this amendment is, obviously, to thwart the underlying rationale for the legislation. 
My colleagues have already pointed out that there are 50 jurisdictions with different statutes of limitations in them. My colleague from Nevada has worked long and hard on the issue of trying to extend the statute of limitations at the Federal level, which is an effort that I applaud and support. After the Lampf decision, I thought it is worthwhile. I don't disagree with him on that. I disagree with my colleague from Maryland. That is not the issue. 
The issue, of course, is not whether or not there is a statute of limitations at the Federal level but whether or not you are going to allow 50 different individuals to apply State statute of limitations on nationally traded securities accounts on national markets. The purpose of this bill is a uniform standard for which nationally traded securities are traded on national markets. 
If you are going to allow 50 different jurisdictions to apply 50 different statutes of limitations, you have just destroyed the very purpose of the legislation. Vote against the bill if you want. But you can't very well vote for this amendment and then vote for the bill. It doesn't make any sense at all. 
Of course, this idea that this has been a great disadvantage, let me share some hard facts with my colleagues about what has happened, because in order to make this amendment a Federal limit, you have to have information backing it, supporting it, underlying it, which indicates there is a problem here. 
The evidence since 1991, when the Lampf decision was rendered, clearly refutes the contention that State courts are necessarily a safety net for meritorious claims. The evidence of that would lead one to the opposite conclusion. The statute of limitations was shortened, as my colleague from Nevada and the Senator from Maryland pointed out, by a Supreme Court decision in 1991. That was 4 years, between 1991 and 1995, before we passed the 1995 litigation reform bill. 
So it is kind of an interesting 4 years to look at. You have the Lampf decision in 1991. We passed in 1995 the litigation reform bill. What happened between 1991 and 1995? There is almost no evidence, none, that plaintiffs brought securities fraud cases in class actions against nationally traded securities in State courts during 1991 and 1995--no evidence of it at all. That would be the time you might do it because there the law said, of course, you could go into State courts and use the State statute of limitations. If you want to take advantage of it, that period of time would certainly be an indication of what was going on. 
There is evidence that many of the suits brought in State courts since the 1995 act are well within the 1 to 3 years. Again, let me emphasize that I don't have any difficulty with the notion of having a longer period. I agree with my colleague on that. 
But he knows and I know we have been through that. We haven't been successful in extending it. Now, maybe someday we can. Maybe we can convince others. But that is a different debate--an important debate but a different debate. The debate here raised by this amendment is, do we allow the 50 different jurisdictions, 33 States which do better, 17 which do worse--by the way, in 17 States you would be disadvantaged between what the Federal law provides and what the State courts do. So you get a mixed bag on this. 
But since 1995, most of the actions that have been brought in the statute of limitations were brought well within the 1 year of the discovery or 3 years of when the fraud was committed, which is what the Lampf decision allowed and provided for. In fact, it is worthwhile to note that in some of these cases the suggestion somehow that the statute of limitations is a problem is ludicrous on its face. Three suits were filed against Intel Corporation within 48 hours of an adverse earnings announcement--48 hours; three lawsuits were filed within 48 hours. One in 3 years. It is ridiculous; these lawsuits are being filed almost momentarily in many cases. 
We have a second case of the EMC corporation. A case was filed within 20 hours of an adverse announcement. The notion somehow that this a great effort to discover fraud in these cases--the notion somehow that those of us in support of this bill in any way want to discourage investors from bringing legitimate lawsuits as plaintiffs is totally wrong. 
And part of what we rest our case on, Mr. President--let me share with my colleagues what you could find on your Internet this morning, not a year ago or 5 years ago or 6 months ago. It is entitled `Stock Disasters.' `Stock Disasters' it is called. That might suggest we have had some real fraud going on--`Stock Disasters.' You hit on your little mouse here, and you hit on `Top Stock Losers of the Day.' Boom, this page pops up. You have to get this one, and then you get this one. 
What does it show you? It lists stock fluctuations, stocks that lost money, stocks that gained money. That is all.

Mr. DODD. My colleague from New York is absolutely correct. The point we have been trying to make here is that if you go here --and `Stock Disasters' is the title of this, Mr. President--and then you switch on `Stock Disasters'--and the stocks decline in a couple cases, some stocks going up--there is no allegation here of fraud or mismanagement, merely stock fluctuations. 
Stock disasters? That is not a disaster. It is 10:52 this morning. That is how these suits are filed. It is ludicrous to somehow suggest we are talking about deep fraud in these cases. 
All we are trying to do is slow this down so that legitimate plaintiffs can bring lawsuits, and also legitimate investors particularly--and a lot of these companies, by the way, I point out, Mr. President, a lot of these companies, if you look at the losers as of 10:52 this morning, are your small high-tech firms. That is the future of our economy, by the way. That is the knowledge-based economy of our country for the 21st century. Let some predator law firm go out there because they get a slight stock fluctuation and bring a lawsuit against them, having to spend millions of dollars to defend the company, you lose the company. Who benefits from that? I tell you who does. The law firm. That is who does. That is all this is about, the bottom line. That is all this is about. 
So we talk here about the statute of limitations. Again, I am all for extending it. I think there is a case to be made on that. But to say here with nationally traded securities on national markets, these exchanges, that you are going to have to go through 50 different jurisdictions is to defeat the very purpose of what we are trying to do here. And that is, with nationally traded securities and national exchanges, we ought to have a uniform standard. I would have it be a bit longer, but that is not the issue before us. What is before us is whether or not we are going to have one standard here so that we can try to have some predictability and a little fairness in this process. 
Certainly what we have seen, of course, is a rush to the courthouse, and that is why I think this amendment is unnecessary. And if its adoption were to occur, it would destroy the very purpose which has brought us here at this point in our debate. 
For those reasons, Mr. President, I urge rejection of the amendment.

Mr. DODD. Our colleagues have made much of this notion that there has not been this great degree of activity. Try, if you will, to just keep these numbers in mind. These are the actions filed in State court for fraud in class actions against publicly traded companies. 
In 1992, there were four cases filed all across the country. In 1993, there was one case filed all across the country. In 1994, there was one case filed all across the country. I do not have numbers for 1995. But they are four, one, and one.

Mr. DODD. Then in 1996--we passed a law in 1995--59 cases were filed in State court; and in 1997, 1998, the number did drop down to about 38. But you compare that--they want to talk about how the number fell off to 38 from 59. What they do not want to mention to you is, in 1994 and 1993 and 1992 you had a total of six cases; in 1993 and 1994, one case--one case. And then it jumps, as we see in these other examples of where it moves to. 
So I say to my colleague and the chairman of the committee, this is quite clear. And if they wanted to get to statute of limitations problems, why didn't they file more of those cases in that period?

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is a very complicated area of law. I know our colleagues are going to come to the floor and want to know what this is all about. 
In effect, this amendment would have the impact of creating even further uncertainty in the definition of a class action. It does not provide more certainty; it is less certainty. I think it would upset the very carefully crafted and very balanced definition worked out with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The reason it took us a little time to get this bill to our colleagues was because we took so much time working with the SEC to try and define these areas. What our colleagues are offering is an amendment that would disrupt the definition worked out with the SEC in this area. 
Clearly, with all due respect, the tremendous amount of expertise in crafting it--I am not going to suggest to my colleagues that we have a perfect definition in the bill. But certainly this one is not perfect either. But if you are going to trust one or the other, it seems to me the one worked out with the Securities and Exchange Commission, I urge my colleagues, makes a lot more sense. 
Neither of these definitions tracks word for word what is in rule 23. Rule 23--trust me when I tell you this rule 23 goes on for pages, pages. It is one of the more lengthy definitions of class actions that there is. So, we are not tracking that word for word. We are trying to pick up the essence of it. It is tremendously complicated. 
We think this definition we have worked out with the Securities and Exchange Commission provides the right kind of balance. 
The bill originally had a limit of 25 plaintiffs, now raised to 50 for a single lawsuit. This is by no means an exact science. I am the first to say that if we find shortly that number is not working as well as we would like, we would change it. Anybody who claims they have a word on high as to what is the perfect number here is deluding themselves. It is a number we chose because we thought it made sense based, again, on our discussions with the SEC. 
With all due respect to the authors of this amendment, it does undercut what we have tried to achieve here. I want to emphasize to our colleagues, you don't have to agree with every agency and what it suggests and does. But on this definition worked out with the Securities and Exchange Commission, if you want some predictability and some knowledge-based definition, the one we have in the bill is the way to go. To come up all of a sudden with a new one here that I don't think enjoys the kind of expertise that we have been able to achieve through working with the SEC would be unfortunate and could create a lot more problems. 
For those reasons, I urge the defeat of this amendment.

Mr. DODD. Very briefly, the essence of this comes down to this, because this is very complicated. 
How does this work? It is a State court judge that has to make this determination as to whether or not these individual suits get consolidated. It is not a Federal judge; it is a State court judge. Obviously, a State court judge has broad discretion in making that determination. Even if he does do that, if an individual feels he does not belong in that grouping--obviously, we are trying to avoid a case where there are 50 or more individual actions that effectively operate as a single action, which would thus gut the bill and the uniform way in which we are attempting to deal with litigation issues. 
As I said, the decision to consolidate these individual actions must be with a State court judge, and then if the individual feels as though they really don't belong in that case, the State court judge has broad discretion to take that individual out. 
There are a lot of protections here. This is not heavy handed at all. It is a way to try and avoid exactly creating new loopholes where plaintiffs seek to consolidate individual cases and thus evade the provisions of this legislation. 
But that decision is the State court judges' decision and to their broad discretion. And secondly, the individual has the opportunity to go to that State court judge and make the case that they don't really belong in that class action. That State court judge has the broad discretion of keeping that person out of that class. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. I will be very brief on this. And we have been through this. The last time it was a 5-day debate. We ought to take some solace in the fact that we have done this in half a day. And let me commend my colleagues, all of them, who have been involved in this and over some period of time. 
But I say, Mr. President, this is a very sound piece of legislation that can make a huge difference today. That investor that my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Nevada, talks about, that is the investor that deposits their hard-earned money in the securities of struggling businesses, high-tech companies that are the primary targets of these lawsuits. And it is these industries that represent the knowledge-based economy of our 21st century. 
Too often we have seen predator lawyers out there go after them. What we are trying to do with this bill is to tighten up the loophole, to make it possible for these companies to grow while simultaneously--simultaneously--seeing to it that investors can bring a rightful cause of action, as plaintiffs, where fraud has been committed. 
This is going to make for a far sounder system for people in this country. And I predict to my colleagues that we will see economic growth in these firms and businesses, where they can avoid the kind of tremendous expenditures that have had to be laid out to fight frivolous lawsuits and end up as settlements, costing fortunes with, of course, cases being thrown out of court. 
So I predict to my colleagues, this will be a vote they will be very proud of in the years ahead to avoid these frivolous lawsuits we have seen in the past. I urge passage of the legislation.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit, with my colleague Senator Grassley, a Senate resolution that will focus attention on an extremely important health care issue for American families--long-term care needs. 
Rapidly increasing long-term care costs pose huge financial risks to families. With the average cost of nursing home care at $40,000 per year, early planning is required to ensure that long-term care needs don't leave the spouses or children of the elderly and disabled destitute. 
What most Americans do not realize is that Medicare is very limited in the type of long-term costs it covers. Medicare only provides coverage for `acute' health care costs, such as short-term stays in certain kinds of nursing homes, or short-term nursing care in the home following a hospitalization. Medicare was never meant to cover chronic long-term health needs. 
Medicaid does offer assistance with long-term costs, but only after an individual has totally exhausted his or her assets. This means that families must become completely impoverished in order to get Medicaid coverage for nursing home care. 
What fills in the gaps? We know that sixty-five percent of many elderly who live at home and need help rely exclusively on unpaid sources, such as family and friends. But this help is not without a price--it takes a huge toll on families. Caregiving frequently competes with the demand of employment and requires caregivers to reduce work hours, take time off without pay, or quit their jobs. Families whose members must be in institutional settings often exhaust all of their resources paying privately for nursing home care. 
As a country, we need to have better alternatives so that our Golden Years can be lived out with dignity. Our job as policy makers is to inform the public of the importance of planning ahead. Employers need to be encouraged to make private long-term care insurance coverage available to their employees. In turn, families should be encouraged to prepare themselves financially well in advance for this potential expense. 
A similar proposal by my fellow Connecticut colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman Chris Shays, has received strong bi-partisan support. My hope is that this commonsense, forward-looking proposal will receive the same kind of support by my colleagues here in the Senate. This Senate resolution truly represents an investment in our future.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the fifth class of inductees into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame. These five women gained recognition in fields of nature, justice, the arts, and finance and represent the best of my state and of our nation. 
I want to take this opportunity to speak about each of this year's inductees. 
Dorrit Hoffleit, a resident of New Haven, Connecticut, has established herself as a premiere astronomer through her work as senior researcher at Yale University. For over seventy years she has studied astronomy and has received an undergraduate degree from Radcliffe in mathematics and a doctorate from Harvard. Her interest in stars began early in her childhood when she saw two stars collide. 
During World War II, Professor Hoffleit worked as a mathematician at the Ballistic Research Laboratories at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. It is here that she felt the effects of being a female in a male-dominated field. She was paid less for doing the same work as her male colleagues. In fact, despite her doctorate she still received a sub-professional ranking. However, she protested this treatment and as a result was given her due rank and ultimately transferred to Washington. 
In 1956, she went on to direct the Maria Mitchell Observatory in Nantucket, Mass. Her work there helped to provide women with more substantial opportunities in astronomy. An indication of her success is that twenty-five percent of the students who worked with Professor Hoffleit have gone on to become professional astronomers. 
As a member of the Yale research faculty, Professor Hoffleit has made immense academic contributions to her field. She is most renowned for her two star catalogs. Her most well known catalog, The Bright Star Catalogue, has been defined as `the bible of virtually every stellar astronomer.' 
Despite retiring from Yale over twenty years ago, Professor Hoffleit continues to go to work every day. In these past twenty years, she has not drawn a salary. She is dedicated to educating her colleagues and future astronomers, rather than promoting herself and her career. As a result of her profound selflessness and service, the effects of her efforts will be as limitless as the stars she has spent a lifetime studying. 
A second inductee is Judge Constance Baker Motley. Born in New Haven, Connecticut, Judge Motley first became interested in civil rights after being denied admission into a local public beach and skating rink. 
After graduating from high school, she was unable to afford college, so she worked for $50 a month refinishing furniture. She continued to be active and to voice her beliefs, despite her inability to further her education. A local philanthropist, Clarence Blakeslee, heard her speak at the Youth Council in 1939, and he was so impressed with her that he offered to pay for her education. She graduated from New York University in 1943, and three years later received her law degree from Columbia University. 
After graduating from Columbia, she worked full time for the Legal Defense and Educational Fund of the NAACP, under then chief counsel Thurgood Marshall. She worked there for twenty years as a staff member and associate counsel and she was known for her impressive skill as an oral advocate. During her time at the Legal Defense and Educational Fund she argued before the Supreme Court ten times, winning nine appeals. She is renowned for her work with Thurgood Marshall and others on the landmark Brown versus Board of Education case. 
Judge Motley entered politics in 1964, serving in the New York State Senate. In 1965 she became the first woman to serve as a City Borough President. During this time, she worked on ways to improve the inner-city through better housing and schools. In 1966, she became the first African-American woman to be appointed to a federal judgeship in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. As a federal judge she continued to break new ground. In 1982 she was made chief judge and in 1986 was appointed senior judge. Neither position had ever been held by a woman before her. 
Judge Motley's work for justice over five decades has been responsible for some of the most extraordinary changes in American culture during our history. She has received many awards and honorary degrees for her immense contributions to civil rights and the legal profession. 
A third inductee is Rosa Ponselle. Born Rosa Melba Ponzillo, she was a first generation American, the daughter of Italian immigrants who settled in Meriden, Connecticut. She began studying music and singing at age ten. Her musical break came at eighteen when she auditioned for the great opera legend, Enrico Caruso. Immediately after auditioning, she was cast in the role of Leonora in the Metropolitan Opera's staging of Verdi's `La Forza del Destino.' She remained loyal to the Metropolitan throughout her career, and she spent all but four seasons of her nineteen-year career performing there. In fact, she was the first American-trained singer to star at the Metropolitan. 
Ms. Ponselle shocked the opera world when she retired in 1937. She dedicated the remaining forty-four years of her life to helping train and teach aspiring young operatic youths. One of her most notable students was Placido Domingo. She also served as the artistic director of the Baltimore Civic Opera Company. She died in Baltimore in May 1991. 
Her voice was said to exude a blend of youthfulness and maturity and she remains an inspiration to opera students and audiences worldwide. 
Lillian Vernon, another inductee, is a resident of Greenwich, Connecticut. She is the founder and CEO of Lillian Vernon Corporation. She entered the industry of mail order catalogues in the 1950's when it was dominated by industry moguls such as Richard Sears and A. Montgomery Ward. The company, which began in 1951, was one of the first to offer personalized merchandise by mail. The corporation was the first company founded by a woman to be publicly traded on the American Stock Exchange. 
Ms. Vernon also does a great deal of charity work. She serves on the boards of various non-profit organizations, including the Kennedy Center, Lincoln Center, New York University's College of Arts and Science, and the Children's Museum. She has been honored for her work as a business leader and community activist. She received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, the Big Brothers-Big Sisters National Hero Award, and the Direct Marketing Hall of Fame Award. Ms. Vernon is a remarkable entrepreneur, businesswomen, and role model. 
The final inductee is Mabel Osgood Wright. She was a resident of Fairfield, Connecticut and was the founder and President of the Connecticut Audubon Society. Wright established the first bird sanctuary in the United States, naming it Birdcraft. She founded the sanctuary around the turn of the century, fearing that bird life was being gradually eradicated. 
Wright saw conservation education as a key element to sustaining wildlife. She wrote many books in an effort to introduce children to nature appreciation and conservation. She published a field guide to New England birds in 1895. During this time, the Audubon movement was still young and was lacking public support. Through her involvement she helped to revive the organization on the state level. Aside from serving as President of the Connecticut Audubon Society, she served as an officer of the national group and as an editor and writer for Bird Lore magazine. 
It is said that Wright was unique in the environmental movement. This is because she was a nature writer as well as a community leader and her message focused not on the protection of our national parks but the preservation of our backyards, our gardens, and our bird sanctuaries. She believed the best way to preserve nature was through teaching children how to do it. 
Although she died in 1935, her message lives on at the Birdcraft Bird Sanctuary which remains a museum containing exhibits of Connecticut wildlife and providing frequent tours for school children. 
All five of these inductees are richly deserving of this award. I am pleased, indeed, that their remarkable lives will now become better known to the people of Connecticut and the United States for generations to come.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this month, the world's eyes are on the State of Israel as it celebrates the 50th Anniversary of its independence. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and praise the people of Israel on this historic occasion. 
Many centuries ago, Isaiah prophesied that Israel would become `a light unto the nations.' Today, Israel's light is shining brightly--not only for its citizens, but for people throughout the world. This nation arose from the ashes of the Holocaust and has given the Jewish people of the world a permanent homeland. 
The modern State of Israel has faced many obstacles in its short life, but it has survived them all, and in fact excelled in spite of them. Its population has grown from 600,000 in 1948 to nearly 6 million today as it has absorbed waves of immigrants from all over the globe. It is a vibrant democracy, with free and open elections and a free press. Despite a shortage of natural resources and many other obstacles, it has developed a thriving economy. And from this small nation, we have seen countless acclaimed writers, artists, and musicians. 
Israel has also shared a special relationship with the United States. Over the years, our nations have stood together to preserve Israel's safety and security, and I want to take this opportunity to join my fellow Americans in pledging our continued support for this trusted ally. 
This is also a time of celebration for members of the American Jewish population. Festivities are being held all across the country, and in my state of Connecticut, the United Jewish Federation and the Jewish Community Center of Stamford will hold a community-wide festival to commemorate the 50th anniversary on Sunday, May 17th. There will actually be another special event in Stamford the previous Thursday. 
On May 14th, the United Jewish Federation of Stamford will celebrate its 25th Anniversary. Throughout the years, the UJF has played a vital role in building and maintaining a sense of unity among Stamford's Jewish community. They have helped to promote and enrich Jewish life in the area by coordinating educational, social and philanthropic activities. They have also worked to defend the political and religious rights of the Jewish people, not only in Connecticut, but around the Nation, in Israel, and throughout the world. 
The UJF of Stamford's stated mission is to create a community based on the Jewish ideal of `tzedakah': charity, righteousness and social justice. Well, I would say that their works and actions have clearly embodied these three principles. I want to personally thank them for all that they have done to strengthen and improve both their community and our state, and I offer my sincere congratulations to them on this joyous anniversary.

Mr. DODD. I gather we are waiting for one of our additional colleagues to complete one more item on this bill. I want to take the opportunity, if I can, to join my colleague from Oklahoma in commending the chairman of the committee--I see him now entering the Chamber here--and Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan, Senator Kerrey, Senator Grassley, and others from the Finance Committee who have been involved in producing this piece of legislation. I think this is going to carry overwhelmingly, maybe even unanimously. That is something we do not do that often around here. And that is a tribute to what I think more Americans want to see, and that is a sense of bipartisanship on issues like this. 
This could have become highly controversial. But the fact that there has been such comity between the majority and minority I think has allowed us to produce the kind of legislation that we will be voting on shortly. 
I am going to in a minute ask for the attention of the 
chairman of the Finance Committee because I want to raise an issue. And I will raise it and talk a little bit about it. Maybe he is going to go through his notes a little bit. 
As our colleagues are aware, Senator Bennett of Utah and I are chair and vice chair of this new special committee on the year 2000 problem, Mr. President. This is to deal with the computer glitch that now has received widespread publicity over the last number of weeks and is an issue that some raised several years ago in this country warning us of the problem we would face if we did not take care of the problems where on January 1, 2000, computer programs, instead of reading, `January 1, 2000,' would read, `January 1, 00,' and that would be computed by many to be `1900,' not `2000.' 
It has been estimated that costs nationally and internationally could run anywhere from $300 billion to close to $2 trillion for this fix. Bob Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury, has indicated that the fix at that Department alone, excluding, I believe, the Internal Revenue Service costs, is $1.4 billion just to become compliant with the year 2000 problem by September of next year, which is when the systems ought to be on line to be tested for 2 or 3 months before January 1, 2000, occurs. 
There is an issue here that I believe the committee has tried to resolve. And my colleague from Nebraska, I know, is involved in this. And Senator Moynihan, certainly, who is a member of our special committee, has also been involved in this. And that is so we don't find our reform efforts here running into the date problem of January 1, 2000. I would argue that that all of the problems consumers could face if the IRS were not compliant by January 1, 2000 are just as critical in many ways as the problems we are addressing today. That effort has been made in this bill to try to make sure that does not happen. And I gather further from talking with Senator Bennett of Utah that provisions would be included that would allow for the Joint Taxation Committee to analyze what we are doing and that if, through the good efforts of the committee, it does not quite meet the needs, in conference we may have to move some dates a little bit. 
I am not sure I am stating this very well at all. And I see the distinguished--either one of my two colleagues might want to respond, Mr. President.

I know the Senator from Delaware, Mr. President, shares these concerns. And he has been working with Senator Moynihan, his ranking Democrat on this committee, to try to address this. And maybe he would care to comment as well as to where we stand with this.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and distinguished chairman of the committee for that point. I say we have just begun this special committee's work. We have not even had our first meetings yet. This body only authorized the expenditure of funds for this committee a few weeks ago. And there are seven of our colleagues, seven of us, who will serve on this select committee--four members from the majority and three from the minority, with Senator Bennett of Utah chairing the effort. 
We think it is an important issue that must be resolved. This committee obviously has to go forward with its reform package. And I just wanted to make sure we are on record here as saying this is a very critical issue, as the Senator from Nebraska has pointed out. 
This is one where you can't say we will fix it the second week in January or we will fix it in February of the year 2000. The IRS will have to be compliant and the Treasury will have to be compliant or we will have a huge mess on our hands.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the distinguished majority and minority have worked on this over the last number of days. I will let them speak for themselves as to their endorsement of it. 
I appreciate the chairman's efforts in this regard. I am heartened by his comments that we will have to watch this, our little committee will, and we will keep the Finance Committee well informed. If we discover something, we will let you know very promptly if some other remedial legislative action may be necessary for us to respond to this issue. This will be true of other committees, as well, I say. This is a tremendously serious issue. 
I see my colleague from Georgia has arrived on the floor, and I know Members want to move along. I am deeply grateful to the chairman and to the ranking minority member and to others for allowing us to offer this amendment. We think it will solve the problem raised here, that will minimize the dangers to the Treasury Department and the IRS noncompliance as we push reforms forward and find a crashing of the system, which, as the Senator from Nebraska has pointed out, would be, frankly, far more injurious than any of the problems we presently have. As bad as the current problems are, a total system crash would be an equally serious problem. 
I will also offer some overall remarks about the bill, which the distinguished manager and others have presented with us this afternoon. I intend to support it, and I thank them for their efforts. As soon as I have concluded those remarks, I will yield the floor and allow the distinguished chairman and ranking member here, and others, to offer whatever comments they want on this amendment and thank them. 
Mr. President, I commend my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee, especially Chairman Roth, Senator Moynihan, and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska for bringing this bill to the floor. It takes an important step forward in the effort to protect the rights of our nation's taxpayers. 
The IRS is an agency under widespread, deeply felt, and entirely justified criticism. In my view, the bill before us today is perhaps one of the most critical the Senate will vote on this session. 
It is no secret that the IRS has come under fire lately from taxpayers who, in their dealings with the agency, have experienced anger, frustration, and despair. 
The hearings conducted by the Senate Finance Committee have highlighted some of the problems at the IRS, including shoddy management, poor taxpayer service, and in some cases, reports of taxpayer abuse by IRS employees. 
No one likes to pay taxes, but taxes are a fact of life in a civilized society. Most Americans accept that fact. 
What really gets people, however, is when personnel at the agency that collects their taxes treats them with disrespect and carelessness. 
No one deserves such treatment. 
I have heard from many Connecticut constituents about what they feel is unhelpful, unreasonable, and sometimes downright unpleasant treatment by officers of the IRS. 
I've heard stories from them about calls that aren't answered, and about calls that are bounced from one person to the next, so that they never find a real answer to their questions, or receive any type of guidance or support. 
I've heard about the nightmare of the IRS losing taxpayer's checks, and then charging them interest and penalties on the very funds that the agency lost. 
The list goes on and on, Mr. President, and the more people you talk to, the more nightmares you hear. 
Every citizen who pays taxes has a right to be treated fairly, and treated as innocent until proven liable for failing to meet their legal responsibilities. Although we have taken several steps in this regard in the last few years, there is still more that can be done, and that is why I support the bill before us today. 
This legislation aims to transform this agency into an institution that provides efficient and fair service, yet still has the ability to effectively collect revenues. 
The bill includes a number of important provisions to help America's taxpayers. 
First, the legislation would shift the burden of proof away from the taxpayer, and expand the ability of taxpayers to recover costs and litigation fees. These provisions will help ensure that the IRS exercises appropriate caution and consideration prior to commencing enforcement action against any taxpayer. For too long we've seen a `shoot now, ask questions later' approach to enforcement by the IRS. These provisions are designed to see that the agency does its homework before taking any action. 
Secondly, it would establish a new IRS Oversight Board made up of six members from the private sector, the IRS Commissioner, the Secretary of the Treasury, and a member from an employee organization that represents a substantial number of IRS employees. This board would, among other things, review the operations of the IRS to ensure that our nation's taxpayers are properly treated. 
Third, this bill would establish the position of the National Taxpayer Advocate who would have a background in customer service and tax law, as well as experience representing individual taxpayers to further ensure that taxpayers are treated fairly and that their rights are not violated. In addition, the bill would create a system of local taxpayer advocates thereby making the IRS more accessible and responsive to taxpayers on a local level. 
Fourth, this legislation would provide so-called innocent spouses with a measure of relief by allowing taxpayers to elect to limit their liability to the tax attributable to their income only. I'm sure that many of my colleagues have heard stories similar to those I've heard in Connecticut, about people who have become financially wiped out when they find themselves liable for taxes, interest, and penalties because of actions by their spouse of which they were unaware. The innocent spouse provisions wold help prevent such scenarios from occurring in the future. 
Fifth, this bill would require the IRS to provide taxpayers with better information regarding taxpayer rights, potential liabilities when filing joint returns, and the appeals and collections process, and would extend the attorney-client privilege confidentiality to any individual authorized to practice before the IRS, including certified public accountants, and enrolled agents and actuaries. 
This legislation also includes a number of provisions designed to give the IRS Commissioner flexibility to make structural and personnel decisions in order to attract expertise from the private sector, redesign its salary and incentive structures to reward employees who meet objectives, and hold non-performing employees accountable. Furthermore, it requires the IRS to terminate employees for certain proven violations, chief of which are actions that mistreat taxpayers. 
Finally, while this bill gives a degree of flexibility to the IRS to make reforms internally, it also makes sure that there remains a measure of Congressional accountability by requiring the IRS Commissioner to report annually to Congress. 
Obviously, Mr. President, the IRS is in need of dire reform and we must hold it to the highest standards of efficiency and competence. 
And, while I acknowledge and applaud the good work Commissioner Rossotti has already put forth to turn this agency around, it is clear that there is much left to be done. 
The legislation before us today, which enjoys broad, bipartisan support, is a tremendous step forward in our effort to protect the rights of our nation's taxpayers, and we owe it to them to pass this bill favorably. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Lyme Disease Initiative Act of 1998, companion legislation to a bill being introduced today by Representative Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey. The objective of this bill is to put us on the path toward eradicating Lyme disease--a disease that is unfamiliar to some Americans, but one that those of us from Connecticut and the Northeast know all too well. 
Almost everyone in my state, including myself, has seen the devastating impact that this disease can have on its victims. Lyme disease can cause serious health problems, both physical and psychiatric, and can ruin a family's life. Some damage due to the disease, especially memory loss and other brain damage, is permanent. 
And we have also seen that, in many ways, efforts to educate people about this disease and to find a cure have come up short. 
The number of cases reported to the CDC increased from 500 cases in 1982 to 16,000 cases in 1996. And some reports suggest that these cases only represent the tip of the iceberg--that there are in fact tens of thousands more cases that have gone unreported or undiagnosed, due in part to the lack of a standardized diagnostic test. 
Studies indicate that long term treatment of infected individuals often exceeds $100,000 per person--a phenomenal cost to society. Because Lyme disease mimics other health conditions, patients often must visit multiple doctors before a proper diagnosis is made. This results in prolonged pain and suffering, unnecessary tests, and costly and futile treatments. But an even greater price is paid by the victims and their families--we can put no price tag on the emotional costs associated with this disease. 
But there is hope. We are close to the approval of vaccines to prevent this disease--perhaps as soon as next spring. And combined with a strong commitment to public education, we can hope that the numbers of new families affected by this terrible disease will finally begin to diminish. 
But we can't let down our guard. We can't let the promise of a vaccine to prevent Lyme disease distract us from seeking more effective ways to diagnose an treat those individuals who are already infected. 
The Lyme Disease Initiative is a $100 million federal initiative which will, for the first time, establish prominent, coordinated, federal role in Lyme disease research, treatment, and education. Various agencies within the federal government have made a good start in addressing Lyme disease concerns. These efforts have been hampered, however, by a lack of interagency coordination, inconsistent funding, and limited agency staff attention. The Lyme Disease Initiative will correct these problems. 
First, my bill calls for a 5 year plan to be established by the Secretary of Health and Human and Services, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and outside experts, to advance the treatment of and a cure for Lyme disease. This legislation also sets out four critical public health goals for advancing Lyme disease research efforts which include: the development of standardized diagnostic tests; a review of current systems for reporting cases; a study on how to improve the accuracy of diagnoses; and a campaign to educate physicians how to properly diagnose and treat Lyme disease. 
Other major provisions of the bill include establishing a Lyme Disease Taskforce to provide advice and expertise to Congress and federal agencies on all areas of Lyme disease policy; requiring that annual reports be submitted to Congress on the progress of NIH, CDC, and DoD with respect to the goals and programs funded in this bill; an authorization of $100 million over five years to ensure sufficient resources for critical, scientific research; and a request to the FDA rapidly and thoroughly review pending Lyme disease vaccine applications. 
Summer is just around the corner. My hope is that the Lyme Disease Initiative Act of 1998 will help to ensure a future where children and their families can engage in outdoor activities without the fear of contracting this dreaded disease.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues, Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Wellstone and DeWine for their tireless efforts to bring this bipartisan bill to the Senate floor. I hope that any remaining disagreements can be worked out in Conference. 
Few issues that we have a chance to debate and vote on are as critically important to the future of this country as the one before us today. The strength of our workforce is directly linked to a lifetime of quality education and training. And never have the challenges been greater. We must remain steadfast in our efforts to continue educating and training our workforce so that more of our companies can successfully adapt to the rapid developments of modern technology. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is the culmination of many years of hard work. The current maze of more than 160 separate programs which are administered by 15 separate federal agencies has become unnecessarily cumbersome for both those in need of training assistance and those employers seeking to hire skilled workers. This bill streamlines these programs by giving more authority to state and local governments, but retaining crucial federal requirements in order to ensure that the most vulnerable and deserving members of our population, including disadvantaged youth and displaced workers, receive the support and training assistance they need. This focus will ensure that these individuals have a chance to share in our nation's continued economic prosperity and growth. In addition, by emphasizing results and accountability from job training programs, our workers will be better equipped with the skills they need to land high-wage and high-skilled jobs. 
I know firsthand the struggle many hard-working individuals face as their company downsizes or scales back production. For many years, the Connecticut economy was dependent on defense-oriented industries. In the past few years, many qualified, highly skilled workers in Connecticut have lost their jobs as a result of military downsizing. In the last 12 months, more than 1,500 defense related jobs were lost in my state. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act ensures that defense employees who are adversely affected by base closings and military downsizing will have access to job training and supportive services through the National Reserve Account in title III of the Job Training Partnership Act. If these workers receive access to training, they can acquire the skills needed for employment in the technology driven economy of the 21st century. 
The Connecticut economy is changing. In February, a group of 120 business leaders stated that a highly educated and trained work force is the only way that Connecticut can capitalize on the promises of the new technology driven sectors such as software development, information technology and photonics. For too long, we were focused on job loss. It is now time to focus on the rebuilding of our economy and ensure that all potential employees, including former welfare recipients and displaced workers, receive the training and skills they need. 
I am especially pleased that a cornerstone of the job training bill will be streamlined service delivery. The bill accomplishes this integration by building on the One-Stop system to unify the patchwork of fragmented job training and employment programs into a single, customer-friendly environment. The proposed legislation would expand the concept of universal access to services for job seekers and businesses without eligibility criteria. 
Connecticut is nearing completion of implementation of its One-Stop Career Center System, Connecticut Works, which is being financed through a grant from the U.S. Department of Labor. This network has reformed the delivery of job training services in Connecticut. To date, a total of 16 centers have been created across the state and I have had the privilege of visiting many of them. Gone are the dreary unemployment centers of the past. 
Each of the centers in Connecticut offers a broad array of services including a variety of job search workshops and self-service research rooms with computer and Internet access. A wide range of written material is provided in the research rooms, and customers have access to fax machines and telephones to assist them in their job search. Enhanced and coordinated services to businesses are provided through the use of an Employer Contact Management System. Customer surveys and performance measurements ensure that customer needs are addressed. The partnership with the State library has brought access to electronic labor market and job search services through local libraries to over one hundred sites throughout Connecticut, bringing services to more customers with expanded days and hours of operation. 
Mr. President, vocational educational activities are also provided for within the Workforce legislation. Significantly, WIPA will put into place challenging performance measures to gauge the efficiency of the educational programs it oversees. These measures will require proficient training in the areas of job readiness skills, vocational skills, and placement, retention, and completion of educational opportunities. The Carl D. Perkins vocational educational title, which will separately appropriate and administer all vocational educational programs, will teach participants computer skills and new technologies to prepare them for the burgeoning high-tech labor market. 
WIPA further provides for the coordination of adult education and job training systems, allowing adult education to play a crucial role in a participant's job training program. In the area of adult education and literacy, WIPA specifically targets those communities demonstrating significant illiteracy rates to receive adult education programs on a priority basis. I am pleased that the Workforce legislation also includes a provision that will direct funds designated to support English as a Second Language (ESL) programs to those ESL programs in communities with designated need. This means that ESL programs with waiting lists--those in communities with the greatest need for the valuable services these programs provide--will receive funds on a prioritized basis. 
Mr. President, in order to better assist non-native English speakers and fully assimilate them into our society, we must help them become more fluent in English. I can think of few more important factors in determining whether or not someone new to this society will successfully make this difficult transition than their ability to speak English. 
A clear and effective grasp of the English language is still the best indicator of success for non-native English speakers. The ability to speak English for anyone in today's marketplace represents an `open door,' Mr. President. This `open door' can lead to greater employment and advancement opportunities for those whose first language is not English. 
The reauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act, offered as an amendment to the Workforce legislation, is critically important legislation that I am proud to cosponsor. The Rehabilitation Act provides comprehensive vocational rehabilitation services designed to help individuals with disabilities become more employable and achieve greater independence and integration into society. 
Under the Rehabilitation Act, States, with assistance provided by the federal government in the manner of formula-derived grants, provide a broad array of services to individuals with disabilities that includes assessment, counseling, vocational and other educational services, work related placement services, and rehabilitation technology services. In 1995 alone, Mr. President, more than 1.25 million Americans with disabilities were served by vocational rehabilitation programs. 
I am particularly pleased that a provision dealing with assistive technology was included in the reauthorization legislation. This provision, Section 508, will require the federal government to provide assistive technology to Federal employees with disabilities. This provision will put into place for the first time regulations requiring the federal government to provide its employees with disabilities with access to appropriate technology suited to their individual needs. 
This legislation would allow the federal government to take the lead in providing critical access to information technology to all federal employees with disabilities in this country. It strengthens the federal requirement that electronic and information technology purchased by federal agencies be accessible to their employees with disabilities. 
Electronic and information technology accessibility is essential for federal employees to maintain a meaningful employment experience, as well as to meet their full potential. We live in a world where information and technology are synonymous with professional advancement. Increasingly, essential job functions have come to involve the use of technology, and where it is inaccessible, job opportunities that others take for granted are foreclosed to people with disabilities. 
Presently, there are approximately 145,000 individuals with disabilities in the federal workforce. Roughly 61 percent of these employees hold permanent positions in professional, administrative, or technical occupations. Nationally, there are 49 million Americans who have disabilities, nearly half of them have a severe disability. Yet most mass market information technology is designed without consideration for their needs. 
It is critical, Mr. President, given the rapid introduction into the workforce of novel technologically-advanced products, that persons with disabilities not be allowed to fall behind. The federal government must truly be an equal opportunity employer, and this equal opportunity must apply fully to individuals with special needs. 
I view Section 508 as a hopeful first step in an effort to ensure that all individuals with disabilities have access to the assistive technology providing them the ability to reach their full ability. Though Section 508 will presently only affect federal employees, it is my hope that one day all individuals with disabilities will have the same access to assistive technology now afforded federal employees because of Section 508. 
Lastly, Mr. President, I would like to commend Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Kennedy and Wellstone for the important role they each played in making the Workforce legislation and the reauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act a reality. They worked closely with myself and my staff to address numerous concerns and for that I wish to thank them.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the sixty-fifth anniversary of the Civilian Conservation Corps, and to pay tribute to the commendable service its members offered our nation. Created by President Franklin Roosevelt on March 31, 1933, the Civilian Conservation Corps had a profound impact on this nation, helping to sustain the United States through the depths of the Depression, and setting a precedent for other federal agencies to carry on the diverse missions of the Civilian Conservation Corps. 
Within days after his presidential inauguration, Franklin Roosevelt initiated plans for the Civilian Conservation Corps, citing the need for an organization that would provide jobs for hundreds of thousands unemployed young men ages 18 to 25. President Roosevelt declared that the Civilian Conservation Corps would `conserve our precious natural resources and pay dividends to the present and future generations. More important, we can take a vast army of the unemployed out into healthful surroundings.' The Civilian Conservation Corps' intention was not only to provide services to the United States but also to give the unemployed an opportunity to live in healthful surroundings with a steady pay, room, board, and clothing. 
By July 1, 1933, a quarter of a million enrollees had enlisted in the Civilian Conservation Corps, making it the fastest large-scale mobilization of men in U.S. history. The enrollees enlisted for six months with the option to re-enroll for another six months or a maximum of two years. They worked forty-hour weeks and received thirty dollars a month. Each month, they required the men to send twenty-five dollars to their families to help them through the difficulties of the Depression. The Civilian Conservation Corps provided members with the opportunity to learn a new skill and allowed them to attend classes to further their education. More than 100,000 men were taught to read and write with the aid of the Civilian Conservation Corps's education classes. 
The accomplishments the Civilian Conservation Corps achieved in its nine year existence are impressive. Historical areas in Jamestown, Williamsburg, Yorktown, Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania were restored and developed by the Corps members. At the program's peak, there were over 500 Civilian Conservation Corps camps in national, state, and local parks. Civilian Conservation Corps workers cleared trails, built buildings and shelters, fought forest fires, planted trees, and made other improvements to parks in all the states, territories, and possessions. The three million men planted a total of 2.3 billion trees, spent 6.4 million days fighting forest fires and eradicated diseases and pests. These accomplishments contributed to the Civilian Conservation Corps' lasting environmental legacy. Today, agencies such as President Clinton's Americorps, the Park Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Forest Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service are continuing the tradition of the Civilian Conservation Corps by instilling a sense of value for our natural environment as well as for national service. 
Communities across the country benefitted from the hard toil of the Civilian Conservation Corps. The camps helped local economies, bringing large numbers of consumers to the towns' stores and industries. More importantly, they aided the communities in times of crisis, searching for missing persons, fighting fires, and offering assistance to residents during snow and ice storms. The state of Connecticut received such services from the twenty forest camps located within the state during the peak of the Corps program. 
Besides offering the members an opportunity to work, the Civilian Conservation Corps provided long-lasting friendships and ties that have endured over the sixty-five years since the Corps' inception. This sense of loyalty and pride extended to an unquestionable sense of pride for our country that is almost unparalleled. The work of the Civilian Conservation Corps remains as a monument to the young men who dedicated their lives to mending and preserving our natural resources. These men have earned the respect and honor of our nation. I offer my heartfelt thanks to the members of the Civilian Conservation Corps and congratulations on their sixty-fifth anniversary.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, later this evening the Senate will conclude debate on a resolution of ratification authorizing the United States to support the entry of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). 
The decision that the Senate takes with respect to this resolution will have an historic impact on the future of Europe and the nature of the Transatlantic partnership that will take us into the next millennium. 
Without question, NATO has been the singularly most successful alliance for mutual defense in modern history since its establishment in 1949. For nearly fifty years it has served as a bulwark against communism, and as a deterrent against threats posed by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact satellites. 
Today the world has changed. The Soviet Union no longer exists, and the Warsaw Pact is fast becoming a mere footnote in our history books. In that context, it seems to me to be a particularly appropriate moment to review whether and how NATO's role should evolve, to keep pace with the changing political landscape. 
Some changes have already been undertaken by NATO. For example, not too long ago NATO members agreed that it was an appropriate mission for NATO forces to assist with efforts to implement the Dayton Peace accords in war torn Bosnia. 
Certainly the debate this week is as much about such matters as it is whether Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic will be good NATO partners. 
The debate is also about the merits of admitting additional members beyond these three--and the order and timing for doing so. And, it is about the budgetary implications of an enlarged organization with an expanded land area requiring collective defense. Finally, it is about the impact on U.S. and NATO's relations with Russia and other NIS countries and the implications for internal Russian political stability. 
These are all important and legitimate areas for discussion. The Senate's debate on these questions has been thoughtful and constructive. Senators Warner, Moynihan, Harkin and others have asked some very important questions that deserve answers before moving forward to take NATO from 16 to nineteen members and beyond. It would be foolhardy not to carefully assess these matters before making changes to NATO. 
I agree with those who have held up a yellow flag urging caution. Certainly it behooves us to act judiciously in reshaping NATO to ensure that whatever we do does not undermine the effectiveness or efficiency of the current organization. Nor should we foster expectations in Eastern and Central Europe that cannot be fulfilled--or create additional and unnecessary financial burdens on existing or new members. 
I also believe that it is important that we take into account the implications for our current and future relations with Russia and other former Soviet states. And particularly with respect to Russia's continued willingness to move 
forward to ratify Start II and other future arms control agreements. 
While I agree with those who suggest it would be wrong to give Moscow veto power over NATO decisions--on the other hand, I see nothing to be gained from causing unnecessary uncertainty or anxiety with respect to our intentions toward Russia. 
After the many hours of debate we have had on the pending measure, I believe a strong case has been made in favor of admitting these three new members. Foreign policy experts and scholars who have spent a great deal of time studying NATO over the years make a persuasive case in support of expansion. 
I also believe that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, together with other Clinton Administration officials, have during hours and hours of Congressional testimony made a very compelling case in favor of ratification of the pending protocols. Former Presidents Bush and Carter have endorsed the President's decision. As have a number of our distinguished former Secretaries of State and former members of the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff. They have also adequately addressed concerns that have been raised with respect to NATO expansion. 
During the July 8, 1997 Madrid Summit, NATO heads of state, including President Clinton reached common agreement at that time to invite Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to join the organization, while leaving open the door to other interested governments. However, no commitment was made with respect to the sequence or timing of such additions. 
That was appropriate in my view. It goes without saying that we must assess any impact of enlarging NATO by three on that organization's ability to continue to fulfill its primary mission--namely collective self-defense--before moving forward to consider additional new members. 
Realistically, such an assessment is likely to take three or more years by my estimation--in line with the time frame fame Senators Warner and Moynihan have included in their so called pause reservation. Having said that, I really do not think it necessary to codify this time frame into a binding proposition. In fact, the time period could even turn out to be longer than three years. Were we to codify the time period, we might in fact be creating false expectations in the minds of countries waiting to join that invitations will automatically be forthcoming once three years have elapsed. It was for those reasons that I voted against this amendment earlier today. 
It is important as we review the current structure, purpose, and membership of this important organization that we remain mindful of the central proposition--the organization's relevance to today's and tomorrow's realities. We should ask as well whether and what changes best further U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. Only after such questions have been fully explored should we move forward to alter NATO. 
I believe that during the course of the current debate we have exhaustively reviewed the implications and U.S. interests at stake with respect to the pending protocols. I am satisfied that the addition of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to NATO will enhance U.S. national security and foreign policy interests by strengthening and fostering European unity and security. 
There is little doubt in my mind, Mr. President, about the likely outcome of the final vote on this matter. In my judgement the United States Senate will give its advice and consent to ratification, and thereby authorize the United States to consent to the admission of these three members. 
Mr. President, I will join my colleagues in voting aye on this matter. To do otherwise would severely undermine the cohesive support that has existed for NATO since its establishment in 1949 and leave us ill prepared to promote a strong, secure, and united Europe in the 21st century.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the conference report on H.R. 1757--The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998. 
As is the case with many of my colleagues who have already spoken on this matter, I believe that it is fundamentally wrong to be holding the payment of U.N. arrears and the structural reform of U.S. foreign affairs organization hostage to a single issue related to international family planning--an issue by the way which was never even discussed during Senate consideration of this legislation. I am speaking of course of the so called Mexico City restrictions on U.S. international population programs that have been included in the legislation pending before us today--Section 1816 of the bill. These restrictions not only prohibit foreign non-governmental organizations that accept U.S. funding from using their own funds to perform abortions, but also bar them from lobbying their own governments, with their own money, on abortion related public policy issues. 
Without doubt, Section 1816 is going to result in all of the other sections in the bill, over 160 of them--not becoming law. 
That means that nearly two years of work on this bill will have been for naught. That is unfortunate in my view, because many of the other provisions are meritorious and should become law. 
Mr. President, how did we get to where we find ourselves with respect to this legislation? Mr. President, let's be clear about who is responsible. It was not the President who created the current dynamic--he and officials in his administration have worked in good faith for months with House and Senate conferees on the legislation before us today. 
It certainly wasn't the Senate conferees who working together had come up with an acceptable package of compromises on the various difference between the House and Senate passed bills --a package that we all more or less agreed to and would have supported. A package that did not include Mexico City language. 
The responsibility for putting U.S. leadership at the U.N. in jeopardy and delaying foreign affairs reorganization rests solely with the House Republican leadership. 
The Republican leadership knew full well that this entire bill was being put at risk with the inclusion of Section 1816 in this bill--a provision which, incidentally, would never become law if it were to be applied to domestic non-governmental organizations because it is so fundamentally a violation of the first amendment constitutional protections of free speech. 
I know our Democratic colleagues in the House warned them of what was likely to happen. 
I know Senator Biden did as well. Certainly the President has made no secret of his fundamental opposition to the so called Mexico City language and most especially the `global gag rule' aspect of it. 
Despite these warnings, the House leadership instructed House Republican conferees to include this provision in the final version of the bill. Not a single Democratic conferee from either the House or Senate supported the final conference report that we have before us today. I was one of those conferees who refused to sign onto this legislation. 
I certainly agree with those who are strongly opposed to the codification of the Mexico City language into law. I think it is reprehensible to attempt to restrict the free speech of foreign non-governmental organizations and their members. 
I happen to believe that these organizations do very important work--work that is making a real difference to the health and over all quality of life for hundreds of millions of women and children living in developing countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America. 
But my objections with respect to this matter go beyond the substance of the provision to that of the tactics that are being used here and for an unwillingness to take into account U.S. national and foreign policy interests that may be at stake. Proponents of this measure have made no effort to balance these overarching interests against the narrower ones of wanting to score partisan political points by promoting a very controversial agenda that clearly does not have the support of the majority of the American people. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that the Senate will vote to reject the pending conference report and thereby send a signal that, at least in the Senate, we aren't in the practice of `legislative hostage taking'--that is not the way the Senate conducts its business. In doing so, we will also be sending a signal to the American people that we are here to do their business, the business that we were elected to look out for, and not to play games of `partisan one upmanship.' I would urge my colleagues to join me in sending such a message by voting no on this measure.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there are few issues as important as protecting our citizens and keeping our communities free of crime. Americans should feel secure in their homes, at their schools, and in their neighborhoods, and in recent years we have made tremendous progress in this area, reducing the crime rate for a record five years in a row. But more work needs to be done. One of the most effective ways to make our streets safer is attracting talented and committed individuals to work in law enforcement. That is why I am so pleased that my Senate colleagues have displayed great wisdom and unanimously confirmed Stephen C. Robinson to serve as U.S. Attorney for the State of Connecticut. 
Mr. Robinson has extensive and varied law enforcement experience in the public sector and his legal and investigative work for the private sector well qualify him to serve in this position. I was proud to recommend his nomination to the President, and I believe that he will bring a sense of intelligence, integrity, and energy to this office. 
After graduating from Cornell University and Cornell Law School, Mr. Robinson was in private practice for several years. He then became an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York where he directed the prosecution of narcotics cases and tax fraud and securities fraud cases. He also argued appeals in the U.S. Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit. In 1990, Mr. Robinson received the Department of Justice's Director Award for Superior Performance as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. 
Mr. Robinson also has served as Associate General Counsel and Managing Director at Kroll Associates, the world's largest private investigation firm. In 1993, FBI Director Louis Freeh asked Mr. Robinson to join the Bureau as his Special Assistant and General Counsel. At the FBI, he oversaw counter-terrorism and counter-espionage policy and investigation; revision of the selection and promotion process for Special Agents; and FBI undercover investigation proposals. Mr. Robinson has most recently worked as Chief Compliance Officer for Aetna U.S. Healthcare in Middletown, Connecticut, and he is also an instructor of Trial Practice Law at Yale Law School. 
Mr. Robinson's confirmation is particularly significant in Connecticut, because he is the first African-American to ever serve as our State's top federal prosecutor. He has spoken publicly about the sense of hopelessness amongst young blacks throughout the country. And having grown up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, Mr. Robinson hopes that young people from inner cities will look at him and see someone who can not only relate to their circumstances, but who also illustrates that if you get your education and work hard you can attain your goals, regardless of where you come from. Mr. Robinson stands as a positive role model for African-American youths, and in fact all young people. 
By taking the post of Connecticut's U.S. Attorney, Mr. Robinson is renewing his connection to public service. But this may have never been possible were it not for a conversation between Steve and his mother in 1996. During the Thanksgiving holidays, his mother encouraged him to return to public service and give more back to his community. Mr. Robinson has frequently stated that this conversation prompted him to reevaluate what he wanted to do with his life. Upon reflection, he decided to take his mother's advice, and he decided that he should return to public service. On behalf of the people of Connecticut, I would like to thank Steve's mother. Steve Robinson is a man of outstanding character and intelligence, and we are fortunate to have him serve as our next U.S. Attorney. 
I offer my sincere congratulations to Steve, his wife Kathleen Sullivan, his daughter Victoria, and all of his family and friends on his well-deserved confirmation. I have every confidence that he will flourish in this position.

Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I offer this resolution on behalf of myself, Senators Kennedy, Moynihan; the Democrat leader, Senator Daschle; Senator Leahy; Senator Lautenberg; Senator Kerry; Senator Mack; Senator D'Amato; Senator Harkin; and Senator Biden. 
Mr. President, today we are here considering this resolution when there are renewed hopes for peace in Northern Ireland, hopes that spring from the successful conclusion of 22 months of negotiations on April 10, Good Friday. I do not think it was mere coincidence that it was during Holy Week, one of the most sacred periods in the Christian calendar, that this small miracle occurred, the possibility of peace, political stability, and reconciliation for the 1.6 million people who reside in the six counties of Northern Ireland. Many people deserve credit and congratulations for making this small miracle possible. 
First, we should commend the individuals who participated in the peace process for more than 3 years and stayed the course. It took courage on their parts, as Senator Mitchell noted, `to compete in the arena of democracy.' 
I think it is fair to say that one of the giants over the years in Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland peace efforts has been John Hume of Derry, a long-time civil rights crusader and respected leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party. John Hume deserves great praise for his tireless efforts over the past 30 years to bring peace to his people. David Trimble, president of the Ulster Unionist Party, and Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, were also indispensable in making a final agreement possible. 
They, along with other participants, deserve enormous credit for their persistence and determination, for their willingness to make honorable compromises so that the people of Ireland can look forward to a day when hatred and bloodshed are not part of their daily landscape. 
Let me also take a moment, if I may, to mention a few of the other key actors in this drama who warrant special recognition. First, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who made the search for peace one of his first priorities upon assuming office last year. He did so because he believed that the people of Belfast `deserve a better future than a life of bloodshed, murder and disharmony.' 
Equally important to the success of the process was the Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, also was new to the office, who inspired trust and confidence in the nationalist community. They knew of his commitment to ensuring that any final agreement would protect and guarantee the rights, freedoms, and traditions of the Irish Catholic minority in the north. 
It goes without saying that the American people can be justifiably proud of the role played by President Clinton throughout the process. Were it not for the President's vision, perseverance, and unwillingness to give up on the negotiations, we would not be here today talking about a new chapter in the history of Northern Ireland. 
Perhaps President Clinton refused to be discouraged because he had looked into the eyes of so many men and women during his visit to Belfast in 1995 and saw how deeply they yearned for peace, most especially peace for their children. 
Last but not least, there was Senator George Mitchell, our former colleague, who shepherded the parties to an agreement. As someone who served with Senator Mitchell, it came as no surprise to me that George found a way to overcome what at times appeared to be insurmountable differences among the parties. 
With patience, evenhandedness and acute political skills, Senator Mitchell guided and empowered the parties to find common ground and finalize an agreement. 
The tireless efforts of Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith should also be acknowledged. She was there at every turn to keep everyone focused on what was happening throughout the process, and to ensure that at appropriate moments, the necessary encouragement from the United States was forthcoming. 
I should mention as well that our own colleague, Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, played a very, very important role over many years to encourage a political and peaceful resolution of the problems in the north. 
There have been others of our colleagues here in this Chamber, Senator Moynihan of New York, Senator Leahy of Vermont, Senator Mack of Florida, and in the other body Peter King of New York, Congressman Neal of Massachusetts, Ben Gilman, of New York, Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts all of whom have been deeply committed to finding a peaceful solution to Ireland's Troubles. I know there are others as well, but these are the names that come to mind immediately who, for many, many years sought to bring about a political and peaceful resolution to the violence in the north. 
The 67-page final document is a complex mosaic of provisions that endeavors to address the interests and concerns of the two Northern Ireland communities, Protestant and Catholic, within a framework of democracy, justice and equal rights. 
The April 10 agreement is in many ways the culmination of more than a decade of efforts by the British and Irish governments to broker peace in the conflicted North. The 1985 Anglo-Irish Accord, the 1993 Joint Declaration, and the 1995 New Framework for Agreement were all important milestones on the road to peace. 
Perhaps the secret of success on this occasion was that all of the parties to the conflict were represented in the negotiations--each side setting forth for itself its concerns and aspirations. Those concerns and aspirations have in turn been interwoven into the final text of the accord. 
The August 1994, IRA cease-fire and the cease-fire by the Combined Loyalist Military Command that followed shortly thereafter created the opportunity for these all inclusive negotiations to take place. 
There were clearly anxious moments over the last several years during the quest for peace. To be sure, at times the setbacks and disappointments that followed the promise of the 1994 cease-fire announcements, left all of us despairing that the situation was without hope. 
You will recall, for example, that the peace process was dealt a near fatal blow on February 9, 1996, with the detonation of an IRA bomb in London--a blast that injured scores of innocent people. 
Frankly, until the restoration of the IRA cease-fire last July, the Northern Ireland peace process had hit bottom, it had reached the point where, in the words of Irish poet Seamus Heaney, `bad news is no longer news.' 
We are now once again at a turning point in the history of Northern Ireland. The possibility of peace is as real as it has ever been. 
As President Clinton has so aptly observed, `to engage in serious negotiations, to be willing to make principled compromises, requires courage and creativity.' 
The political leaders of Northern Ireland demonstrated that courage and creativity in finalizing this agreement. 
It is now up to the people of Ireland--North and South--to ratify that agreement in the upcoming referendums. More importantly, it rests in their hands and hearts to make the words on that 67-page peace accord make a difference in the daily lives of every man, woman and child who calls Northern Ireland home. 
On this day and in this Chamber, with what I hope will be the unanimous endorsement of every one of our colleagues, I pray, as everyone else does, that the people of Northern Ireland will have the courage, wisdom and foresight to do that. 
Mr. President, I know my colleague, Senator Kennedy, is here on the floor. If there is additional time, I ask unanimous consent for another 5 or 10 additional minutes for people to be heard on this issue if it is appropriate.

Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. 
Mr. President, I had not intended to speak on this amendment. I have an amendment coming up that I will be addressing. But I think it is such an important amendment that our colleague from Michigan has raised here. I think all of us have become much more highly sensitized to the critical importance of the generation of students in our country who are computer literate. It is no longer a question of whether or not that technology and the awareness of it is going to be important. It is critical. I have made the assertion that what keyboards and computers bring to this generation is tantamount to what a ballpoint pen brought to my generation. Any child today not completing elementary and secondary school without being computer literate is going to be totally unprepared for the 21st century economy. 
Our colleague from Michigan has made it possible for the teachers of our Nation, who truly would like to become better prepared to instruct young people in the importance of this technology, to have the wherewithal to do so. This ought not to be a partisan debate in any way. It is a very thoughtful amendment, one that we all can be deeply proud of. 
We are only some 500 days away from a new millennium, and Senator Levin has offered us a chance to make a difference for young people so that they might be able to acquire these skills. I commend him for the amendment and hope our colleagues will support it. 
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have in front of me a chart which demonstrates what I think most Members of this body are familiar with; that is, the rising cost of special education in our country and the rising population of students who are requiring special education services. 
Presently, for the special education needs of America, 55 percent of the cost is being borne by our States, and 35 percent is being borne by local governments and local property taxes, and roughly 10 percent by the Federal Government. It is the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), endorsed and supported by those of us here in Congress, which rightly encourages and provides for the inclusion of all children who require special education services in the educational process of this Nation. 
It is worthy of note that at the time the U.S. Congress passed the IDEA legislation, it was recommended that the Federal Government would provide 40 percent of the costs of special education services. Several decades later, the Federal Government is presently only contributing 10 percent of the costs of special education. Mr. President, special education costs are rising. We are told nationally that these numbers are moving up. In 1991, special education costs were 17 percent of the overall education budget; they are now 19 percent of the overall education budget. 
I might also point out that the amount being spent on regular education has dropped to 56 percent, down from 58 percent. Also, the population of special needs children is on the increase. The overall population of children in elementary and secondary schools has gone up about 7.3 percent in the last few years, whereas the number of children requiring special education services has jumped over 12 percent in the same period of time. We have rising costs, rising population, and the Federal commitment to special education has remained static. 
I mention this because I am offering an amendment that, with all due respect to my colleague from Georgia, would take the $1.6 billion from tax proposal that would provide $37 or $7 in tax relief for private and public school families, respectively, and use that money to lower the cost at the local and State level for special education services. If the Federal Government is to meet its full commitment of 40 percent to special education, it would need to provide $16 billion to state and local school districts, more than four times the current funding. 
Let me quickly add that I commend the Budget Committee and others in recent weeks and months who have actually increased spending on special education. The total commitment to States is slightly lower than $4 billion but is still substantially less than the $16 billion needed to meet the 40-percent commitment. 
I believe, given the scarce funding available to us, is that we would be far wiser, with all due respect to the authors of this underlying proposal, to take that $1.6 billion and give it back to the States and local governments to reduce the rising cost of special education in this country. 
We are told that the underlying bill is about choice. I argue there should be no choice when the needs of children with disabilities are involved. Private schools can simply accept or reject students that they want or don't want. If your child is a special needs child, you don't have a choice whether you would like to go to a private school. The only school system that has to take you is a public school system. Parents with children with special needs don't have those choices. Property taxpayers, sales taxpayers, and State income taxpayers don't have any choice; they have to pay their tax bills. 
The only people I know of at this very moment who have a choice about education are the 100 of us in this body. We have a choice to take $1.6 billion and provide a $37 tax break for private school students and their families, a $7 tax break for the public school students and their families, or we can help state and local school districts by providing them with $320 per special needs child so that they can provide valuable special education services. That is what my amendment does. It is saying, let's make a choice with rare funding dollars and apply them to help special needs children. 
Let me share how big a cost this is and point out the situation in a number of States. In Colorado, the State must pay a 60-percent share for special education services. In Connecticut, the State provides 59 percent of special education funding. In Maine, 33 percent; Michigan, 60 percent; Missouri, 60 percent; Rhode Island, 59 percent; Virginia, 68 percent. These are huge costs at the State and local level. I have one community in my State, Torrington, CT, where 2 years ago the bill was $635,000 for special education services. Two years later, it has risen to $1.3 million. Mr. President, the costs associated with special education can often be staggering. 
What I am saying is, if we think this is a national goal, to do something about special education, then we ought to be willing to help our local towns and our States to reduce their share of special education costs. The $1.6 billion that my amendment would provide is not going to pay the entire bill. It is, however, a move in the right direction. 
But when you have very scarce funding, wouldn't it be wiser for us to make the choice here today to reduce property and State taxes, by saying here is $1.6 billion, which we know is not going to solve the whole problem, but I want to give that money back to the States, back to the local governments, to bring down the cost of special education services. 
We made that promise, Mr. President. We said decades ago we would provide 40 percent of the cost of special education, and we have never provided more than 10 percent. There is a chance for us today to provide, not $37, not $7 after taxes, but a $320 per child tax break in terms of reducing the cost of providing special education services. 
It seems to me this would be a far wiser way for us to spend our money. I say after-tax dollars because I think there is some confusion. Again, I say this with all due respect to the authors of the underlying bill. But the $2,000 IRA contained in Senator Coverdell's legislation is an after-tax proposal. It provides as much as if you put $2,000 in a savings account and the interest that it earns, that is the money you get the tax break on, not the $2,000 principle. So when I say it provides a $37 and $7 tax break, those are real numbers. 
Recently, I looked at what the cost of private schools is in the greater Washington, DC, area. They run anywhere from $10,000 to $17,000 annually. Why are we providing a $37 tax break for families who are already sending their children to schools that expensive when the $1.6 billion specified in this legislation could help lower property taxes and assist with special education? 
Recently, when speaking with mayors in Connecticut, they often mentioned the high cost of special education services. By not contributing 40 percent of special education costs, we are pitting families against each other in these communities. I think every one of us probably knows someone, maybe in our own families, that has a special needs child. We know the concern, the fear, that a family goes through in discovering that a child requires special education services. It is a critically important issue. But I am also aware of what happens in a community where you only have a handful of special needs students and all of a sudden their services cost a bit more and people get upset because it is their tax dollars that are paying for that education. The school systems in our states need our assistance. 
What we are offering here is some relief to State and local school systems. It is not total relief. We have $1.6 billion over 10 years, what are we going to do with the taxpayers' money of this country? Do we give it back to the communities in Connecticut and elsewhere that are struggling to meet the cost of special education? Or do I write a $37 check to someone who is sending their child to a school that is costing $10,000 or $13,000 or $14,000 a year? I don't know how you justify it. I don't know how I can explain to my constituents not providing some relief to their school systems for an area of great concern and importance--special education. 
That is the choice I get to make here in the next few minutes. Do we take these dollars and return them to our States, return them to our towns, trying to make a real difference for special education, or do we take them to provide minor tax relief. 
Now, again, let me mention briefly the role of public and private education. At this very hour, all across our country, even on the west coast where the Presiding Officer is from, children have started school. There are 53 million children in elementary and secondary schools at this very hour all across our country; 48 million of them are in public schools and 5 million are in private schools. So we are talking about $1.6 billion, $37 of which goes to students in those private schools, $7 of which goes for those in public schools. 
I am a product in many ways of private education. My parents made that choice. I respect them for having made it. However, my parents never thought they should get a tax break for doing so. They understood that this Nation had a special obligation to public education and particularly the families with special needs children. I had to be accepted to the private schools I attended. They didn't have to take me. Private schools can reject anyone they want. Public schools cannot. Public schools must accept these children. And you have that family that has done everything right and, unfortunately, has a situation with a child who requires special education services, and they, of course, want that child to succeed. They don't have the choice of going to a private school. Private school is not going to take that cost on. They have to attend a public school. Let us try to provide the valuable resources specified by this legislation to our local communities to help that family receive special education services for their child, to say to the other property taxpayers in that town that we are going to provide the 40 percent of special education costs we promised we would and never have. 
One hundred of us here in the next 20 minutes or 15 minutes will be given the choice of deciding which is a higher priority. It is not a question of we would like to do everything. We can't do everything. But, we have $1.6 billion and we are going to decide in the next 15 minutes where it is going to go. 
Does it go toward a $37 tax break for someone who has their child enrolled in a private school, or does it come back to that community in my State and other States all across this country to provide some needed tax relief--at $320 per child--to begin the process of lowering the cost of special education services and making a difference in our towns and for these families. That is really the choice. That's the real choice we have before us today. 
Mr. President, let me ask how much time I have remaining.

Mr. DODD. I thank my good friend from Rhode Island. Mr. President, I understand there will be a point of order raised against this amendment. I regret that, because I am not asking to spend any more money than the underlying amendment does, but I realize this is a point of order that will be sustained. I will make an appropriate motion to vote on that. 
I am sorry that is going to be the case, because I really do believe that this is the one opportunity, a chance, after we all talked about trying to do something, about reducing the cost to communities, to make the choice to do so. But I need 60 votes, I am afraid, to prevail on all of that. When the appropriate motion is made, I will respond to it. I hope that will not be the case. I hope we can have an up-or-down vote as we have had on every other amendment. 
I believe my time has expired, and if it has, I believe my 
colleague wants to make an appropriate motion.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, several days ago, our colleague in the other body, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, announced his retirement after 12 years of service. Representative Kennedy has been a tremendous advocate on behalf of the nation's working families, and I want to take this opportunity to say a few words about my friend from Massachusetts. 
Joe Kennedy has brought an uncommon enthusiasm and an intensity to his work here in the Congress. As a member of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, he mastered the arcane details of banking, insurance, securities, and housing law to achieve great success in reforming our nation's financial institutions to be more responsive to the needs of working families. 
In 1989, he authored amendments to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the Community Reinvestment Act. These amendments have been responsible for leveraging hundreds of millions of dollars in credit to help people of modest means purchase a home. 
As the Chairman of the former Subcommittee on Consumer Credit and Insurance, he worked on legislation to reform the Fair Credit Reporting Act, so that consumers will be better protected from unwarranted uses of their most private financial information and will have a greater ability to safeguard the confidentiality and accuracy of that information. 
More recently, as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, he has continued to champion affordable housing for the elderly and others on fixed incomes. Thanks to his efforts, many more Americans own a home and have a decent, affordable place to live. 
Congressman Kennedy has distinguished himself in other ways, as well. He has been a consistent and articulate voice for peace and justice in places like Northern Ireland, Haiti, and the Mexican state of Chiapas. He has been a staunch supporter of civil rights for women, the disabled, and minorities. He has also worked hard to balance our nation's budget without compromising our commitment to protect our most vulnerable citizens. 
Prior to his election to the House, Congressman Kennedy built a successful company that provides low-cost heating oil and other services to low and moderate income Americans. It is to that company that he will soon return. 
I have no doubt that although he is leaving public office, Joe Kennedy will continue to serve the public interest. I know I speak for many of my colleagues in wishing him and his family well in this new endeavor, and in saying that, we in the Congress will miss his vitality and vision of a more just and prosperous America.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to sadly acknowledge the passing of a friend, former colleague, and one of the most passionate, committed, and colorful individuals that the Congress and this country has ever known: Bella Abzug. 
Many people view 1920 as one of the most important years in the history of women in America, not only because it was the year that women finally gained the right to vote, but also because it's the year that Bella Abzug was born. 
When we think of the struggle for women's equality in this country, one of the first images that comes to mind is that of Bella Abzug's wide-brimmed hat bobbing up and down at some march or rally. Through her flamboyant personality, she truly became an icon and a giant in the American and worldwide political landscape. 
Bella Abzug was a trailblazer. She graduated from law school at a time when only 2 percent of all lawyers were women. She was the first Jewish woman ever elected to Congress and one of only 12 women in the House when she was elected. 
She helped pave the way for other women in Congress and in all walks of life. In fact, just the other day, my good friend and colleague from Connecticut, Barbara Kennelly, spoke on the House floor about how Bella Abzug inspired her to run for Congress. One can only imagine how many other women took a chance and sought to achieve great things because they were inspired by Bella Abzug. 
An important thing to note about Bella is that her work was by no means limited to the cause of women's equality. Her titles ranged from civil rights lawyer to anti-war activist, just to name a few. Just three years out of law school, she went to Mississippi and weathered threats from white-supremacist groups to defend a black man in a highly contentious trial. In the 1950s, she shouted down former Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist witch hunts. On her first day as a Congresswoman, she introduced a resolution to withdraw all U.S. troops from Southeast Asia. In 1975, she introduced legislation in Congress to prohibit discrimination against homosexuals. Bella Abzug was committed to eradicating all forms of injustice in this country and around the world. Hers was not solely the cause of women; hers was the cause she believed to be right and believed to be just. 
I was fortunate to see a side of Bella Abzug that most people never saw. I served in the House with Bella during her last term, and I came to know her as a person of great kindness. Beneath the persona of a blustery and irascible New York City politician was a woman of great decency and warmth. While we only served together for one term, I have had numerous occasions over the years to visit with Bella, and I truly appreciated her kindness and her friendship. Bella Abzug was truly one of a kind, and she will be dearly missed by friends, family, and those whose causes she championed over the years.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my views on the budget resolution. I commend the Budget Committee on the job it has done. Chairman Domenici and Senator Lautenberg should be praised for their efforts to bring a bill to the floor that balances the budget for the first time in 30 years. And yet, this resolution fails to adequately address some of our nation's most pressing priorities, including child care, education, and health care. 
First, however, I would like to take a moment to discuss how we reached this historic moment when, for the first time since 1969, we present the American people with a budget that is in balance. The balanced budget we have today is a result of the hard work and progress we have made over the past few years to reduce the deficit. The effort dates back to 1990 when President Bush--despite strong opposition from his own party--boldly endorsed a plan that lowered the deficit by $500 billion and started us down the road to fiscal responsibility. 
This effort was then continued by President Clinton in 1993 when he proposed a far-reaching economic plan, which is more appropriately called the Balanced Budget Plan of 1993. This balanced budget plan, which I supported, was enacted into law without a single Republican vote and has helped to reduce the deficit from $290 billion at the beginning of 1993 to an anticipated surplus this year. Despite the claims by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that President Clinton's plan would doom our economy, this economic plan has put us on a road to solid recovery. It has reduced deficits by more than $1 trillion, led us to the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years, created 15 million new jobs, and resulted in the greatest number of Americans owning homes ever. 
Most recently, Mr. President, we finished the job of balancing the budget when we enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which I supported, not only reduced spending, but also cut taxes for the first time in 16 years, providing much-needed tax relief for working families. I was very pleased to support the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 because it protected our priorities such as fiscal discipline, child care, education, health care, and the environment. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, the resolution before us today fails to protect these priorities and turns its back on America's families and children. It fails to recognize many initiatives important to our children and families including quality child care, reducing class sizes, renovating and modernizing our children's schools, and promoting after-school learning. 
The resolution provides no mandatory funding for either child care or early childhood education. Moreover, it explicitly excludes President Clinton's proposals to use any revenues from comprehensive tobacco legislation to pay for initiatives for children, including child care, anti-smoking education, children's health care, and improvements in education. 
Clearly, the resolution before us shortchanges children, and that is why I offered an amendment to establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund which could be used to fund legislation designed to improve the affordability, availability and quality of child care, and to support families' choices in caring for their children. I was disappointed, obviously, when my amendment was defeated, but was pleased that the amendment had the support of fifty of my colleagues. 
The resolution also reduces funding for the Administration's education priorities by $2 billion, and as a result, about 450,000 students could be denied safe after-school care in 1999, some 30,000 new children could be denied access to the Head Start program, and 6,500 middle schools would not have drug and violence prevention coordinators. And yet, while Republican budget increases funding above the President's request for Impact Aid, Special Education, and the title VI block grant, these increases come at the expense of many other priorities that also strengthen our commitment to children and education. 
Mr. President, this budget as a whole ill-serves children and families, and that is why I was pleased to support the Democratic alternative budget offered by Senator Lautenberg. The Democratic alternative would strengthen our commitment to our priorities by providing funding for key initiatives such as hiring an additional 100,000 teachers, creating more after-school programs, and doubling the number of children who receive child care assistance. Further, the Democratic alternative moves us toward our goal of one million children in Head Start by 2002, doubles the number of children in early Head Start, and places up to 500,000 children in after school learning centers. 
In addition, Mr. President, the Democratic alternative maintains our commitment to other Democratic priorities such as cleaning up the environment and investing in our transportation infrastructure. Moreover, it would expand Medicare coverage to Americans ages 55-65. And not least, Mr. President, the Democratic alternative strengthens Social Security by reserving the entire unified budget surplus, while maintaining strict fiscal discipline by meeting the discretionary caps in all years. 
I regret, Mr. President, that the Democratic alternative was defeated. And I regret that the resolution before us today is not one that I, in good conscience, can support. In my view, the Republican budget shortchanges America's working families. I am, however, hopeful that as we move forward in the budget process, we will craft legislation that focuses on priorities like child care, education, health care, and the environment. Finally, Mr. President, in our efforts to craft a budget that targets the needs of working families, it is imperative that we remain vigilant in our efforts to maintain fiscal responsibility.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a remarkable woman who was hailed as the `grand dame of community action' by her local paper upon her passing: Willene Everett of Meriden, Connecticut. Sadly, Mrs. Everett died this past summer at the age of 74. 
For 31 years, Mrs. Everett worked at the Meriden Community Action Agency, where she headed the Elderly Nutrition Program for 15 years and the children's Summer Lunch Program for 10 years. She packed a lifetime worth of achievement into her tenure at the Agency, but her life was filled with many great experiences and accomplishments before she took this job. 
Her job experience ranged from working as a beautician to a mortician. And perhaps the most noteworthy of these was her experience in the military, where she served in France, Germany and England during World War II as a Staff Sergeant in the U.S. Army. 
But most of us in Connecticut will always associate Willene Everett with her work at the Community Action Center in Meriden. During her 31 year tenure, she made countless contributions. She helped to feed 1,500 people a day--both young and old. She also took the time to do the little things that brighten people's lives: sending birthday or get well cards to patrons of the Center, setting up a recipe exchange at work, traveling through snow storms to make sure that people at the Center had their breakfast and coffee. 
Her work extended far beyond the Senior Center. She was President of `The Laurel Club,' a social club known for its charitable work and efforts to provide scholarship funds for young African-Americans in the Meriden area. She was also active in the local NAACP and YWCA. 
Her efforts did not go unrecognized. She was invited to and attended a White House Conference on Aging African-Americans during the Carter Administration. Among her awards, she received the YWCA's `Woman in Leadership Award,' the `Woman of the Year' by the Girls' Club, and the `State of Connecticut General Assembly Award' in recognition of her civic and charitable work. In addition, the dining hall at the Seniors Center in Meriden has been named `Willene's Place' and a scholarship fund bearing her name is being established in her honor. 
By renaming the dining hall and creating this scholarship fund, Willene Everett's name will carry on. But for those who knew her, there is no need for any form of tribute to ensure her remembrance. She was a caring and compassionate person, and she will never be forgotten by the people of Meriden, whose lives she touched and brightened. 
Willene Everett is survived by her husband Edward and her children JoAnn and Steven. She was a loving wife and mother, and this year would have actually marked her 50th wedding anniversary. She is dearly missed, and I offer my heartfelt condolences to her family.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Jeffords, in introducing the Health Care Personal Information Nondisclosure (PIN) Act of 1998. This legislation is designed to offer Americans the peace of mind that comes with knowing that their most personal and private medical information is protected from misuse and exploitation. 
Medicine has changed dramatically since the time Norman Rockwell painted the scene of a doctor examining his young patient's doll. The flow of medical information is no longer confined to doctor-patient conversations and hospital charts. Recent technological advances have introduced more efficient methods of organizing data that allow information to be shared instantaneously--helping to contain costs--and even save lives. The national database of medical information provides a prime example of the benefits of these advances. Through the use of a simple computer, emergency room doctors are now equipped with a quick and inexpensive means of accessing the medical records needed to properly treat unconscious patients. 
Unfortunately, as we saw all too clearly just a few months ago, our laws have not kept pace with technology. In February the Washington Post exposed the activities of two pharmacies that were sharing personal medical information about prescription drug use with unauthorized third parties. And, most disturbingly, these actions were perfectly legal. Clearly, the existing patchwork of state laws protecting medical records are proving to be inadequate to address the public's concerns. 
These concerns are so strong that in some cases they threaten to actually negate the benefits of advances in medicine and technology. The fear of discrimination and exploitation has led some ethnic communities with susceptibility to certain conditions to urge their members to avoid genetic testing. The fear that sensitive medical information might be released without authorization has led patients to avoid full disclosure of mental health concerns to their physicians and to unnecessarily forego opportunities for treatment. 
I believe that the Health Care PIN Act offers the privacy protections that the public demands. This legislation sets clear guidelines for the use and disclosure of medical information by health care providers, researchers, insurers, employers and others. The Health Care PIN Act provides individuals with control over their most personal information, yet promotes the efficient exchange of health data for the purposes of treatment, payment, research and oversight. To ensure the accountability of entities and individuals with access to personal medical information, the legislation imposes stiff penalties for unauthorized disclosures. 
The Health Care PIN Act provides consumers with a strong, nationally uniform set of privacy protections. However, in areas of privacy law in which states have been the most active--namely in the confidentiality of sensitive mental health and public health records--states could continue to establish additional protections. 
I would also like to indicate my intent to work with Senator Jeffords to incorporate into this legislation protections against genetic discrimination in both employment and health insurance. Although we were unable to resolve this issue before introduction of this legislation, I am confident that we can reach consensus on this critical and timely issue. 
This legislation represents common-sense middle ground in the range of proposals that have been offered both this and the previous Congress. I look forward to working with Senator Jeffords, as well as with Senators Bennett, Leahy, and Kennedy, who have contributed so much to this debate, to move forward quickly to enact comprehensive, bipartisan legislation.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I rise to express my opposition to Senator Kyl's sense of the Senate Amendment to the Budget Resolution. While this amendment raises important concerns about the scope of seniors' choices in determining their personal health care needs, this proposal may actually restrict the health care options available to our nation's senior citizens and undermine the quality of care afforded all Medicare beneficiaries. 
Initially, Senator Kyl's amendment simply seems to endorse the important role of choice for seniors when making critical decisions about their personal health. I strongly support efforts to increase the health care options available to Medicare beneficiaries and improve the quality of health care that seniors receive. However, this amendment would move us in the wrong direction. With approximately 96 percent of physicians treating Medicare patients presently, choice of physicians does not appear to be a problem for Medicare beneficiaries. In reality, Medicare allows seniors to choose the doctor of their choice along with providing protections that shield Medicare beneficiaries from unnecessarily high out-of-pocket costs. Ironically, in many ways, Senator Kyl's amendment is a problem in search of a solution. 
Senator Kyl's legislation specifically supports private contracting between physicians and patients for services traditionally covered by Medicare. By allowing doctor's to privately contract for these services, this amendment could effectively remove consumer protections designed to protect seniors' from excessive out-of-pocket costs. These protections are critically important to the elderly who rely on the affordable and high-quality care that Medicare provides. Private-contracting for Medicare-covered services would cause seniors to pay 100 percent of any given health care service or benefit. Few seniors can afford or have any desire to pay, such exorbitantly high-rates. It is also important to note that seniors' are perfectly free to contract privately with their doctor on health care benefits not covered by Medicare such as routine physical exams, eye care, and prescription drugs. However, by permitting doctors to charge their Medicare patients whatever they wish for Medicare-covered health care services, we would be subjecting seniors' to unnecessarily high-out of pocket costs and would compromise the quality of care afforded to all Medicare beneficiaries. 
I am also deeply concerned that this initiative would create a two-tiered health care system for the elderly, threatening the quality of care afforded all Medicare beneficiaries. Private contracting could create an incentive for wealthier and healthier beneficiaries to opt out of the Medicare program. This could lead to a health care system that provides high-quality coverage to those seniors' who could afford the high out-of-pocket costs associated with private-contracting, while leaving the majority of Medicare beneficiaries with substandard care. Almost 70 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have an annual income under $25,000. It is simply unconscionable for these seniors of modest means to be subject to paying 100 percent of their health care bill to services that are normally covered under the Medicare program. Additionally, the implementation of a private-contracting system would provide an incentive for doctor's to give priority to those Medicare beneficiaries who can afford to pay for it at the expense of providing quality and affordable care to the majority of Medicare beneficiaries. 
Additionally, the Kyl amendment would offer the potential for increased fraud and abuse within the Medicare program. The Medicare system is already fraught with staggering levels of fraud and abuse. According to the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, $23.2 billion annually is wasted on fraud and abuse in the Medicare program. Given the financial challenges that face the Medicare program in the near future, this level of abuse in unacceptable. Allowing physicians to set their own payment rates for certain patients, while simultaneously permitting them to submit claims to Medicare for the treatment of traditional Medicare beneficiaries for the very same procedures, would create the opportunity for double billing, a serious form of fraud and abuse. While we should be moving to prevent fraud and abuse in the Medicare system, private contracting would offer the potential for increased fraud in the Medicare system.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to applaud the Senator from Alabama for focusing attention on the important concerns of stay-at-home parents. I have said repeatedly, and continue to believe, that the best child care providers, particularly in the earliest months and years, are parents. Clearly, where both parents must work, we should try to help them provide the best possible care of their children. However, we should also help parents who make the difficult decision to forego a second income so that one parent can stay at home to care for a child. 
That is the reason why I introduced legislation, S. 1610, the Child Care ACCESS Act, that will, for the first time, extend the Dependent Care Tax Credit to parents who stay at home to care for their young children. In fact, this piece of legislation, co-sponsored by 26 of my Democratic colleagues, does more for stay-at-home parents than any other proposal that has been introduced. Only this legislation would extend this important financial assistance to stay-at-home parents earning less than $30,000. For such families, the financial sacrifice of forgoing a second income is severe. They certainly deserve as much, if not more, support in staying home to care for their children as families earning more than $30,000. 
Mr. President, if we are serious about helping parents who want to be home with their children, we should also promptly enact an expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. I have introduced legislation which would extend the benefits of the Family and Medical Leave Act to allow an additional 13 million parents to stay at home for up to 12 weeks to care for a newborn or sick child without fear of job loss. 
I think we would all agree that we must support all parents --mothers and fathers--in the decisions they make, whether it is to work in the paid labor force, to stay home with their children, or do some of each. Indeed, many parents move in and out of the labor force at different points in their children's lives--depending on the ages and needs of their children and their financial situations. All families deserve our help in raising the next generation of Americans. We must invest in our future if that future is to hold promise for our children, for our families, and for our country.

Mr. DODD. I have some comments to make on my own amendment, but several of my colleagues have other matters to attend to, and I will yield, if I may, whatever time she may consume to the distinguished colleague from California and then to my colleague from Minnesota. 
I yield first to my colleague from California.

Mr. DODD. I would say to our colleague from California I am aware of this figure. It is 200,000. The reason I know that number is because in 1996 I asked the General Accounting Office to do an assessment to determine the extent to which the child care needs of working families were being met, including whether there were waiting lists for child care. California was one of the States that was surveyed. The report found that California presently has some 200,000 families who are waiting for a quality, affordable, accessible child care slot to open up so they may leave their child in a safe place.

Mr. DODD. I thank our colleague from Washington as well. As I mentioned, her experience goes back to her years of public service and her years as a parent. 
I was looking at the clock as she spoke. It is almost 3 o'clock. This would not apply to all parts of the country, but certainly on the east coast right now there are as many as 5 million children who have no safe place to go after leaving school. We know that for parents who have no choice but to be in the workplace, when school lets out, and before they get home from work at 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock, there is a great sense of anxiety about where their child is? They worry: Who is watching my child? What is my child doing? 
We know from police chiefs all over the country, that juvenile delinquency rises, not after 11 p.m. at night, but between 3 o'clock and 8 o'clock in the evening. 
My hope is to raise some legislative ideas which would allow us to at least deal with after-school care, with infant care, with the quality of child care. But, I am being told by the budget resolution I cannot do that; I cannot bring up my idea on after-school care on child care in this Congress because it is subject to a point of order. I don't think it is fair. I don't think it is right. I think it is harmful to children and working families. 
My colleague from Massachusetts cares about this issue very, very much. I know he has some comments he would like to share as well.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. And I'd like to recognize him for his significant contribution to the issue of child care, particularly to early child development. We've all learned a great deal over the past year about brain development and the critical period in children's growth from the ages of zero to 3. My colleague from Massachusetts has been instrumental in focusing attention on the needs of children during the earliest years. I am particularly grateful that he is here today to comment on this amendment. 
I ask unanimous consent that Senators Murray, Kerry of Massachusetts, Daschle, Kennedy, Lautenberg, Landrieu, Durbin, Wellstone, Kohl and Harkin be listed as cosponsors of this amendment.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me take a few minutes and describe what we are trying to do. This amendment is a procedural one. I am not really debating the issue of how we should resolve the child care crisis--although there are certainly no shortage of opinions on how we ought to do that. All I am trying to do here with this amendment is to say, at some point later this year, if the funds are available, can I bring up a child care amendment without being subjected to a point of order? That is all I want to do. We can get to the merits of various child care proposals at some point later. But under this budget resolution, I am precluded from bringing up such proposals, unless I can override a point of order that requires a supermajority. I don't think that is right or fair. 
I don't disagree with those who might say we want to provide a tax cut as a result of having additional revenues, either because the economy is doing tremendously well or if we are able to come up with a tobacco settlement. But what I don't understand is, if it's OK to bring up those issues, why can't I bring up child care, which is a staggering problem? Five million children at this hour, as they finish school for the day, are home alone, unattended. Thirteen million children, every day need some kind of child care setting. And their parents need the ability to pay for that care. But, as you can see from this graph, due to inadequate funding, only 1 in 10 eligible children are receiving assistance from the Child Care and Development Block Grant. Many other families are left to cope with skyrocketing costs. As you can see from this second chart the cost of child care in various cities across America is truly astonishing. In Boston, child care for an infant is $11,860 a year. For a 3-year-old, it's $8,840. For 6-year-olds, it's $6,600. Costs of child care in other states--Florida, Minnesota, Texas, Colorado--range from $4,000 to $9,000. 
These figures are all the more astonishing when you realize that half of all the parents with young children earn less than $35,000. Can you imagine how difficult it must be for a family in the city of Boston that earns $35,000 a year to afford $11,000 in child care for an infant? Your family is making $35,000 a year and you may have to spend a third of your budget on child care. How do you make ends meet? 
I am not suggesting that the federal government should pick up the whole tab here. But I have some ideas about how we can leverage funds from states, from communities, and from businesses. But I can't even offer these ideas without overcoming a point of order. 
Whatever else you may agree or disagree with when it comes to child care, isn't it at least fundamentally fair on an issue this important that we be allowed in this body to debate our options? The budget resolution is about making decisions on how to spend the money of the American people. Now not all of my constituents may agree that child care is important, but a lot of people do. I am going to have to say to them: I am sorry, I can't even bring up your ideas about what we should do to make sure that your child has a safe place to be when you can't be with them. I am not allowed to raise your concerns under this budget resolution. We are allowed to have, on page 27 of this bill, title II, budgetary restraints and rulemaking, line 3, a tax cut reserve fund. That is allowed. So we are allowed to have a reserve fund for tax cuts, but we're not allowed to have a reserve fund for child care. 
All I want to do is to create a reserve fund to leave open the possibility of dealing with the issue of child care. Vote against me later if you want. Stand up and say you're sorry, but you don't like my ideas. I will accept it if you disagree with me. But, I can't imagine anybody here, regardless of ideology or party, would say I should not be allowed, in a budget resolution --to address a priority we all agree is pretty high on the list. I ask my colleagues here, 50 plus 1, to say we agree with you, we think that ought to be a priority and we are going to support you. As it 
stands right now, if it tries to raise concerns or offer solutions to this problem then I have to produce a supermajority to overcome a point of order--which everybody around here knows is virtually impossible to do. 
Mr. President, this is a very real issue, one that I think is important. I only have half an hour and to even debate this issue and to tell people why I feel so strongly about it. We have to move along. 
I will say from the outset that I have great respect for the chairman of the Budget committee. He has a thankless job, as does my colleague from New Jersey. It is difficult work. I sat on his committee for a number of years. I realize it is not easy to put a budget resolution together. But I believe I ought to have a chance--I believe I deserve a chance--to speak to the needs of children in this nation. There are millions of children, Mr. President--who don't have access to high quality care. Only 17 States have child care standards that meet even minimal standards of quality. In most States, if give manicures, if you work on someone's nails, you have to meet tough standards. But only 17 States require any training at all for somebody who is going to hold a child's life in their hands. Where is the logic in that? 
What I would like to see is debate on how we can improve the quality of child care, through training, and by improving provider-child ratios. I want to debate tax cuts to assist businesses that want to provide child care to their employees. I know my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, would like the chance to present this very good idea. 
There is something fundamentally wrong with a process that would preclude debate on those ideas. 
I see my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, is here. Let me, if I can, yield a few minutes to her. I turn to my colleague from Louisiana, who has worked for many years on children's issues in her state and has brought great energy to these matters since her arrival in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. 
Let me reiterate the point of this amendment. What this amendment would do is establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund, similar to the tax reserve fund created by the Chairman on page 27 of the resolution, to improve the availability, affordability, and quality of child care. A reserve fund--for those who may not be aware--is simply a mechanism that allows legislation, in this case child care legislation, to be offered later in the year without the threat of a budget point of order being brought against it. 
Why is that necessary? The budget resolution before us today forecloses the possibility of other meaningful and comprehensive solutions to child care. It does contain some proposals for child care, but it doesn't allow us to offer our alternatives for meeting the concerns of families in this country. 
Senator Murray, our colleague from Washington, offered an amendment as a member of the Budget Committee in the markup which would have kept our options open. That amendment and this one would allow the Senate to consider mandatory funding--just consider it, not require it--for child care. This amendment was rejected by the committee along party lines. So, as the budget resolution now stands, future legislative attempts to improve the quality of child care, or to help families afford the skyrocketing costs of care, or to create after-school programs for the 5 million children home alone each day after school, to provide for care for children with special health needs, are all shut out. I would like the opportunity to offer those ideas. To do so, this amendment must be adopted. If not, then I am foreclosed from doing so, and that is the reason I am asking for support.

Mr. DODD. To my good friend and colleague, who is so knowledgeable on these issues, let me state this as I understand it, and you respond, if you will. 
In order to do what you have suggested, of course, I would have to operate within the existing budget structure--which means I would have to take from one critical program--perhaps Head Start or education, to fund child care. I would have to make families compete against themselves. But if I want to take anticipated tobacco revenues or draw from the additional resources of a growing economy, as I understand it, I am precluded under this budget resolution from doing so. 
Out of that $300 billion or $500 billion in tobacco funds--whatever amount we ultimately decide here--I believe that $15 billion or $20 over 5 years can be found to commit to child care. 
But under this budget resolution, I would be subject to a point of order; is that not correct?

Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. I agree that we should not be creating programs that we can't pay for. That is the purpose of creating a deficit neutral reserve account. Like all reserve funds, including that of my friend and colleague from New Mexico, this reserve fund makes the hypothetical statement that if we somehow find additional revenues we should use them for the purpose stated in the fund. Being deficit neutral means that we would be required to find an offset. We don't know where the funds might come from, obviously. Around here, anything can happen between cup and lip. But we are working on an assumption that there will be some revenues available this year, and we want the opportunity to debate whether those funds can be used for child care. 
With regard to potential tobacco funds, the majority has made the decision that they must exclusively be used for Medicare. What some of us are saying here is that we don't disagree that certainly part of it ought to be for that purpose. But we think in addition to Medicare there are some other legitimate purposes, and one of them is child care. 
The fact is that the tobacco industry has, for generations, targeted children--and we all know that to be the case. Certainly their advertising, Joe Camel for example, has been designed to appeal to kids. Why? Because the industry knows that 90 percent of the adults who smoke began as teenagers. 
We are suggesting if you have some additional resources generated by tobacco company payments, shouldn't some of those funds be targeted to children and families? That is all we are suggesting. I am certainly not asking for the money to go exclusively to child care. I am not asking for a provision which says that money from tobacco can only be used for children. I wouldn't say that, because I respect the fact that there are other activities that need and deserve these dollars--public health programs, smoking cessation and biomedical research, and certainly Medicare. But I think that child care also has merit and that I ought to be allowed to make a case on why it deserves some of these tobacco dollars. 
Again, we may differ, as we certainly do, about how a child 
care bill ought to be framed. My colleague, for instance, from Vermont and my colleagues from Kansas, Pat Roberts, Senator Snowe from Maine, Senator Collins from Maine, Senator Specter of Pennsylvania and others--all have had ideas on child care which are ones they would like to have considered. So when I stand here to try to set up a reserve account, it isn't just to protect my proposals, it is to protect ideas they may have as well. But in the absence of the adoption of this amendment, whether it is my colleagues from the Republican side who care about child care, or colleagues from this side, unless we have the reserve account, we are precluded from doing anything meaningful in this area. 
I see my time has expired, the time of those who are the proponents of this amendment. I will yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. We anticipated that this might be one of the arguments that would be raised, and asked the Department of Health and Human Services to tell us exactly what the status of child care spending by the States is. I think this graph here states it well. My colleague from New Mexico just pointed out that 98.8 percent of child care funds have been obligated, but in addition, by January of this year 90.6 percent of funds had actually been spent. So the notion somehow that states are not spending the available child care money is not valid. I appreciate the Senator raising this point, but according to our latest data, the States have already spent pretty much 90 percent of available child care dollars. And they have obligated, of course, virtually 100 percent of it, which demonstrates, I think, a clear need out there.

Mr. DODD. Very quickly, first let me thank my colleague from New Mexico for his generosity in providing time here, on his time, to respond to his arguments. 
They still come back to the central point. We can debate all day the question of whether or not you think we are doing enough or not enough for child care. 
I tell you again that there are waiting lists in California of 200,000, Texas of 25,000, Florida 30,000--and in my State they don't even keep the waiting lists any longer. I say again that there are parents out there, as we sit here today, worried about where their children are. And the costs of child care, when it can be found, are staggering. 
Putting aside those issues--all I want to be able to do is at some point this year, before we adjourn, is to be able to offer child care legislation. I want to create a reserve account for children just like Senator Domenici has created for tax cuts. 
And I would like the chance to use some of the tobacco dollars, Mr. President. There may be as much as $600 billion in tobacco funds. But my good friend from New Mexico has said you cannot touch that money. That money is only going to be for Medicare. 
I do not disagree that Medicare is a priority. But if the tobacco companies for decades have targeted young people in my State of Connecticut and all across this country and 1,000 of the 3,000 children who every day start smoking will die prematurely, I think we ought to be able to take some of those moneys from tobacco and apply them to kids' needs in this country. I think most Medicare recipients would tell you they think their children and their grandchildren are important. You go ahead and ask any grandparent in this country whether or not they think every dollar we get from tobacco ought to go to Medicare. I think many of them will say that we should give something to our children--that they are also a priority. But unless I get this amendment adopted here, I am not going to be able to ask that question. 
I would like to have a debate about whether or not you think we do too much or too little in child care. But we are never going to get to that debate unless this amendment is adopted. 
This is not the time to debate child care, although I know I can make a case for the tremendous need that exists. The question my colleagues have to ask themselves is, should this body have the right to debate the issue of child care? Should we be allowed to go after some revenues that are coming in from the tobacco resources? Yes or no? 
If we adopt my amendment, you give me a chance to try. It does not guarantee me that I am going to get what I want. You may defeat me, but at least I get a chance to try. 
With that, let me yield a minute or two to my friend from Illinois.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Coats, in introducing the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998. 
The Higher Education Act is the foundation of opportunity and access to post-secondary education. Pell Grants, College Work Study, federal student loans and federal TRIO programs are what make college possible for the all Americans. The bill we introduce today makes important changes in these programs and updates and streamlines the law to ensure the vitality of federal aid programs in the next millennium. 
There are few pieces of legislation that we will consider this Congress that are as important to American families as this bill. Parents recognize that their child's success is in no small measure dependent on their educational achievement. Statistics bear this out--a person with a Bachelor's degree earns twice as much as one with just a high school education. 
But this issue is not only of concern to families; higher education has defined and shaped America's economy in the post World War II era. Our economy has grown on the strength of knowledge-based, highly-skilled industries and workers. This would not have been possible without higher education or without our federal commitment to ensuring access to college. 
Since the GI Bill, millions of Americans have been able to attend college because of the assistance offered by the Federal Government. Today, 75 percent of all student aid is federal. 
And yet, with rising college costs and growing student debt, families increasingly worry that college is slipping beyond their grasp. Studies suggest that, even with the nearly $35 billion of federal aid available each year, affordability is already becoming a factor for those at the lowest income levels. 
And in nearly all families, a letter offering financial aid is as, if not more, important than the actual letter accepting the student into a college of his or her choice. This bill works to make sure that the serious problem of rising college costs does not become more of a reality for America's families and reaches out to those who already believe that college is slipping beyond their reach. 
In particular, we have adopted many of the recommendations of the Cost of College Commission, formed by the Congress last year. We streamlined many regulatory requirements that may contribute to rising costs. We also adopted strong new disclosure requirements about cost. These provisions will provide families with new, reliable and comparable information on college costs, so they can exercise their power as consumers to choose institutions that are of high quality and reasonable cost. 
This legislation also strengthens federal financial aid programs which are a lifeline for 
millions of families as they struggle with cost increases. We authorize an increase in the maximum Pell Grant award and hope that appropriators and our Budget Resolution will follow through with adequate funds. We also adjust the treatment of the neediest students' earnings to ensure that they and their families are not penalized in the award of aid because the student works, as I recommended in earlier legislation. We also expand campus-based aid programs, like College Work Study and low-cost Perkins Loans, to reach more students. We improve the federal student loans programs by providing extended repayment for students with large balances and by giving colleges more tools to help their students avoid expensive loans. 
Students are also guaranteed a substantially lower student loan interest rate. As many members are aware, the issue of the student loan interest rate has been the most controversial and closely followed issue in this bill. I am very pleased that the solution we put forward today ensures that students will receive the long-term benefit of substantially lower rates. However, I am disappointed that this bill expects taxpayers to foot this bill with a new subsidy to banks. This new entitlement to banks is also costly and raises serious budget concerns on our bill. I am hopeful that we can continue to work on this issue with the majority, the Budget Committee and the Administration to reach a better solution for taxpayers than the one proposed today. 
This legislation also includes new authority for the Secretary to explore the potential of distance education and learning. In the past, distance education too often meant correspondence courses with little merit and high cost. Today, the Internet, the World Wide Web, and other emerging technologies offer new opportunities for quality, interactive learning right from a student's home. However, current law provides little opportunity for institutions and their students to explore these exciting opportunities. The bill we introduce today directs the Secretary to undertake and carefully monitor a demonstration program in distance education. 
The bill also includes another important initiative to increase access to post-secondary education--the Child Care Access Means Parents in School Act, which Senator Snowe and I introduced last year. This bill will support campus-based child care centers meeting the needs of low income students. As the non-traditional student population grows, one of the major obstacles facing students who are parents is locating affordable, quality child care. Campuses are a key place to meet this need. In my home state of Connecticut, all of our community-technical colleges have campus-based child care facilities. The centers provide student-parents with convenient, high quality care and also serve as laboratories for training new child care providers. 
Colleges are also our nation's laboratories for training teachers. This bill offers significant new support in this area. The committee has worked hard with its members and developed a comprehensive teacher training program that supports state-level initiatives and local partnerships. This two-track approach will ensure that colleges and schools who work together to improve teacher training will be rewarded at the state level with recognition for achieving higher standards. In another important initiative, this bill also offers teachers working in high poverty schools with loan forgiveness. This effort will provide highly qualified teachers with a powerful incentive to share their talents, skills and knowledge with the neediest children. 
Beyond bringing student aid programs in line with today's realities, we also take a key step to modernize and improve the delivery of these crucial student aid programs in the creation of the Performance-Based Organization within the Department of Education. the PBO will administer and deliver all federal student aid. At nearly $35 billion a year, the complexity of this undertaking demands talent, energy, experience, and performance. A PBO will ensure that the Secretary can recruit the best people to this job and retain them based on their performance. 
Mr. President, this is a strong and comprehensive bill. But perhaps most importantly for its future, it is a bipartisan bill. I was pleased to be a part of the effort of our chairman, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Coats in pulling this bill together. It may not be everything any one of us wanted; however, it is what America's students and their families need.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the best friends that Connecticut's farmers have ever known: Vincent R. Majchier of Franklin, Connecticut. 
Mr. Majchier held a number of important posts throughout his life. He was the Connecticut Executive Director of the Farm Service Agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture in Connecticut for a decade, as well as acting Agriculture Commissioner. 
Vinny Majchier was uniquely qualified to serve in these positions. He grew up on a farm near Franklin and worked the same land his entire life. He was known throughout the state as the farmer's farmer. Whenever a Connecticut farmer had a problem, they would go to Mr. Majchier and he would do everything in his power to help them. And no problem was too small. I can't remember how many times he came into my Connecticut office to speak on someone else's behalf. It didn't matter if someone's corn fields had flooded, a frost had ruined some crops, or a friend was having problems with the price of pumpkins. Their problem was his problem, and he would do whatever he could to lend a hand. 
Mr. Majchier also distinguished himself away from his farm and in the town of Franklin, where he lived his entire life. He served as Chairman of the Franklin Police Advisory Commission. He was a member of the Franklin Board of Selectmen, the Franklin Board of Assessors, the Franklin Board of Tax Review and on the Planning and Zoning board. 
He also served as a charter member of the Franklin Lions Club, a trustee of St. Francis of Assisi Church in Lebanon, and a member of the Auxiliary State Police. 
While he always had a new activity occupying his time, Vinny Majchier's first priority was always his family and his farm. These two true loves will both serve as his living legacy now that he has passed on. 
He was survived by his wife Pauline; his four sons; two sisters; and nine grandchildren. I offer my heartfelt condolences to them all.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the leader. Let me thank both leaders here. It is not an easy task to try to fashion these agreements. I sympathize in that we have spent I don't know how many days trying to work out an agreement to discuss amendments. In a sense, what the Democratic leader was trying to do was get the bill up and allow the amendment process to flow. I suspect this bill might have been dealt with after having been given a chance to raise these amendments earlier. 
It may seem like it is not that large an issue to people. It is one proposal. I suspect this may be one of the few opportunities when we will get a chance to debate education this year, given our calendar. I suggest to my colleagues, Mr. President, that we are talking about $1.6 billion that will go toward education in this case. I think having a healthy debate about where those resources go is something that the country would like to hear. Whether or not we want it to support building up the deteriorating schools that our colleague from Illinois, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, proposes, or deal with classroom size, which Senator Murray proposes, or whether or not we want to go into special education, these are legitimate issues about how you allocate scarce resources. 
I applaud the efforts of our leader and, hopefully, we can get some accommodation so we can have a good, healthy debate.

Mr. DODD. I will try to abbreviate my remarks in light of the fact this is going to be a truncated debate. 
Let me begin very briefly by saying we are back at this again year after year after year after year dealing with a fundamentally flawed procedure. It is so flawed in my view that Senator McCain and I tried last year to get rid of the current certification process and to try to encourage the administration to come up with some alternative mechanism by which we, as a body, in Congress could express our deep and legitimate concerns about the growing problem of drugs coming into our country, and their increased use throughout this country, without damaging the ability of the United States to obtain cooperation for other governments in combatting which is a transnational problem. 
I fundamentally believe that while the certification process might have had some utility when it was first enacted in 1986, it has long ceased to be helpful in encouraging other governments to work with us in combatting the production, transit and consumption of illegal drugs. For those of us who were in the Senate at that time, we remember well why we crafted the existing statute. It was intended to get the attention of the executive branch on this issue, because at that time they were doing very little to work with other governments to put together credible bilateral counternarcotics programs. 
The administration got the message, as have subsequent ones. Nevertheless, we continue to go through this process still. We find ourselves year in and year out coming back to this process again. Here we are again in a debate about whether or not we will cut off Mexico from getting IMF, World Bank, or Inter-America Development Bank assistance, which if we did would creating untold complications for us and for Mexico. Let's remember that Mexico is a close neighbor, one with which we share a 2000 mile border and a complex web of very important and complicated day to day relationships. Only one of these is the drug issue. It is a very serious issue, but only one of very many. 
I see my colleague from New Mexico on the floor, and my colleague from Texas, both of whom are more well aware that most of us as to exactly what the nature of our overall relations with Mexico. 
I hope, Mr. President--maybe in vain once again--to make a plea to our colleagues, as I did earlier today to representatives of the executive branch, to take some time this year, sit down with responsible people who care about this issue, and see if we cannot construct some better framework by which we can express our concerns about this issue. I want to ensure that we get the maximum cooperation with every major producer and transit country in this hemisphere and elsewhere around the world. But the current system of certification isn't doing that. 
My colleague from Georgia has heard me say many times that I believe he has proposed the framework of a very good idea with his suggestion that we form an alliance with other countries in order to tackle this problem. I think I am becoming a stronger supporter of the Coverdell idea than Senator Coverdell is himself at this point. 
I think we need to have a little more balanced perspective about what the U.S. part of the problem. United States consumers spend $55 billion annually on illegal drugs. Mr. President, $55 billion in drug revenues comes from American pockets. American monies are helping to bankroll the very Mexican corruption that my good friend and colleague from California is talking about. This isn't being funded by Mexican dollars; it is funded by U.S. dollars. We are 5 percent of the world's population, yet we consume over 50 percent of the illegal drugs in the world in this country. 
So when we debate this issue in the context of the annual certification process, we need to focus on ourselves as well as on the activities of producing and transit countries and money laundering countries. Yet somehow our culpability seems to get lost in the debate. It is time for us to take a good look in the mirror. If we as a nation didn't consume these illegal substances in such great quantities and at such enormous human and monetary cost, then it would not be as profitable a business as it has become. That is not to excuse our neighbors who also must bear responsibility for failing to maintain credible law enforcement institutions to cope with the supply side of the equation. 
We need to try to keep this in perspective. As angry as we get about what happens in nations and countries in Asia and Latin America, and especially with respect to our neighbors to the south, it would be healthy if we also would take some time to recognize that children in Chicago, or Hartford, or Atlanta, or Los Angeles are not consuming this illegal drugs solely because somebody in Mexico wants them to. It is also because we are not during enough here at home, to address some of the underlying reasons why these children are driven to use drugs. 
The idea that if we scream loud enough at these other countries, we are going to somehow solve the problem here at home without doing anything else ourselves, I don't believe is a foolhardy notion. We need to figure out a way in which to get far better cooperation with other nations in addressing the supply side of the equation while at the same time working here at home on demand. 
There are a lot of statistics, Mr. President, which the administration and others have put together here. General McCaffrey is not a lightweight or a weakling when it comes to being tough with other nations in insisting upon genuine cooperation. His appointment as the drug czar was overwhelmingly supported by those in this body. He has done an incredible job as the director of the office for national drug control policy. He believes that the Mexican government has been cooperating and he works at this everyday. If he thinks that Mexico should have been certified, and he did, than I have to agree with him. 
The decision that was made on certification was made in consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretaries of State and Defense, and the Director of the Office of National Drug Policy, General McCaffrey. All concurred--knowledgeable people who care deeply about this issue--and believe that to decertify Mexico would be a major, major mistake and cause us major, major problems. 
I believe that the President's decision was based on a realistic assessment of what Mexican authorities were capable of accomplishing last year and what, in fact, they did accomplish. Perfection? No. But there was real progress. They need to continue to move in the same direction this year. 
That assessment, I might point out, appropriately took into account the institutional constraints that faced Mexico--a great deal of poverty, budgetary constraints, a weak judiciary, and corruption, things that my colleague from California has identified. Mexico is a country that is struggling economically. 
I will outline quickly some of the major issues that were measured. 
Trustworthiness of law enforcement counterparts. We are all well aware that corruption is a serious problem in Mexico, generally within the law enforcement and the military. The Mexican government has confronted that problem head on. 
The Mexican authorities discovered in 1997 that the head of their anti-drug agency, General Jose Gutierrez Rebollo, was implicated in major narcotics-related corruption with Amado Carrillo Fuentes, one of Mexico's most significant drug traffickers. They moved quickly to arrest and prosecute him. 
They did so even though, at the time, this was a major embarrassment to the Zedillo government. 
Recognizing that the drug mafia had extensively penetrated its National Counternarcotics Institute--its primary drug enforcement agency, which General Rebollo headed, the Zedillo government totally dismantled that agency because they felt he wasn't the only problem, there were others. That was done over the last year and a half. That is an indication of progress. 
U.S. law enforcement agencies have helped Mexico to rebuild its drug enforcement apparatus. Progress against corruption is the most visible evidence that Mexico is serious about routing out corruption, as was the handling of the Rebollo matter. He was expeditiously tried, convicted and sentenced. 
Let me comment briefly on the story that ran in today's New York Times concerning certain allegations made by General Rebollo against other members of the Mexican military. First, I tell you, Mr. President, that there is nothing new in the story. General Rebollo made these same allegations during his trial in an effort to get off the hook. To say things self-serving is an understatement. 
I have to doubt that the timing of the selective leak of portions of a classified report is not coincidental. It was obviously intended to influence today's vote. 
The administration has stated for the record that available intelligence information does not support the Rebollo accusations. And I believe we should accept that assessment. 
With respect to the judiciary, Mr. President, the Zedillo government has instituted new procedures for the selection of judges. No longer can the Mexican supreme court arbitrarily appoint judges; judicial appointments are now made based upon examinations. Under new review procedures, three sitting judges have been removed from the bench to date. 
Leaving aside the Rebollo issue, there is other concrete evidence of the Zedillo government's commitment to addressing government corruption and cronyism. 
With respect to the judiciary, the Zedillo government has instituted new procedures for the selection of judges. No longer can the Mexican Supreme Court arbitrarily appoint judges, rather judicial appointments are now made based upon examinations. Under new review procedures, three sitting judges have been removed from the bench to date. 
Finally, some 777 Mexican Federal Police have been dismissed from their jobs because of drug-related or corruption charges. 
However, Mexico is not China where government officials rule by fiat. Rather, just as in the United States, Mexican law makes available grievance and other appeals procedures to dismissed government personnel. Because of these appeals, the government has been forced to reinstate some 268 of these individuals. 
And, despite what some of my colleagues would have you believe, not one of these individuals has been assigned to counter narcotics or other sensitive law enforcement duties. They've been given what we call here in the U.S. `desk jobs,' pending further action by Mexican authorities to seek to permanently dismiss them. 
All of this represents progress on the corruption front.  
EXTRADITION 
With respect to extradition, for the very first time the Mexican government has approved the extradition to the United States of five Mexican nationals--wanted in the U.S. on drug-related charges. As in the United States, these cases are subject to habeas review and are currently on appeal in Mexican courts. 
I would also remind my colleagues that Mexican authorities have sought to cooperate in other ways with the United States in this very sensitive area. They have availed themselves of various procedures at their disposal and have used other means of turning over fugitives to us, including deportation or expulsion, when that has been legally permissible under Mexican law. 
In fact, it was through the expulsion process that the United States obtained custody of a major drug figure, Juan Garcia Abrego--a leader in the Gulf Cartel and someone who had the dubious distinction of being on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. 
That is cooperation.

Mr. DODD. As you can see from the chart printed above, a number of major well known second-tier cartel figures, including Oscar Malherbe of the Gulf/Juarez Cartel, Adan Amerzcua of the Amezcua/Colina Cartel, and Manuel Bitar Tafich of the infamous Juarez cartel have also been arrested by Mexican authorities and their extraditions have been approved. 
In addition, if you look further down on the same chart, seven major traffickers, including Felix Gallardo of the Tijuana Cartel, are behind bars and serving sentences anywhere from nine to forty years. Moreover, thanks to joint operations between United States and Mexican authorities, there have been extensive indictments of key players in the Tijuana cartel. 
These events all represent significant advances in disrupting the major drug cartels. 
ISSUE 7--MONEY LAUNDERING 
In 1996, the Mexican Congress enacted new statutes criminalizing money laundering--heretofore, as in the case of many other countries, it was not a crime. The complicated regulations implementing that law were issued just last year. 
Currently, Mexican authorities have more than seventy cases under investigation based upon these money laundering statutes--sixteen of them, jointly with U.S. Treasury officials. 
Clearly that represents progress in the area of money laundering. 
ISSUE 8--CHEMICAL CONTROLS 
Last December, the Mexican Congress passed comprehensive legislation designed to regulate precursor and essential chemicals as well as equipment for making capsules and tablets. This law is very broad in scope, and once fully implemented should be very effective in monitoring and regulating important ingredients in the illegal drug trade. 
ISSUES 9 AND 10--OVERFLIGHT AND MARITIME COOPERATION AND ASSET FORFEITURE 
Overflight and maritime cooperation has steadily improved. Similarly the Mexican Congress is in the process of considering legislation to permit Mexican authorities to utilize asset seizures and forfeitures as tools in their prosecutions of drug criminals. 
Mr. President, this has been a somewhat lengthy and detailed accounting of what has happened with respect to U.S.-Mexican counter narcotics cooperation during the past year. I believe that it paints a clearer and more accurate picture of what has transpired with respect to Mexican counternarcotics cooperation. I believe that it demonstrates a clear pattern of genuine cooperation between our two governments. I would hope that my colleagues will ultimately come to the same judgement.

Mr. DODD. I thank the leader for yielding.

I do not believe I heard a proposal I had suggested on special education, which I might point out, by the way, the distinguished Senator from Mississippi cares deeply about. In fact, he and I worked years ago, I would say to the Democratic leader, on the Budget Committee on the issue. But I would like to be able to raise that issue, I say to the Democratic leader, so the $1.6 billion specified in the Coverdell bill goes towards special education. I think it is a very important issue. I hope, and I inquire of the distinguished Democratic leader as to whether or not those two proposals would, under the present agreement, be allowed to be raised?

We are nowhere near that presently. We are still quite short of that 40 percent commitment. I raise the question that if we have $1.6 billion would it be better allocated to help out families and communities with escalating special education costs?

Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me continue what our colleague from Massachusetts has been talking about. 
This issue is going to come up tomorrow and will be debated. There will be a cloture motion. There are two issues the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from North Dakota, who has joined us here on the floor, and I care about. The first is we would like the opportunity to be able to offer amendments to this bill. I gather there has been some agreement on a limited number of amendments. But we think, on something as important as education, this may be the only time this year that we get to talk about the educational needs of the 53 million children who attend our primary and secondary schools in this country. 
First of all, the issue is about choice and giving our colleagues the choice to consider an alternative or alternatives to Senator Coverdell's legislation. Secondly, we believe that the issue is how the American people decide how they want their tax dollars spent. 
Let me first, if I can, describe what the Coverdell amendment does. The Coverdell amendment is a tax expenditure of $1.6 billion over the next 10 years that would provide, according to the Joint Taxation Committee, a $1.6 billion tax break, providing $37 a year to the families of children who attend private schools and $7 a year to the children who attend public schools. 
Of the 53 million children who attend primary and secondary schools, 90 percent of those 53 million children attend public primary and secondary schools; 10 percent, 5.3 million, attend private schools. What Senator Coverdell's legislation does is take a $37 tax break and a $7 tax break, and gives it to the 5.3 million children who attend private schools and gives the $7 tax break to children attending public schools. Madam President, 52 percent of the tax break goes to the 10 percent of children who are in private schools. 
Please let me put that in context. I recently researched how much it costs to attend a private school in the Greater Washington area. On average, it is between $10,000 and $14,000 a year. Such a small tax break, Mr. President, would provide very little assistance to parents who choose these schools for their children. 
The point that I make is, if you are going to spend $1.6 billion, whether you are a conservative Republican or liberal Democrat, would it not be wiser for us to try to improve the deteriorating physical structures of public schools that are falling apart in this country? Would it not be better, perhaps, to take the $1.6 billion and have it go to special education? 
Mr. President, I don't know how many mayors, how many county boards of supervisors I have heard from who report to me that they are spending an exorbitant amount of money to provide the valuable needed services to children who have special needs? All of us would agree that these children often require and deserve a great deal of assistance, but local school districts and taxpayers are often in desperate need of some financial assistance in providing for the educational needs of children with disabilities. Is this not a priority? Do you perhaps think this priority more deserves our attention than a $37 tax break? 
How about providing 100,000 new teachers to shrink the size of classrooms across this country? Most everyone will tell you, if a teacher is teaching 25, 30, or 35 students, those students are not learning as well as they could. Again, most everyone agrees, if you can make classes smaller, you can greatly increase the learning potential of children. Is that not a higher priority than a $37 tax break to go to the top 70 percent of income earners in the country? Or a $7 tax break if your child attends a public school? $1.6 billion could, as I said, provide some real assistance in construction, special education, Head Start, or additional teachers. There are many other valuable ideas. I am not limiting it to these four. 
As I said earlier, we have come through an era where we often spent money on many different ideas. We cannot do that any longer. 
We must now be very selective when we spend federal tax dollars. It seems to me it would be a wiser investment of taxpayer money to do something about special ed, something about school construction, something about classroom size, and something about early childhood education. I don't know of anyone in this country, regardless of their personal ideology or political affiliation, who would tell you they think those four ideas are less important than a $37 or $7 tax break.

Mr. DODD. Madam President, I say to my colleague from Massachusetts, absolutely not. In fact, as the Senator knows, our distinguished colleague from Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, has offered legislation to try and do something that would allow for these schools to be repaired. The estimated cost of that, the estimated cost nationwide from Maine to California I think is $22 billion.

Mr. DODD. What we are talking about today, when we say we would like to take this $1.6 billion and maybe apply it to the programs I have mentioned, not to suggest we will pay for all of it, but if you have limited resources, it will at least provide meaningful resources to these communities. 
Senator Coverdell's legislation is a tax break that goes to individuals, and parents who send their children to private schools get the bulk of it. Remember, 7 percent of the families in this country send their children to private schools. Ten percent of the children--93 percent of the families send their kids to public schools. 
Has anyone asked the families of children attending public schools how they feel about subsidizing the children who go to private schools? With all due respect, those parents made a choice. I respect that choice, but I don't necessarily believe that we ought to subsidize it with $37 a year when that $1.6 billion might go to the very issue the Senator from Massachusetts raised.

Our colleague from Illinois Carol Moseley-Braun, our colleague from the State of Washington Patty Murray, Senator Boxer of California, among others, all tried, as members of that committee, to get some resources in order to help out in these areas. Not only did they lose providing some additional help for these areas, the Budget Committee cut $1.6 billion across the board in education.

Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from North Dakota. I think he said it very well. Of course, he brings some firsthand information to it, talking about his own daughter who is in the third grade and the size of her classroom. It provides a wonderful example of something we might do to help out our local school districts. 
Education is very expensive, and the bulk of it is paid for by local property taxes, sales taxes; in some States by a State income tax. It is expensive. We made a commitment here years ago that we would help out with special education; we said we would contribute as much as 40 percent of the expenses to educate a child that has special needs. We have never gotten above 8 percent--never above 8 percent. 
I have communities in my State of Connecticut that spend $100,000 on a child in a small town. Now, these towns surely want to help these children with disabilities, but it seems to me that is a national issue, giving children an opportunity to maximize their potential. We promised 40 percent; we have never provided more than 8. 
What if we gave $1.6 billion to the States across this country that are trying to provide the education for these special needs children? I assure you, people will say thank you. 
I don't think anyone would believe that a $37 tax break for children attending private schools and a $7 tax break for children attending public schools is of a higher priority than almost any other issue you can mention when it comes to the educational needs of America's children. On the close of the 20th century, when we are going to have to have the best prepared and the best educated generation we have ever produced to compete in the global resources with limited, scarce resources, we provide $1.6 billion tax cut that could be better applied to our Nation's schools. I don't think it is right, and I am hopeful the American people will be heard over the next 24 hours and say to their Members, `Don't vote for this. Don't vote for this. Use my money wisely and well.' 
Madam President, I thank our distinguished colleague from Alaska for yielding us some time to be heard on this issue.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, when my father served in the Senate, he felt that one of his most important responsibilities was recommending individuals to serve on the federal bench. He took great care in choosing the most qualified individuals to serve these lifelong appointments. His selections were a source of pride, but none greater than Judge T. Emmet Clarie. Judge Clarie was appointed to the federal bench in 1961, and he served our state and the country honorably for more than three decades as a U.S. District Judge. Sadly, Judge Clarie recently died at the age of 84. 
Upon his passing, Judge Clarie was praised by all those who knew him. One of his clerks referred to him as `a second father.' Another said that they `learned much more working for him than they ever did in law school.' A third called him `the best teacher of lawyering you could imagine.' 
This admiration was shared by his colleagues on the bench. He was described by his peers as `a judge's judge' and `a model and an inspiration to all his judicial colleagues.' 
Judge Clarie's career of public service extended far beyond the federal bench. He taught high school to help pay his way through law school. He served as chairman of the Killingly Board of Education from 1938 to 1961. He was a state legislator for six years. He also served as clerk of the Connecticut Senate, prosecutor of the Killingly Town Court, and Commissioner of State Liquor Control Commission. 
The Judge was a skilled legal thinker, and he presided over perhaps the most complex criminal case in Connecticut history: the armed robbery of a Wells Fargo truck by foreign nationalists. But he will always be remembered for his common sense, his no-nonsense style, his fundamental fairness, more than anything else. When presiding over the case that involved the theft of millions of dollars and terrorists who were trying to fund a revolution, Judge Clarie saw beyond the defendants' hype and insisted all the while that they would be tried as simple robbers. He said, `Common crimes do not become political crimes simply because the criminal is a would-be politician.' 
Judge Clarie may have sat on one of the highest courts in the land, but he never forgot his roots. He lived in eastern Connecticut for practically his entire life, and he commuted more than 100 miles round-trip every day from his farm home in Danielson to his courtroom in Hartford. The Judge said that he needed to return to the country to be `refreshed' every night. His roots helped shape his philosophy toward the law. He said: `If the law is to mean anything, it means that all people--little and big--must comply with it.' 
T. Emmet Clarie was a straightforward jurist who brought a tremendous sense of fairness and equity to the bench. He was also a caring and honorable man who dedicated his entire life to public service and went out of his way to help others. The State of Connecticut is better for his service, and all those who were fortunate to know this great man will miss him dearly.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great journalist, but more important, a good friend: Kenneth Eugene Grube of Groton, Connecticut. Sadly, Mr. Grube recently died at the age of 76. 
Ken Grube worked for 44 years as a newspaper editor and reporter, and he spent the last 25 years of his career in Southeastern Connecticut at The New London Day, where he was a managing editor and the long-time editorial page editor. 
While he was at The Day, he was renowned for his emphasis on local topics, but he earned a regional and national reputation for his work. He served as President of the New England Society of Newspaper Editors and the Connecticut Circuit of the Associated Press. He was also a longtime member of the National Conference of Editorial Writers, and he edited the group's quarterly publication and served on its Professional Standards Committee. 
In recognition of his outstanding career of newspaper achievement, he received the prestigious Yankee Quill Award from the New England Academy of Journalists. 
The strong reputation that Ken Grube earned was based not only his journalistic talent, but also on his good will and commitment to serving his community. 
In 1976, the New London County Bar Association gave him its award for outstanding public service. People don't necessarily think of journalists as public servants, but Mr. Grube showed an uncommon devotion to his community and he used his position to affect social change. 
During his 15 years as editorial page editor, he would consistently focus on a particular topic, often on behalf of the poor and less fortunate, writing editorial after editorial until he had achieved the ends that he thought were best for his community and its people. 
He also spent a great deal of his time away from the newspaper working with various organizations in the New London/Groton area. He was President of the Family Service Association of Southern New London County. He served on the board for Waterford Country School. And he helped found the local Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholarship Fund. 
He was also Chairman of the State Freedom of Information Commission, which is fitting because he was one of the leading journalists in the state who fought to pass a state law that would protect the availability of public information. 
But aside from his many accolades and accomplishments, Ken Grube will be remembered as a newspaper man with a huge heart who genuinely cared about his readers. Everyone in town knew him, and he could often be seen in the restaurants and pubs in town striking up conversation with whomever was around. For Mr. Grube, the most exciting stories didn't come from City Hall or the Capital, they came from Main Street. He believed that the primary role of any good reporter was to note the everyday events in people's lives, and he stayed true to this principle through his entire career. 
Ken Grube performed countless good deeds in order to lift up others, and for that, we thank him. He was also a kind man and a good friend, and for that, we will miss him. 
He is survived by four children and four grandchildren. I offer my heartfelt condolences to them all.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who, like me, called East Haddam, Connecticut home and who demonstrated a great passion and love for this little town along the Connecticut River: Raymond Schmitt, who recently died at his home in Florida. 
Raymond Schmitt was a successful businessman who owned several companies that manufactured components for the aircraft industry. He was very generous with his wealth, donating money to the school system, the local historical society and many other organizations. 
He will be best remembered for his association with a Victorian-era mill village in Connecticut known as Johnsonville. In 1965, he purchased the mill village and restored the old schoolhouse, general store, and carriage house. In the windows of the buildings, there were whimsical mechanized scenes that delighted all visitors. Johnsonville would open during Christmas and other special occasions, and thousands of people delighted in visiting the village. It became part of the holiday tradition for many Connecticut families. 
Johnsonville has been closed for almost a decade, but Mr. Schmitt would still open it for certain events such as a fund-raiser for music students at an area high school. 
Mr. Schmitt was known not only for his commitment to his community, but also to his ideas for making it better. In recent years, he came to believe that the town's selectman style of government, which has been in place since the town's inception, was too antiquated and in need of reform. As a result, he wrote his own town charter, which called for a 7-member town council and town government. 
His charter was never adopted. But no one doubted that Raymond Schmitt loved the town of East Haddam. And it is this passion for his hometown for which Raymond Schmitt should and will be remembered.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true champion of public education and the arts: June K. Goodman of Danbury, Connecticut. Sadly, Mrs. Goodman recently died at the age of 77. 
One of the greatest gifts that June Goodman's parents gave her was an appreciation and a passion for opera and the performing arts. Just as they also provided her with a sense of community and an unfailing commitment to helping others. She had many jobs, including teaching, but what set her apart from others was her volunteer work. 
She directed the Danbury Music Center for 20 years and helped found the Charles Ives Center for the Performing Arts in Danbury. She also served on the board for the National Theater of the Deaf in Chester. In Hartford, she was best known for her unpaid service as Chairwoman of the State Board of Education and the Commission on the Arts. During the 1970s and 1980s she would actually make the 100 mile round-trip to Hartford several times each week to serve in these posts. 
June Goodman attained a national reputation for her expertise and work in the arts. In fact, President Carter often called on her for her advice and ideas. But the focus of her work always shone brightest on her home town and the state. 
For more than 40 years, Mrs. Goodman was a close friend to the famed opera singer Marian Anderson, who also hailed from Danbury. In 1990, Mrs. Goodman established the Marian Anderson Award fund, which provides grant assistance for talented opera singers throughout the country. After her passing, Mrs. Goodman's family asked that donations be made to the Anderson Award fund. This fund will serve as living testament to both of their legacies. 
June Goodman was an extraordinary woman and a true treasure. She will be dearly missed. She is survived by her husband, William, her five children, her six grandchildren, her sister and her brother. I offer my heartfelt condolences to them all.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all let me thank my colleague from Massachusetts for joining me in speaking on this issue. With just a few hours remaining between now and Tuesday when this matter may be very well decided, the very questions he is raising may never have another opportunity to be aired and discussed--certainly not in this Congress and maybe not again for some time. So I thank him for providing a valuable opportunity to raise some tremendously important issues. 
My fervent hope is that people all across this country between now and Tuesday will listen to what is going on here and will raise their voices and address the American Congress. My hope is that they will say--this is my money you are talking about, this $1.6 billion over the next 10 years that you want to go for a tax break that gives only $7 to public school parents, and maybe $37 a year to private school parents. My hope is that they will tell us clearly that this is not exactly our nation's highest priority when it comes to the education of our children. That instead we should be talking about school construction, about the need for smaller class size, about the need for early childhood education, and the need for funding for special education. 
These next few days may be the only time for the remainder of this year that we are going to have to talk about the educational priorities of this country. So I am hopeful that the questions that the Senator from Massachusetts has raised will raise the temperature of this debate. I am hopeful that the nation will focus its attention on this issue. 
The education of our children is one subject matter that joins people all across the political spectrum--whether you are a conservative Republican, a liberal Democrat, or somewhere in between. Everyone in America understands that if you try to talk about making this Nation strong and vibrant in the 21st century and simultaneously fail to invest intelligently in the public educational needs of this Nation, you are engaging in hypocrisy. This Nation cannot be strong, cannot be vibrant, and cannot be a global competitor unless we are willing to make the commitment that 
the overwhelming majority of people in this country want to make to improve our schools and to give our children the opportunities they deserve. 
I want to remind people of the numbers--they aren't terribly complicated. There are 53 million children in school today in elementary and secondary schools--53 million. Forty-eight million of them go to public schools--48 million. Five million go to private schools. Yet, this bill that we are going to be asked to vote on come Tuesday provides the lion's share of the dollars--fifty-two percent of the money--to only 5 million children and their families. These families get $37, and the kids who go to public school and their families get $7. 
Do you think that taking $1.6 billion and providing people with a $7 tax break, or even a $37 tax break if your kid goes to a private school, is an intelligent investment of your money? Do you think it is the best investment given all the other needs we have--with schools falling apart in our inner cities, with special-education costs rising every year? It's not uncommon to spend $50,000 or $100,000 a year to meet the needs of one or two children who require special-education. Eighteen percent of the budget in my State for education goes to special education. Do you think that meeting these needs is a lessor priority? Do you think that reducing the average kindergarten class size from 32 kids is a lessor priority? If you do, then don't say anything over the next 72 hours, because that is what you are going to get. But if you have a sense of outrage, a sense of outrage about what you think is a misplaced priority, if you think that we ought to be doing a far better job than what this bill calls for, then we urge you to speak out.

Mr. DODD. The Senator from Massachusetts has said it very well. I couldn't agree with him more. The great irony, you know, is that most people do not follow the activities of the Senate budget committee. If you want your eyes to glaze over, try to follow a budget debate, whether you are talking about local, State, or national budgets. It can get pretty arcane--budget stories get buried away in the back of your local newspaper. But what the Senator from Massachusetts just told you is absolutely the truth. There was a budget agreement reached that will set the priorities for education for the coming months and years in this country. This agreement has just cut $1.6 billion out of priorities like Head Start, Title I, and Safe and Drug-Free Schools. This agreement failed to provide funding to reduce classroom size, to train teachers and to provide early education. All of these programs are being cut, and simultaneously we are being asked to provide an additional $1.6 billion in tax breaks--$7 to a public school family and $37 to a private school family--as if by doing so, we were making some great commitment to education. 
I have spoken to students from every single public high school in my State in the last 10 or 12 years, and I try to make it to my inner-city public high schools every year. I spoke at Manchester High School last week, the week before at Harding, a public high school in Bridgeport, CT. I try to listen to what is going on in these schools. I have some wonderful schools in my State that have tremendous resources and great commitment by the local communities to support them. I am very excited when I go and visit those schools. I just wish I could take people with me on these visits because, unfortunately, in this country the only time we hear about public schools is when something goes wrong--when a violent act occurs or something falls apart. It is the old adage that the only planes that the media reports about are the ones that don't fly. We rarely hear about the planes that fly. And every day in this country there are teachers and students and families that are doing a terrific job in providing for the educational needs of their families. 
But, I also have other schools that are not doing as well, that are suffering financially, that have encountered tremendous obstacles in trying to meet the special problems that large inner-city schools and rural schools can face. Clearly, there are needs in these schools. My concern here, as the Senator from Massachusetts has expressed, is that on Tuesday we are going to vote to limit debate, that we will not be allowed to bring up amendments that we think would offer some alternatives for meeting these needs and for creating real choices for families. 
The irony of this bill is it is called a choice bill, a bill to give people choices about education. I would like the choice to represent the millions of families who think maybe the special-education needs are larger than a $7 tax break. And I have a lot of mayors and a lot of taxpayers in my communities who watch their property taxes go up because of the cost of special-educational needs. Why not give me a chance to offer an amendment that would allow this body to vote on whether or not they think that priority is higher than a $7 tax break? 
How about early education needs? I would like the opportunity to offer an amendment on early childhood education. There are 13 million children every day in this country that are in child care settings. There are 5 million kids in this country who don't have anywhere to go after school. You tell me what you think is more important--that I try to do something for those 13 million kids who are in child care, much of it of appalling quality, or the 5 million children who are home alone or wandering around in malls getting involved in trouble after school? You tell me where you want your money to go--a $7 tax break or a $37 tax break if you are in a private school, or would you like to see me as your Senator put some resources into after-school care to get these kids off the street? 
We would like to offer an amendment on school construction to improve the quality of public schools. We have schools falling apart across this country, as the Senator from Massachusetts has pointed out. You tell me where you want your money to go--toward improving these facilities so these kids have a decent place to learn, or do you want a $7 tax break? I happen to believe most people in this country, if given the choice to be here to vote on Tuesday, would want their tax dollars to go for things like early childhood education, school construction, classroom size, and special education. 
They may differ on the priority they would give to those different issues, but I would be willing to wager that given the choice of voting for any one of those options over the choice of spending $1.6 billion over the next 10 years for a $7 tax break, they would say that those issues are higher priorities. 
So I am hopeful that over this weekend and on Monday, people across this country will be heard on this issue. After Tuesday it will be too late. We won't get the chance to bring up the issue of choice again. This may be the only significant debate we are able to have on the quality of education in this country. 
So the Senator from Massachusetts and I and others are taking to the floor here today to try to raise the level of awareness so that the public will know what is at stake. It is an important debate and one that should be aired fully and thoroughly. We ought to have the chance to bring up school construction, classroom size, early education, special education and other ideas. This procedural debate is over whether or not we are going to be allowed to even raise these issues, to even discuss them and ask our colleagues to vote for them. 
Whether or not you agree with each and every one of these other priorities, shouldn't I be allowed to raise the concerns of my constituents? Mr. President, when I traveled across my State a few weeks ago and met with all my mayors, 169 cities and towns, and traveled to various parts of my State and asked them to tell me what they thought the priorities should be in this coming session of Congress, almost without exception, special education was on the mind of every single mayor in every town. Shouldn't I have the opportunity to raise that issue? 
I have communities in my State, Mr. President, that are small communities that have small populations, and yet it is not uncommon for those people and those towns to spend $50,000 or $100,000 on the special-educational needs of a child or two children in that community. And we all understands the value of doing so. 
We made a commitment years ago that the Federal Government would meet at least 40 percent of the costs of special education. But we have never contributed more than 8 percent--we have never kept our promise. So, if you said to me, What do you think is more important, what do your constituents care more about, lowering their taxes and providing some help from the Federal Government to educate a child with special needs or giving a $7 or $37 tax break? I would have to say that a $7 or $37 tax break misses the mark. 
Proponents of this bill will argue that this bill will give families more choices, that it will give them the option to enroll their children in private schools. There are many fine private schools in this nation and they do provide an important choice for families. But, Mr. President, I recently took a look around the Washington, DC, area to try to determine what the cost of a private school was just in this city, northern Virginia, and Maryland. The average cost is somewhere between $10,000 and $17,000 a year. Does anyone honestly believe that a $37 tax break is going to make any difference to a family trying to make a choice whether or not to send its child to a private school or a public school--$37? 
I am not making up these numbers. These numbers come from the nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee that did an analysis of this bill. And the Joint Tax Committee said that the average benefit for private school families is only $37. Where is the logic in this? Where is the logic in this, with the limited resources we have? And our resources are limited. The days are far gone and over when we could just write checks and spend money without any consideration of the fiscal implications for our Nation. Limited dollars are all we have. So with these limited dollars, what do we do with them? Do we spend $1.6 billion to give a $7 or a $37 tax break? With $1.6 billion, I may not solve every one of the issues I raised here. School construction needs top $112 billion nationwide; finding 100,000 teachers to reduce class size is expensive; early education and afterschool care is expensive; special education is expensive. I am not suggesting that the $1.6 billion would in every way solve these four problems I have mentioned, but I would rather spend $1.6 billion on improving the school facilities where we send our kids, reducing class size so the kid can learn better, reducing taxpayer costs on special education, and providing early childhood and afterschool care for families, than spend it providing a $37 tax break for someone going to a private school or a $7 tax break for someone going to a public school. 
What am I missing? The math here just does not add up. We have limited resources, we have limited financial capacity, we all know this. We are being told that we have a staggering problem in the quality of school facilities. We have a significant problem in special education. We have a significant problem in early education and afterschool needs in this country. We have a significant problem in the size of classrooms. Everyone understands these are legitimate problems. 
So, do I take that $1.6 billion and try to do something about school construction, special ed, class size, and early education and afterschool care, among others? 
Mr. President, over the next few days there will be a lot of TV talk shows about other issues that seem to have captured the attention of the American public. It will be interesting to see, come Sunday, whether the national talk shows think that the quality of the education of our children is of interest to the public. Even if you disagree with me on where our educational priorities should be, I expect you would agree that this would be healthier debate to have on national TV shows--about what we ought to be doing with our tax dollars and educational system--than what I suspect will be the topic of some of the talk shows. 
But without debate and without the discussion, this notion of choice will be lost. I am not going to have the choice on Tuesday, as it stands right now, to offer any of the ideas that I have raised here today. I think I ought to have that right, as one Member of this body. I think my constituency in Connecticut cares, at the very least as much and I would argue significantly more, about special education, early education, school construction and class size as they do whether or not someone gets a $37 or a $7 tax break or a $7 tax break. I think they care about these issues. Even the ones who disagree with me, I wager, Mr. President, think I ought to have the right to raise them and ask the 99 other Members of this body whether or not they want to vote for these ideas or against them. 
But as it stands right now, I am going to be denied that opportunity. That may be the only opportunity this year to raise these issues in a meaningful debate. We spent 5 days here discussing whether or not we should to name the national airport for Ronald Reagan. I voted for this proposal. But to spend five days--five days--on whether or not to rename an airport and then to be told I cannot get an hour on an education bill to talk about school construction. I do not get 5 minutes to talk about early education and afterschool care. I don't get 5 minutes to talk about special education. But I get 5 days to talk about whether or not we rename an airport. You tell me what the priorities are around here. 
If you wonder why I am frustrated and sound a little angry, it is because I am, because I hear people all across this country saying education is key to our nation's future. This country cannot meet its obligations and the challenges in front of it unless our young people get a proper education. And 53 million of them are sitting today in a classroom studying and trying to learn, with teachers who are trying to help them, and parents who are worried about them. I do not understand how we think we are going to convince them we are doing something worthwhile in giving a private-school child a $37 tax break and a public-school child a $7 tax break. That is what this debate comes down to. 
I plead with the public, please let your Members know that at the very least you think these ideas ought to be raised for debate and discussion and we ought to have the right to decide in a democratic fashion whether or not their votes, representing your ideas, are going to be cast in favor of a tax break for a few or trying to do something with that $1.6 billion that could affect the quality of public education in this country for years to come. 
I urge you over this weekend, and I urge the media, to spend at least as much time between now and Monday venting this issue as we have on an issue that, frankly, has very little to do with the quality of life in this country. We need that kind of debate. We need the opportunity to cast some votes that offer real choices--real choices--about the educational priorities of this country.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on a happier note, I was up until about 12:30 this morning, along with some other people from the Nutmeg State. It was not Minnesota that we were facing on a wooden floor in Greensboro, NC, but it was a dogfight--Huskies versus 
Huskies, the University of Washington versus the University of Connecticut basketball team. I know none of these young people I see here today were up that late. They were studying very hard, if they were up that late. 
The March Madness that we talked about last night watched Richard Hamilton, with zero time left on the clock, fade back and, over the outstretched arms of a 7-foot center from the University of Washington, hit a shot that was nothing but net. 
I know I speak for all 3.5 million people in Connecticut when I say we are proud of our Connecticut Huskies and the job they did. If Senator Helms and Senator Faircloth, my colleagues from North Carolina, were here, I would challenge them, because on Saturday we are going to beat that No. 1 team and go to the Final Four in San Antonio, TX. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier last week I had the privilege of having a brief conversation with His Eminence Bernard Cardinal Law, the Archbishop of Boston. In fact, it is a nice coincidence that my colleague from Missouri is here on the floor as I say these remarks, because I shared with him a message that Cardinal Law had sent to our colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, who had the privilege of knowing Cardinal Law when he was presiding as a bishop in Missouri back before assuming his present post. And he extended his best wishes to our colleague from Missouri. So I appreciate his presence here on the floor as I share these remarks. 
In the course of our conversation, Cardinal Law mentioned to me he was going to be speaking at a conference sponsored by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. The topic of the conference was to be on Cuba, Mr. President. 
The cardinal was very kind enough to send a copy of his remarks to me. And after reading them, I have no doubt that all of my colleagues should have that opportunity as well. They are excellent, excellent remarks and ones that I think will be worthwhile. 
I know Members are going through their own private discussions of what should be our policy with regard to Cuba. There have been some changes here. How do you respond to them? Cardinal Law has laid out, I think, some very, very creative, clear, and interesting ideas on how we ought to move forward here. So I urge my colleagues to read these remarks. 
Cardinal Law is extremely well informed on this subject. He has visited Cuba over the years. He has kept in very close contact with the clergy in Cuba. I was particularly struck, Mr. President, by what he believes we should have learned from Pope John Paul II's January visit to Havana; namely--and I quote him --  
The Holy Father has amply demonstrated that a policy of positive engagement can achieve far more change within Cuba than can the [U.S.] embargo. 
Cardinal Law starkly and very vividly highlights what he thinks is the failure of our current policy with regard to Cuba by contrasting it with our policies towards the People's Republic of China and even Vietnam--two nations that have had deplorable human rights records and where religious freedom is severely restrained, even as we speak here today. 
He then pointedly asked--and I quote him-- 
If openness is thought to be further freedom in those nations where change is not so evident, how it is that a different standard is applied to Cuba where there is evident change?

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would also like to call to the attention of my colleagues some very specific recommendations Cardinal Law has made to President Clinton and the administration, recommendations which the President has the authority, without any acts of Congress, to undertake. And I recite them very briefly to you here: Restore direct flights to Cuba; ease restrictions on remittances and travel; suspend implementation of title III indefinitely; and utilize current executive authority to grant general licenses to permit the sale of food and medicines. I say `title III.' That is of the Helms-Burton legislation. 
Mr. President, I strongly support these recommendations and hope that the President will immediately act on them. 
Let me summarize briefly some of the other major points made in the course of Cardinal Law's presentation. 
On the positive side, the Cardinal noted that `change has already come' to Cuba in many ways; `dramatic change has occurred within the last twelve months in the area of religious freedom'--I am quoting him from his remarks--`a principle of public, organized social service by the Catholic Church has been reorganized' by Cuban authorities; `the backlog of visa requests by foreign clergy, religious and other Church workers has been broken as the number of visas has dramatically increased;' and, `there has been the release [in the last few weeks] of more than 400 [political] prisoners [in Cuba].' 
The cardinal also readily acknowledges that Cuba's human rights record--and I agree with him--has been dismal. No one is suggesting, I hope--not by my remarks--that there has been a total transformation in Cuba. There has not been a total transformation, but there has been change, and it is significant, and we ought to respond to those changes that have occurred. 
He reminded--Cardinal Law did--listeners of Pope John Paul's party comments as he left Havana to return to the Vatican. I quote him. He said: 
The Cuban people cannot be denied the contacts with other peoples necessary for economic, social, and cultural development, especially when the imposed isolation strikes the population indiscriminately. 
Mr. President, I think it is fair to say Cardinal Law was extremely critical of current U.S. policy. He noted that the `[c]urrent U.S. policy towards Cuba was set during the missile crisis' and that `[a] policy driven by events of an earlier time does not meet the challenge of new possibilities which the Holy Father's visit opens up.' 
Finally, Cardinal Law made a number of very important recommendations concerning how we might begin to fashion some new and constructive policy initiatives. He recommended, for example, that steps be taken to isolate U.S.-Cuba policy from partisan politics by establishing a bipartisan national commission on U.S.-Cuban relations. I think this is an intriguing idea and one that I intend to discuss personally with the President and the Secretary of State. 
Mr. President, I believe that the cardinal's remarks are timely, they are important, and they are worthy of our serious consideration. I urge my colleagues to review them personally in these coming days as they formulate their own views on how we ought to proceed with regard to U.S.-Cuban relations.

Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Delaware for yielding. 
While we are on this resolution introduced by Senator Nickles and I and the distinguished Senator from Delaware, my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, and others, let me commend the Senator for the very fine way in which he is managing the effort dealing with NATO expansion. I know in a sense we are interrupting that debate to consider this resolution. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased to be a principal sponsor, along with our colleague from Oklahoma and others, of this resolution. I think it is appropriate, in light of events we have all seen in our newspapers and television stations, events that have occurred in Kosovo in the last couple of weeks, to speak, to be heard. I think it is appropriate. 
In this body we are oftentimes asked, what do these resolutions mean? What value do they have? People write resolutions with a lot of language, and here are calling for sanctions or expressing outrage over behavior, and it seems just like a lot of words. 
I remember, Mr. President, very vividly one of my first days in the Congress of the United States and I had a chance to meet with some refuseniks from the Soviet Union. They were courageously trying to achieve religious freedom for themselves and democracy in the Soviet Union, a very repressive regime. I remember raising the question to a couple of these people, does this have any real value when we speak out with resolutions, and people were wearing bracelets and so forth with the names of refuseniks. 
And there were those who questioned the wisdom of it, `Wasn't it more sort of a lot of rhetoric without having much influence?' I will never forget the response of these people. They said, `You have no idea how closely the world watches what you say in America. When you speak our names on the floor of the U.S. Senate, when you talk about us, you give us hope beyond belief. We live, we exist.' 
People try to suppress the rights of others or, worse, try to suppress the rights of others by engaging in the worst kinds of atrocities, as we have seen in Bosnia and now Kosovo. They need to know there are people who understand what is happening to them. 
So it is entirely appropriate and proper, Mr. President, that we take out an hour today. There may not be many who come here to address this issue, but I am very confident that there will be unanimous support for this resolution. There will be a vote on it in which we will be heard expressing, I think, the outrage of our constituents across this country, regardless of where we live, letting those who are suffering know that their voices are being heard, letting those who perpetrate this violence and outrage know that we know what is going on and we will not forget it. 
So to those who raise the issue of whether or not these resolutions have value, I believe they do. It doesn't mean that we are going to solve the problem today or that we are going to necessarily change events dramatically. But we just might save a life or two because of what we say or do here today--maybe more than that. For those reasons, I think it's appropriate and proper that we engage in a discussion of what has happened in Kosovo and to express our concern and outrage about it. 
It is a coincidence, in a way, Mr. President, that brings us to this. Unbeknownst to me, my friend and colleague from Oklahoma was working on a resolution just as we were--separately from each other. Last week, I came to the floor with the idea that I might offer such a resolution, and I was told that Senator Nickles, the colleague of the Presiding Officer, had a similar resolution he was working on. Rather than having two resolutions or trying to sort of paste a resolution together that afternoon, we worked together over the last several days and came up with this resolution that we have both sponsored and endorsed. We will be asking all of our colleagues to support this. 
I thank Senator Nickles and his staff for their cooperation in working out the language that we think will engender the broad-based support of our colleagues. I know all of my colleagues read the same reports that I have, Senator Biden has, and others have, detailing the very gross violations that have been perpetrated by the Serbian police and paramilitary units against the people of the Province of Kosovo, particularly the ethnic Albanian community, the overwhelming majority of whom are Muslims. The Albanian community makes up 90 percent of the province's population. More than 80 individuals that we know about have lost their lives in recent days, many of whom are women and children. Others have lost their homes and have been forced to flee from their villages in search of refuge. 
Yugoslav President Milosevic, whom my colleague from Delaware has very appropriately and properly identified as a thug, appears to be at the center, once again, of this current tragic situation. Sometimes, Mr. President, we don't know who is responsible for these events. We are outraged by them, but it's difficult to identify those responsible. 
I remember for years attending ceremonies to recognize the cream of the young Polish officer corps that had been summarily executed in the forests of Poland back during World War II. There were allegations back and forth as to who had committed the crimes, the Soviets or the Nazis. That issue was never resolved completely in the minds of people until Mikhail Gorbachev opened up the files and we discovered what many felt was the case--that the Soviets in fact had been responsible for that atrocity. But for years the debate raged as to who was responsible. 
On this issue, Mr. President, there is no debate. We know directly who is responsible, who has ordered this, who has tolerated it and who, in fact, supported and encouraged it, in my view. That is President Milosevic. The world needs to know that so that his name will ring in the ears of coming generations as somebody who allowed this, permitted it, encouraged it, and supported it happening in his country. Once again, the forces under his control are murdering and intimidating ethnic communities in the former Yugoslavia. 
As I said a moment ago, the majority are largely of the Muslim faith. It was reprehensible that Serbian police were in such a hurry to cover up the evidence of their heinous act and surreptitiously burying the dead without according them the proper burial services. Grief-stricken families bravely defied Serbian authorities and dug up their own dead--family members, their own children, wives, sisters--so that these people could be given an appropriate burial service, having been murdered by these police, in keeping with the Muslim religious beliefs and practices for the bodies to be facing to the east. It is 
imperative that the international human rights observers, members of the Red Cross, and independent journalists be granted access to communities in Kosovo to independently investigate these recent killings. All relevant evidence should be referred to the International War Crimes Tribunal for further investigation and prosecution as expeditiously as possible. 
It seems to me, Mr. President, and to those of us who sponsored this resolution, that it would be wrong for the United States to remain silent in the face of such despicable acts; hence, this resolution today. If we were to do so, we would simply, in our view, be encouraging Milosevic and his like to act even more viciously and recklessly than they have in the past, if that were possible, to repress the democratic aspirations of the people of Kosovo. We would also be running the risk that the current conflict would spill over into other countries and pose serious threats to regional peace and security. That must not happen. 
Silence, in a sense, is almost the coconspirator of those who perpetrated these crimes. So by raising our voices here and hopefully expressing our unanimous outrage at what is occurring, we do not become the coconspirators, if you will, of these atrocities. Fortunately, President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright focused very quickly on this matter. In the context of the so-called `contact group' established to monitor the situation in the former Yugoslavia, the United States has sought to galvanize the international community and to speak with one voice on this problem and to agree upon a course of action against the Milosevic regime should it continue its aggression in Kosovo. Today, the Senate will endorse those efforts, and the contact group specifically, by strongly supporting the pending resolution. Moreover, we would be adding our voice to those who call for the international community as a whole to come together behind the initiatives of the contact group. If the international community is prepared to do that, it will improve the prospects for a political solution to this conflict before it grows even more unmanageable. 
Mr. President, our colleague from Delaware started to read some of the operative paragraphs in the resolve clause of this resolution. I won't go through and read it all. It is in the Record. It does call for a freezing of government funds of Yugoslavia if we don't get compliance by March 25, over the next 5 or 6 days, with the terms set forth by the contact group. It also calls for extremely strong monitoring efforts by the appropriate international groups. 
This is not the end of this issue. If we don't see the proper responses in the coming days, as I said a moment ago, those of us who have seen and watched the terrible tragedies that have transpired here want our voices to be heard. We want those in this country who have family members there to know that we care deeply about this. We want those who may hear our voices in the Albanian minority in Kosovo to know that there are voices here--people whose names they may not know, faces they may not recognize, people they may never meet, but who will not be silent in the face of their tragedy. 
So, Mr. President, I urge colleagues here to, in a strong bipartisan fashion, support this resolution introduced by Senator Nickles, myself, and others, so that this body, this U.S. Senate will, on this day in March, express to the people of the world, particularly the people of Yugoslavia and Kosovo, that we hear their cries and we will do everything in our power to try to see to it that this tragedy comes to an end. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this resolution.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a critical measure that has the potential to save many lives--`Matthew's Law.' This bill is named after a very lucky third-grader from Bridgeport, Connecticut, whose life was endangered by the failure of his pharmacy to notify his family that an unsafe medical device had been pulled from the market. 
It is both unfortunate and remarkable that no Federal legislation currently exists that requires notification of consumers when unsafe drugs or devices are recalled. State laws also fail to guarantee consumers the right to know of recalls. Although 18 States recommend that pharmacists notify their patients of recalls, as part of professional standards of care, only one State (Vermont) explicitly requires that patients be contacted. 
This bill will amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to impose the commonsense requirement that when pharmacies are notified of a class I or II recall of a drug or device dispensed by prescription, they must notify their patients that the product has been pulled from the market. 
Class I recalls include those drugs and devices that could reasonably cause serious adverse effects on health or death. Class II recalls include drugs and devices that may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse effects on health. 
For over the counter drugs and devices, the bill requires that a notice regarding the recall be displayed in the pharmacy. Pharmacies that fail to comply will be subjected to fines of up to $10,000. 
Matthew McGarry, for whom this bill is named, has a life-threatening allergy to peanuts. In case he should accidentally eat one, he carries a device with him that injects a drug to counteract an allergic reaction, called an `EPI-E-Z' pen. 
When it was found that a few of the devices in one batch were leaking the life saving drug, all pharmacies were notified that the product was being recalled. And almost all pharmacies, acting in the best interest of their patients, in turn notified consumers. The McGarry's pharmacy, however, did not contact its patients. 
Thanks to the vigilance of his school's nurse, Betty Patterson, Matthew escaped unharmed--the defective device was replaced. 
Under current law, consumers have the right to be notified their automobiles are defective or when the toys that their children play with are found to be unsafe. It is only logical that we should have the same peace of mind when it comes to products like drugs and medical devices that directly affect our health. 
Most pharmacists do the right thing. Most pharmacists contact their customers when a drug or device is recalled. However, it takes just one incident, like that experienced by the McGarry family, to point out a dangerous loophole in the law. 
With Matthew's law, we will close that loophole and protect all American families from the McGarry's frightening experience.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for S. 1722, `The Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998.' I commend Senator Frist for his introduction of this legislation and am pleased to join him as a co-sponsor. 
Women's health programs administered by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention play a critical role in ensuring that the extraordinary scientific advances of our nation don't sit on the shelf, but are actually used to improve lives. 
The last few years have brought astonishing new developments in women's health research. Medical researchers have now located the genetic mutations that predispose women to certain types of breast cancer--knowledge that may lead to more effective treatment of this devastating disease. And through the CDC, a recent initiative focused on the prevention and early detection of breast and cervical cancer is already saving lives. In just the year since this program was begun in Connecticut, over 19,000 women received free screening for breast cancer--and 15 cases were caught early while they were still treatable. Over 1,000 women were checked for cervical cancer--and 8 cases were detected. 
We've taken a number of important steps toward improving women's health, but we must continue to support and sustain these programs if we are to truly reap the benefits of our initial investments. This bill clearly is a good start. 
I am concerned that some critical areas of women's health have been omitted from the bill. We would be remiss if issues so important to women's health, such as sexually transmitted diseases and reproductive health were neglected. However, I know that Senator Frist has indicated his willingness to continue the dialogue and to work with members of the Labor Committee to include these programs prior to markup. 
This legislation is the continuation of a commitment that we have made to women and our nation and makes a sound and intelligent investment in the long term health of this country. I again offer my support and urge swift consideration of this bill.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today along with my friend and colleague Senator Abraham to speak to this amendment that will help save lives and prevent injuries to our youngest children by improving education and awareness about child safety seats. 
Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death to children ages 14 and under. Yet some 40 percent of kids are still riding unrestrained. And of the children who are buckled up, studies estimate that eight out of ten are restrained incorrectly. Each year more than 1,400 children die in automobile accidents, and an additional 280,000 are injured. Tragically, most of these injuries could have been prevented. 
The most proven way to protect our children is child safety seats. They reduce the risk of death by 69 percent for infants and 47 percent for toddlers. We must work to ensure that they are used at all times and used correctly. 
This amendment that we introduce today will provide $7.5 million to the Department of Transportation for the purpose of awarding grants to state highway agencies, as well as child safety organizations who promote important information on the use of child safety seats. The legislation will ultimately allow funds to be used to help parents become better informed on the best way to restrain and protect their children. This money may also enhance public education on car safety through workshops, publications, and audio-visual aides. 
This past June, Senator Abraham and I sponsored a resolution that allowed the National SAFE KIDS Campaign to use a small portion of the Capitol Hill grounds to conduct a car seat check-up event and launch a new national safety campaign. The initiative, SAFE KIDS BUCKLE-UP, was a joint project of the National SAFE KIDS Campaign and the General Motors Corporation. Its purpose was to educate families about the importance of buckling up on every ride. This event and this initiative have been a success, but we need to do more to educate parents and public safety officials, not only on Capitol Hill, but in our communities. 
This legislation will put more resources at the disposal of the people in our towns and cities, so they may do a better job of educating others and raising awareness on this issue. 
Protecting our children is a critical national priority that deserves national attention. I applaud Senator Abraham for his work on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is poised to pass Examination Parity and Year 2000 Readiness For Financial Institutions Act, which I introduced with Senator Bennett last week. The legislation will provide badly needed authority and guidance to Federal financial regulators to help their supervised institutions cope with the Year 2000 computer problem. 
The Year 2000--or Y2K--computer problem is caused by the inability of most of the major financial systems to process the year 2000 as the one that follows the year 1999. This is caused by the fact that basic computer code, much of it written as many as thirty years ago, reads dates as two-digits, `98' or `99,' instead of four digits `1999' or `2000.' If left untreated, computers will read the year 2000 as the years 1900, 1980 or some other default date. The result is not only erroneous calculations, but the total disruption of many critical financial systems. 
Unfortunately, neither the Office of Thrift Supervision or the National Credit Union Administration have the authority to examine the Year 2000 preparations of service providers to thrifts and credit unions. Currently, other federal financial regulators--the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation--have this authority. 
These service providers perform many of the key transaction and data processing for federally-insured thrifts and credit unions, particularly smaller institutions for whom it is not cost-effective to establish their own computer systems. As a result, it is imperative to the safety and soundness of these institutions for the regulators to be able to establish that their service providers will be Year 2000 compliant. 
The legislation also contains provisions that require all financial regulators to hold seminars to educate their respective supervised institutions and, to the maximum extent possible, provide model solutions for fixing the problem. The beneficial impact of such outreach and education efforts for federally-insured institutions is self-evident. 
Mr. President, as I've said many times before, the Year 2000 problem is one that we will have to confront in many more ways than this legislation. The extent of the problem goes well beyond the financial services industry to affect virtually every segment of our nation's economy. But this sensible bill is a good first step to ensuring that Federal financial regulators have the tools necessary to address the problem in their area of jurisdiction. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this sensible, bipartisan legislation.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Lieberman in introducing legislation to add up to 15 acres to the Weir Farm National Historic Site in Connecticut for the creation of a visitor center and art gallery. 
The new property is located in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Because the land is adjacent to undeveloped State and Town land, the non-profit Weir Farm Heritage Trust can ensure that the proposed visitor center and gallery will be in keeping with the pastoral theme of the historic site. 
Eight years ago, Congress established Weir Farm as Connecticut's first national park and the only National Park Service site in the country dedicated to the celebration of an American painter. The 62 acre historic site contains the home and studio of the founder of American impressionism, J. Alden Weir and this rich landscape is the inspiration for many of his paintings. 
Together, the National Park Service and the Weir Farm Heritage Trust seek to raise public awareness of the farm's historical and cultural significance and to preserve the farm's artistic tradition, while developing a world renown art collection and providing artist workshops. Through a Visiting Artists Program, several artists each year are invited to work within the surroundings of Weir Farm. 
More than eleven thousand people visited Weir Farm in 1996 and almost ten thousand came in 1997. The Park Service estimates that by the year 2010, the number of visitors could increase to between 25,000-40,000. It is for these reasons that the Weir Farm Heritage Trust would like to acquire this land and convert an existing building into a visitor center and art gallery and construct a modest 30-space parking area. Language in the bill stipulates that the National Park Service will enter into a binding agreement with appropriate town zoning commissions to manage the projected increase in bus traffic and develop parking, visitor and administrative facilities. 
In December, the Ridgefield, Connecticut Selectmen voted in favor of the land acquisition proposal. In November, the Ridgefield Planning and Zoning commission also voted in favor of the plan, after convening several public hearings on the matter. 
This proposal is important to the people of Connecticut and all those who wish to see a bit of artistic history preserved in its natural state. I urge my colleagues to support this land acquisition proposal as well.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday, March 3, was designated by the President as the day to pay public tribute to the 37th anniversary of the Peace Corps. Although the official anniversary technically occurred on Sunday, March 1, a day during the week for events to be sponsored in honor of the Peace Corps' anniversary proved to be more practical. 
It was nearly four decades ago that President Kennedy signed legislation into law to create the Peace Corps in 1961 and sent the first class of volunteers to Ghana. Since its founding, more than 150,000 Americans have served in the Peace Corps. 
The public recognition of the Peace Corps' anniversary has special significance for me personally, as I was fortunate enough to serve as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic some years ago. Like other Americans who have had the honor of serving as Peace Corps volunteers, my service in the Dominican Republic will remain one of the most important periods of my life. 
Currently there are 6,500 volunteers, serving in 84 countries around the globe. These people dedicate two years of their lives to addressing the critical development needs of impoverished communities. They help people gain access to clean water, grow more food, help prevent the spread of AIDS, teach English, math and science, aid entrepreneurs in the development of new business, and work with non-governmental organizations to protect the environment. 
The Peace Corps has been marked by much success thanks to current and returned Peace Corps volunteers. Based on the Peace Corps' high level of achievement since its creation, and taking into account the unmet needs of the developing world, I support the proposed increase in the Peace Corps Fiscal Year 1999 budget. 
The value of the Peace Corps is not limited solely to its overseas volunteer service. There is a `domestic dividend' as well--the experience and value that is brought back to the communities where volunteers return once their two year tour is over. Experience has shown that Returned Peace Corps volunteers participate in their communities across the nation more than most other Americans. 
This week, as the nation celebrates the 37th anniversary of the Peace Corps, more than 350,000 students in all 50 states will learn more about life in the developing world by talking with and listening to 5,000 current and returned volunteers, in person, via satellite and by phone. In my home state of Connecticut, one of six states and 23 cities that declared March 3 as Peace Corps Day, students in New London talked to current Peace Corps Volunteers in Panama and students at Balboa High School in Panama via a live CU-SeeMe video conference. With advancing technology, it is exciting to have students in the United States learn more about people in different corners of the world, without even leaving their classroom. 
Finally, I commend all of those volunteers, both past and present who have contributed to the success of the Peace Corps. Every anniversary is an important one. This one has been made special by being officially recognized as Peace Corps Day--something that will hopefully become an annual occurrence. It serves as an opportunity for Americans to learn about other cultures of the World and to pay tribute to the more than 150,000 Americans who have dedicated part of their lives to making this a better World to live in. I am confident that we in the Senate are proud of each and every one of them.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate an extraordinary life. We in the U.S. Senate have lost a former colleague and a leading light of the U.S. Senate--Abraham Ribicoff. 
Abe Ribicoff, Mr. President, was born and raised in New Britain, CT. He was the son of poor Polish immigrants. Yet this humble son of Connecticut rose to become one of our State's and our country's most distinguished public servants. He served in this body for 18 years--beginning in January of 1963 and retiring in 1981. 
One of the highest honors I have had in public life, Mr. President, was to succeed Abe Ribicoff in the U.S. Senate, and I take great pride in the fact that in 1981 Abe Ribicoff placed my name in nomination for this office. 
Abe Ribicoff believed fervently that the highest calling one can have in American life is public service. He obeyed that calling as few Americans ever have. He is the only person in our Nation's history to have served as a State legislator, a municipal judge, a U.S. Representative, a Governor, a Presidential Cabinet Secretary, and a U.S. Senator. 
But to appreciate Abe Ribicoff, it is important to understand that he did more than occupy an impressive collection of public offices. What distinguished Abe Ribicoff from his peers, from his predecessors, and from those who have come after him is not the number of offices he held, but the manner in which he held them. Abe Ribicoff brought to his life's work integrity, candor, high 
principle, an unshakeable faith in America's Government, and a deeply held belief in the goodness and decency of our people. 
Abe Ribicoff had the rarest and most important of all qualities we seek in public leaders--courage in the public arena. Time and again, in ways large and small, he demonstrated a commitment to principle even in the face of fierce opposition. He was willing to fight for what he believed to be right. And he fought hard, though always--always--in a decent and honorable manner. 
In Abe Ribicoff's politics, there was no place for meanness, no place for personal attacks. He understood the importance of public opinion, but he never relied on polls to shape his political decisions. He was guided not by emotion, not by numbers, but by judgment, by reason, and by principle. 
One of the defining moments in his public life took place in 1968 at the Democratic National Convention. Here was a man, Mr. President, a first-term Senator, not unaware that he was confronting the entire national leadership of his party, willing to take a stand and make a very, very public display and call for civility in our society. 
In doing so on that day, he appealed, in my view, to what is best about our Nation and ourselves--our capacity for tolerance and understanding; our belief that in a truly civilized society we live by the rule of law, not by the rule of force; that in fact it is right that makes might. 
In this moment, the world learned what we in Connecticut had long known, that Abe Ribicoff was a national gift. 
His entire career stood above all for the belief that America is a land of limitless opportunity and equal justice. 
He abhorred discrimination in all its forms, and he knew it in his own life. During his campaign for Governor in 1954, an ugly whispering campaign questioned whether Connecticut was ready for a Jewish Governor. Abe Ribicoff answered from the heart. In a famous address in Connecticut, Abe Ribicoff said:  
In this great country of ours, anybody, even a poor kid from immigrant parents in New Britain, could achieve any office he sought, or any position in private or public life, irrespective of race, color, creed, or religion. 
The voters of Connecticut, Mr. President, answered that they agreed with their Governor-elect. 
Even when he himself was not touched by the sting of discrimination, he acted to do what was right. In 1956, a young Senator from Massachusetts was mentioned as a possible Vice Presidential candidate. Ironically, many Catholics, mindful of the discrimination that still existed against them, questioned whether America was ready for an Irish Catholic in the White House after what had occurred to Alfred Smith in 1928. 
Abe Ribicoff, speaking to the Irish Catholic leadership of the Democratic Party, took exception. 
I never thought [he said] I'd see the day when a man of the Jewish faith had to plead before a group of Irish Catholics about allowing another Irish Catholic to be nominated for the position [of Vice President]. 
In no small measure, Mr. President, it was Abe Ribicoff's faith--faith in his country and faith in a candidate that propelled John Kennedy to the Presidency just a few years later. 
Once again, Mr. President, in 1976, questions were raised about whether a southern Governor and a born-again Baptist believer could serve as President of the United States. Without a moment's hesitation, this Connecticut Yankee said yes. Judge the man, judge his ideas, but do not judge his personal faith. 
Abe Ribicoff lived most of his professional life at the highest, most austere and auspicious levels. He knew his share of Governors, of Senators, of Presidents. But lest we forget, Mr. President, he also knew struggle. He knew hardship growing up among the shops and mills of New Britain, CT. And he knew discrimination and he knew defeat, having lost his first campaign in the Senate by a slim margin. 
But even as he rose to the very top of public life, he never forgot about those that he served. He knew that all principles are in the end empty letters and hollow rhetoric if they are not connected to people's lives. The instrument of Government, the laws of the land mean little if they do not help ordinary citizens surmount obstacles and obtain their noblest aspirations. 
At a time when Medicare was described as `socialism,' Abe Ribicoff knew that it embodied the obligation of a compassionate society to care for its elderly. When some called civil rights laws an affront to `States rights,' he knew that they could make the promise of equal justice a reality for millions of Americans. When others said that a Governor and a Senator should not spend his time fussing about highway safety, he knew that a tough approach to speeding and drunk driving would save lives and spare families immeasurable grief and sorrow. 
We have spoken of Abraham Ribicoff as a public servant, but he was much more than that. He was also a husband and a father. To his wife Casey and to his family we convey our deepest sorrow. 
He was also a teacher. I consider myself extremely--extremely--fortunate to have been able to call on him many, many, many times since he left office in 1981 for his advice and counsel and guidance and just good old political conversation. No one--no one--in this world of political life could have had a better mentor than I did in Abe Ribicoff. 
Mr. President, I want to close with a reading from Hebrew text. It captures, I believe, the essence of this man whose passing we all mourn today. Let me quote it: 
A good name is to be chosen above wealth, and character rather than silver and gold. 
Blessed is the one who bequeaths a good name to his descendants. 
There are three crowns: the crown of Torah, the crown of priesthood, and the crown of royalty, 
But the crown of a good name excels them all. 
Even a long life ends too soon, but a good name endures forever. 
Blessed is he whose noble deeds remain his memorial after his life on Earth is ended. 
Mr. President, I yield to my good friend and colleague, Senator Lieberman.

Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me commend our colleague from North Dakota for a very eloquent statement and the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle of South Dakota, for laying out one of the primary objectives of a Democratic agenda for this session of the 105th Congress. 
I think there are issues that ought to enjoy and attract strong bipartisan support--sustained growth in our economy, a balanced budget, a growing surplus, and investments in the educational and health needs of young people. I certainly hope that on managed care issues, in particular, we can find consensus--making sure that people across this country have the right to choose their own doctors and are not going to be forced out of the hospital prematurely. A bill of rights for patients is something that is long overdue. I know that the people of American are hoping that this Congress will address these issues before we adjourn. 
I want to commend those who are responsible for putting this agenda together and to address a few aspects of it more fully. 
Shortly we will be hearing from our colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, who has led a task force over the past several months to fashion a bill to deal with the difficult issue of tobacco use by young people--a bill which I was pleased to cosponsor. As Senator Dorgan just discussed, the facts on youth smoking are not in controversy--3,000 young people start smoking every day, and 1,000 of those will die prematurely. 
This is an issue that ought to unite Americans regardless of political persuasion or ideology. We all pay when children become addicted to tobacco. It is not just the children who pay with abbreviated lives that might have produced far more for themselves, for their families, and for their Nation. But all of us in a sense suffer when we, by our silence, by our inaction promote or at least don't try to retard the growth of a problem that so negatively affects young people. So, I am hopeful in these few legislative days we have remaining, we will do something meaningful to reduce the harmful impact of tobacco on the children in this country. 
We all know that a tax increase, which makes tobacco less affordable, is one of the ways to do that. I'd like to cite some facts from a recent survey done in my State--in Fairfield County, CT. This county is a one of great affluence--it contains the towns of Greenwich and Westport some of the more affluent communities in the Nation. It is also a county that is the home of Bridgeport, CT, one of the poorest cities in the Nation. In a relatively small area of geography, you have great diversity in income. 
This survey looked at young people's smoking habits. Interestingly, about 30 to 35 percent of the young people in the more affluent suburbs in the communities of Fairfield have already begun to smoke or abuse alcohol. In Bridgeport, however, the percentage of teenagers was much lower--10 to 13 percent. Why? There are many factors, but, clearly economics play a major role. The people who conducted this survey concluded that money does make a difference--that the ability of a teenager to buy a pack of cigarettes actually does affect the likelihood that he or she will smoke. 
Senator Conrad has included in his bill a tobacco tax of $1.50--the amount that public health experts tell us is necessary to effect a decrease in youth smoking. Senator Conrad has also laid out a plan for making use of the revenue raised by this increased tax on tobacco. I suspect that I was somewhat of a pest over the last 72 hours as he was getting ready to introduce this bill--in making repeated suggestions about how he could best make use of those funds. I am very pleased that Senator Conrad will be directing $14 billion of the revenues--of the $80 billion that will be generated in the next 5 years or so--toward improving the affordability, availability and quality of child care. 
My colleagues know, going back during the years of my tenure in the Senate, that I have spent a lot of time advocating for children's issues, particularly child care. So, I am deeply, deeply grateful to my colleague from North Dakota for agreeing to allocate such a substantial part of these dollars to the needs of children. I know my colleague from Rhode Island, Jack Reed, who 
was one of the first cosponsors on our comprehensive child care bill introduced last week and an active member of the Democratic Strike Force--Right Start 2000 that we formed in the Senate here to focus on children's issues, joins me in expressing our appreciation. 
While we are on the topic of child care, Mr. President, I'd like to share with my colleagues some new findings in the child care debate that relate to the issues of the cost and quality of child care. 
Mr. President, after we passed the welfare reform package in 1996 I asked the General Accounting Office if they would do a survey of States and give us some idea of how this law would affect the child care needs of families in this country. The GAO, just in the last few days, completed its survey and issued a report to the Subcommittee on Children and Families, of which I serve as ranking member. 
Let me just briefly share some of the conclusions of this GAO study about how welfare reform is affecting not only welfare recipients, but also working families. I think these findings highlight why the allocation that the Senator from North Dakota has directed to children's needs in his tobacco bill is so critically important. 
This report's findings are based on a survey of several States--California, Louisiana, Oregon, Texas, Washington, and Connecticut. First, let me offer the good news. According to the GAO States have done a very good job in meeting the needs of welfare recipients. Most families who need child care assistance in order to begin to enter the workplace are receiving it. Now, for some of the bad news. In order to help all of the welfare recipients, States had to severely limit the access of working families to child care subsidies. People who are right on that margin--not on welfare, but just over the line--are not getting the assistance they need. 
The survey indicates that access of working families to subsidies has been severely curtailed. Even if States draw down all of the Federal funds available, more than half--52 percent of working families in this country who need affordable child care--will be denied it. 
In Texas, one of the seven States surveyed, this means that over 37,000 working families remain on waiting lists for child care assistance. In California, even more dramatically, 200,000 working families are on waiting lists for child care assistance--some for over 2 years. Tragically, in my State of Connecticut, we just stopped pretending. We don't even keep waiting lists for new families. 
In this survey, the States also told the GAO about severe problems with the availability of child care. As we have known for years, certain types of care are not available at any cost--infant care, care for children with disabilities and care during nonstandard work hours. 
The GAO found that States are particularly concerned that the work participation requirements of welfare could exacerbate the shortage of infant care. Under welfare reform, mothers with children over the age of 1 are told they must work. Some States have chosen even tougher standards. In Wisconsin and Oregon, mothers with children older than 3 months must work. I find it somehow ironic that we now have Republican legislation pending that would offer incentives for parents to stay home with children under the age of 3 years--a wonderful idea--but yet we have in place a work requirement for welfare recipients with children over 3 months in some States. 
In many communities, child care for very young children is so limited that parents must sign up while they are still pregnant to have any chance of finding that care at all. 
Welfare reform is also exacerbating, according to GAO, the lack of child care during nonstandard work hours. Many welfare parents are finding jobs in service industries where shift work is required. Yet in most communities child care on weekends or after 
6 p.m. is nonexistent. 
When it comes to improving the quality, it is clear that States are making an effort. States are trying to improve provider training, to incresae provider compensation and to help facilities meet licensing standards, but they are still concerned that they are falling short. They are concerned, and rightly so, that as work participation requirements rise, quality may be compromised. 
This report is not about blaming the States. They are doing the best they can with a very big job. This is not about pitting welfare recipients against working families in the battle for limited child care dollars. It should be about making sure that the Federal Government provides sufficient resources so that parents who need safe and affordable child care in order to work can find it in this country. 
Senator Conrad's bill and the $14 billion in funding that it will provide will go a long way towards meeting those needs. I am pleased that the Senator from North Dakota has included in his tobacco legislation language directing these funds to the programs outlined in the Child Care A.C.C.E.S.S. bill which I introduced last week. I think it will go a long way toward ensuring that working families are going to get the kind of child care assistance and support they need. 
Again, I want to say to my colleague from North Dakota that I commend him immensely for the tremendous job he did, and I apologize to him publicly for being the source of some annoyance to him as I tried to get more money out of him for child care over the last several days. He very generously doubled the investment in child care from $7 billion to $14 billion. I thank him for that. Hope springs eternal. There may even be some additional resources made available for child care as we go through this debate. I am grateful to him and members of the tobacco task force for their attention to the needs of children and child care in their legislation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased this morning to join with the distinguished Senator from New Mexico and a group of my colleagues in cosponsoring this Senate Resolution designating October 18th through 24th as National Character Counts Week. 
Nothing that we do in this country will have a more direct impact on our collective future than how we educate our children. And as the face of our society changes, and children are faced with modern problems like illegal drug use and violence, we should look at ways to expand our traditional definition of education. We must recognize that education should be more than the transmission off acts. It ought to be more than the relaying of concepts. Education should also seek to develop the moral character of our children. Schools need to reinforce the lessons that children are taught at home. Education must help teach young people what they need to know to be good citizens in our society. Strengthening the mind is not enough. We must also nurture the character. 
That is why so many of us in the Senate come to the Floor each year to speak in support of character education in our schools. We believe that it is entirely appropriate for schools to instruct students on the importance of qualities like trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. This is not a substitute for disciplined instruction in reading, math, composition, and other subjects. This is simply an effort to instill in our young people the values that we cherish in a civil society. 
I have been working on character education issues for about 5 years now, and all of my experiences with this initiative have reinforced my belief that this is a good idea that can have a positive impact in the lives of our children. In 1994, I Introduced a character education amendment to the elementary and secondary education bill when it was being considered by the Labor Committee. This amendment was adopted, and it provided funding for schools to start character education curriculums. 
Over the past few years, I have had the pleasure of visiting schools in Connecticut that have received some of these funds and begun teaching character education. In each and every classroom, I have seen the positive impact that these programs are having in our children's lives. Children, as well as teachers and parents, are responding enthusiastically to these lessons, and the result has been better attendance, higher academic performance, and improved behavior among our students. Character education may be a relatively new initiative, but these programs are already reaching 100,000 students in the State of Connecticut alone. And character education is not only making a difference in my home State, but all over the country as many of my colleagues can confirm. 
Theodore Roosevelt once said, `To educate a person's mind and not his character is to educate a menace.' It is imperative that we build a society whose institutions will help support a strong ethical upbringing for our children, and character education should be a critical component of our efforts to reach that goal. 
Again, I commend my friend and colleague from New Mexico for all of his work in this area. And I invite all my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join us in supporting National Character Counts week and embracing character education as a vital means of molding better individual, strengthening families and creating a responsible American citizenry.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, throughout the years, I have had the opportunity to criss-cross the State of Connecticut countless times, and along the way I have met a number of remarkable individuals. Their occupations and backgrounds may vary, but they are all linked by a common commitment to helping others and making a positive difference in their communities. These are the unsung heroes in our society, and they are the foundation on which our communities are built. Sadly, Connecticut lost one its heroes earlier this month, when Jane Johnson of New Britain died at the age of 59. 
Jane Johnson's entire career was dedicated to working with poor and underprivileged children so that they may have a brighter future. A native of New Britain, she spent more than 30 years working in her home town's Head Start program, and for the past 17 years she served as its Director. 
I was fortunate to work with Jane over the years, and I, along with everyone else who knew her, had the highest regard for Jane and for her opinions on issues concerning children. Not only was she well-respected throughout the State but her efforts on behalf of young people earned her national recognition. That is why she was invited to several White House Conferences on Head Start. 
As if her efforts with Head Start were not enough, Jane also volunteered her free time to serve her community. She was involved with many service organizations, including as a member of the board of directors for the Sheldon Community Guidance Clinic and the United Way of New Britain. She was also active in her church, singing in the choir and actively working with the young people in the congregation. 
No one really knows exactly how many children showed up to their first day of school ready to learn and came closer to reaching their full potential because of Jane Johnson's efforts. But everyone in New Britain and throughout the State of Connecticut knows that she was a remarkable woman who touched many young lives and will be dearly missed.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the nomination of Dr. David Satcher to the positions of Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. 
I commend the president for selecting him to serve as a voice for the Nation's public health needs and goals. Dr. Satcher is a renowned physician, scholar and public health leader. During his tenure at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation saw a dramatic increase in childhood immunization rates as well as an increased capacity to respond to and detect emerging infectious diseases. In addition, while under Dr. Satcher's leadership, the CDC placed a significant emphasis on prevention programs, including efforts to screen low-income women for breast and cervical cancer. I also applaud his quest to protect the health of our nation's children by supporting research into prevention of deaths and injuries from gun injuries. 
Dr. Satcher, as has been noted on numerous occasions, is a remarkable individual of distinguished accomplishment. This Nation will be richer and better off were he to fill the job of Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health. 
I am distressed that there are some who want to make another issue of Dr. Satcher's nomination. There are those who would argue that there is no need for a position of Surgeon General. That has been raised in the past. I think that is a legitimate debate, although I happen to believe that having an Office of Surgeon General has been tremendously valuable to this country, having someone who can speak on behalf of the Nation in a clear voice about issues of national concern. No one better epitomized that role than Dr. C. Everett Koop, who led the Nation on numerous health care issues over the years, speaking very clearly. To this day he plays a very important role as a former Surgeon General of the United States. 
The position of Surgeon General has been vacant since December of 1994. We are now going to the fourth year not having filled this position. That is inexcusable. This Nation deserves to have a Surgeon General. 
As I said a while ago, if there are those who want to eliminate the position altogether, then offer legislation that will do that. But we have a position that needs to be filled, a position that can play an important role, as shown by various Surgeons General over the years, leading this Nation in the debate on health care issues. So I hope within the coming days here we can complete this nomination process and send it to the President and allow Dr. Satcher to assume the job of Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for health. 
Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I have a bill I want to introduce. I inquire as to whether or not it would be permissible for me to do so in this debate?

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me, first of all, say to my colleagues here, my intention, as I have said earlier, is to support the underlying legislation to name the airport in honor of Ronald Reagan. 
As I said yesterday, I certainly had no lack of disagreements with Ronald Reagan during the 8 years of his stewardship but believe that a two-term President deserves to be recognized. And if it is the desire of his family and others to rename this airport, given the fact it has had name changes over the years, I do not object to that. I had offered this amendment for the purpose of dealing in the future with these same issues. 
In a sense, Mr. President, it has become sort of a modern day graffiti when we run around naming things here willy-nilly, both on the Capitol grounds and in this city. We are mere custodians of these facilities; we don't own them, and we ought to have a process by which we make solid determinations about whose names are associated with great monuments, buildings and rooms that we have. When we as an institution decided to decorate the reception room with five of our former colleagues, it was Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy who chaired that commission--I look to my colleague from West Virginia as our historian--where a deliberative process went forward and that decision was made. 
It seems to me we as a body ought to adopt something like this so that we are not faced with these situations year in and year out. 
Now, Mr. President, I gather from talking with my colleague and friend from Georgia that my amendment to the underlying legislation is going to be rejected, but I hope that we might consider something like this amendment at the appropriate place. Unfortunately, what happens in the absence of a decision like this, these matters get shunted aside and we do not bring them up again until the next issue emerges. But I happen to believe that setting up a commission that would deal with these issues, having a commission made up of former Members to deal with Capitol grounds, possibly the Architect of the Capitol included, is the way we ought to go about the process of naming rooms, buildings, and renaming facilities, Federal facilities, here in Washington and elsewhere. 
Having said that, I know my colleague from Georgia will want to be heard on this. When he completes his comments, I will withdraw my amendment and hope that at some point in the not too distant future we can bring this matter up through the Rules Committee or other such committees where it would be appropriate. I see my colleague from Texas who I know is interested in this as well.

Mr. DODD. 
Madam President, the bill I send to the desk I send on behalf of myself and 24 of my colleagues whose names are included on the introduction of the legislation. The bill I have sent to the desk is called the Child Care and ACCESS bill, `ACCESS' standing for Affordable Child Care for Early Success and Security. As I said, I am pleased to be joined by 24 of my colleagues. There may be others in the coming days who care to join us in presenting what we believe is a comprehensive approach to dealing with an issue that I think all Americans--certainly I hope all in this Chamber--will recognize as a crisis: That is the crisis of child care. 
Almost on a daily basis, we read stories of children in child care settings who are left alone and then are discovered either with serious injury or worse. Many of them are left in certified and accredited child care centers. These stories highlight the critical importance of this issue. This is an issue that now affects 13 million children, the overwhelming majority of whom come from families where there is either a single parent or both parents must work in order to provide for the basic needs of their families. 
We have often felt in this country that we should not ask parents to make a choice between the job they need and the children they love, so child care has become a necessity. The question now is can we make it affordable for families? At a cost of $4,000 to $10,000 a year per child, is care accessible for parents who need it? Is the care they find going to be in a quality setting, where a child is safe? If the provider is a qualified parent, obviously her or she can provide for the needs of the child. But in this country, we know that too often qualified parents, in order to provide for the economic needs of their family, must provide a child care setting for their children. 
There's the issue of after-school care. 5 million children are home alone in this country. Any chief of police in this Nation will tell you that the most dangerous time for these children is not after 11 p.m. at night when many of the curfews are invoked, but rather between 3 and 8 o'clock, in the afternoon, when children are unsupervised. We don't have after-school programs for these kids where they can either stay in school or be involved in a worthwhile outside academic experience. So, there is a need here. 
When we discuss child care, we must also consider recent findings concerning early child development. We know how important these first 36 months of a person's life are, about the development of synapses that occur, about the nurturing that must go on in those years. We must make sure that parents can find quality care where there children will be intellectually stimulated, not simply warehoused. 
What we are doing today is presenting a piece of legislation which tries to deal in a comprehensive way with this issue of child care. This bill recognizes the needs of parents, working parents, middle-income families, those who are striving to achieve a middle-income status, poorer families in this country, providers who want to provide good child care but don't have the resources to do so, businesses that want to help their employees either by providing a child care setting, and businesses that want to assist their employees with help in attaining child care support. 
This legislation also includes an expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act, a piece of legislation that was signed into law 5 years ago tomorrow. It has already benefited literally thousands and thousands of families across this country. 
Today as part of this legislation we are calling for an expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act by lowering the threshold from 50 employees to 25. We think by including 13 million more Americans who, when faced with the crisis of choosing between their children and their jobs, ought not to be asked to make that choice. 
So this legislation includes an expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
At any rate, the challenge before us is certainly a significant one, and that is to create a child care system that works for America's families. As I said, for far too many families today when it comes to child care, they either have no choices or very bad choices. Here are some of the appalling statistics. They are incontrovertible, undeniable. 
Child care quality: Only one in seven child care centers provides care that promotes healthy development; child care at one in eight centers actually threatens children's health and safety. 
Infants and toddlers, our youngest and most vulnerable children, fare the worst. Almost half of infant and toddler care in our country endangers the health and safety of those who are in those centers. 
No State in this Nation has child care regulations in place that can be characterized as good quality standards. Two-thirds of the States have regulations that don't even address the basics--care giver training, safe environments, appropriate provider-child ratios. 
Even though we know that well-paid, educated and trained providers make a difference between poor and good quality child care, we pay caregivers in this country--almost all of them women--abysmally, some of them at well below the poverty levels, even though they're caring for our most precious possessions. 
As someone said not too long ago, children represent 27 percent of America's population, but they represent 100 percent of our future. These are the children that will be asked to be good employees, good employers, good citizens, and good parents, making a contribution to this Nation in the 21st century. 
Yet, for the 13 million children who are in child care environments today, the results are not good at all. We can either recognize that in this country and try and do something about it, or we can sit back and allow our system to continue to deteriorate and then face the judgment of history as to why we didn't stand up and try and put up some of the resources that we have to help these families. 
How does a family making $20,000 or $25,000 or $30,000 a year, with 2 or 3 children, afford care at $7, $8, $9, $10 thousand per year per child. The cost of some child care settings is in excess of some universities. 
Child care providers and centers workers average only $12,000 a year in pay, Madam President. That is just at the poverty level for a family of three. Home based providers average $9,000 a year. That is their income. 
Those are the people we are asking to provide for our children, making several thousand dollars below the poverty level. 
These numbers and statistics, by the way, come from national surveys and studies done by child care centers around the Nation. As I mentioned earlier, full day child care costs run from $4,000 to $10,000 per child. Because of a lack of funding, only an estimated one out of 10 eligible families actually received help in paying for care through the child care block grants which Senator Hatch and I authored eight years ago in this very Chamber. 
Good quality child care does cost more than mediocre quality, but not a lot more. An investment of only an additional 10 percent has a significant, positive impact on quality. 
And many types of child care remain unavailable at any cost, Madam President. Many new parents are dismayed to learn that care for infants is virtually nonexistent, and the problem is only getting worse. The General Accounting Office estimates that by the time the 50-percent work participation goal is reached in 2002, 88 percent of infants needing child care will not be able to find it. This corresponds to 24,000 young children in Chicago alone without child care. 
Let me repeat that. The General Accounting Office, not a partisan organization, estimates that by the time we reach the 50-percent work requirement in 2002, 4 years from now, 88 percent of infants in this country that need child care--we are not talking about choices now, it is not a question that someone is in an income category where they have a choice as to whether or not they are going to put a child in child care or stay home. We are talking about people who absolutely have to have child care. Eighty-eight percent of them will not be able to find it. 
We cannot let that happen, and this ought not to be a partisan debate about whether or not we see the facts. We know what is going to occur. Do we stand up and try and address it? 
In addition, there is a glaring lack of after-school programs. As I mentioned earlier, 5 million children are home alone. Eighth 
graders left home alone after school reported a greater use of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, the gateway drugs, than those who are in adult-supervised settings. 
The challenge, again, facing us is a straightforward one: to find a way to support families in the choices about how their children are cared for. I know that some will argue that child care is a private problem, one that families should be left to solve on their own. However, we don't expect families to shoulder the financial costs of educating their children alone. We provide public schools. We don't expect families to shoulder the burden of providing health care for their children alone. The vast majority of families have that cost subsidized through their employers. And as a nation, we have an interest in well-educated and healthy children, and so we accept that the Federal Government, States and employers play a role in getting us to these laudable goals of public education and health. 
Yet, when it comes to child care, we set families adrift. We tell them that it is a private problem, you have to solve it alone. The result is a system in which parents have less, not more, choices. The result is a nation in which child care is too often unaffordable, unavailable and unsafe. I believe that it is a compelling national interest in making sure that our children are safe and well cared for. 
I rise today to offer this plan that I have sent to the desk that will broadly improve the ability of families to make the right choice when it comes to their children's care. Twenty-four of my colleagues and myself--25 of us--have offered this bill. There are several main parts in our initiative. Let me touch on them briefly. 
One, improving the affordability of child care. Our legislation would provide an additional $7.5 billion over 5 years through the child care and development block grant, that I mentioned that Senator Hatch and I authored some eight years ago, to increase the amount of child care subsidies available to working families. This investment will double the number of children served by the block grant to 2 million by the year 2003. 
Secondly, we enhance the quality of child care in early childhood development. This legislation will provide some $3 billion over 5 years to encourage States to invest in activities known to produce significant improvements in the quality of child care. For example, we help the States with this $3 billion to bring provider-child ratios to nationally recommended levels. 
Again, I think most people understand this. Even if you have a well-trained adult, if they have too many children they are watching over, it doesn't work well. So we get to these ratios that those who understand this issue think are acceptable. With smaller infants, it is a very small ratio. As the children get a little older, the ratios can be a little broader. 
We improve the enforcement of quality standards by conducting unannounced inspections. 
Let me, as an aside, say that we had the head of the Defense Department's child care program testify the other day before a group of us. This is the best child care program in the world, by the way. Our Armed Forces serve 200,000 children all over the world everyday. 
The Defense Department would be the first to tell you not too many years ago they had the most dreadful system which was the subject of severe criticism as a result of national reports that were done on them. They have turned this around and, as I said, have now set up one of the best systems, if not the best system certainly, in this country if not in the world. 
One of the things they do is they have unannounced inspections of child care centers on military bases. Just recently, I went to the child care facility at the submarine base in Groton, CT. Really, they are doing a magnificent job--the providers, the staff, the children. This is a great sense of pride for our military personnel, our men and women, who must by necessity have child care. 
In the case of submariners, the men are off on submarines for weeks and weeks on end. Their spouses, if they are married with families, are working to supplement their incomes, and they need child care. To the Defense Department's great credit, they put in place a great system. Unannounced inspections make a difference. 
Conducting background checks on child care providers. Today, it is hardly done at all. Someone can move from State to State, get a job and then we find out there is a long record of abuse and other problems, and that goes on every day. 
Improve the compensation, education, and training of child care providers. I have already shared the statistics on what the average salaries are, $12,000 and $9,000. We pay parking attendants in this country higher salaries than we do people who take care of America's children. Your car is more likely to have someone with a better salary watching over it than your child. That is unacceptable, or should be, to all of us in this country. 
Educating parents on how to find good quality child care and ensuring that high quality care is available to children with disabilities. 
Those are some of the ways in which we try to help our States in this bill. 
Thirdly, we increase the availability and quality of school-age child care. This initiative will provide $3 billion over 5 years to increase the supply and quantity of school-age care through child care development block grants. In addition, we incorporate the model developed by Senator Boxer which ensures that schools play a central role in these efforts by providing the 21st century community learning centers with $1 billion over 5 years to create before- and after-school programs. 
Again, as an aside, I think all of us would agree, I hope, that our taxpayers build wonderful schools around our country, marvelous facilities. In many instances, they open at 8 or 9 in the morning, but then close in the afternoon, and are not open in the evening, weekends, vacations, summer months. We want to see the school buildings get more community use for children in after-school programs, adult education, summer programs, when kids are out of school. There ought to be ways in which we incorporate the use of these facilities to a larger extent than we have been able to. 
Fourthly, we expand the dependent care credit. This initiative would also expand the existing dependent care tax credit by nearly $8 billion over 5 years, following the model of Senator Harkin's earlier child care bill. 
We would adjust the sliding scale to increase the credit for families earning under $60,000 and index the credit for inflation to keep pace with the rising child care costs. 
We would also make the credit refundable so that families with little or no tax liability, those making under $30,000 a year, can receive assistance with child care expenses. I hope that this will not be a matter that ends up being a significant debate. On refundability, again, when people have incomes under $30,000, they don't pay Federal taxes or very few taxes, and if we don't make this refundable, then they are not going to get the benefit. It is to people at that income level struggling to make ends meet, it seems to me, that refundability is absolutely critical if they are going to get help. 
No. 5, supporting family choices in child care. Our legislation would also provide new support for families who make the difficult choice to forgo a second income or career and to stay at home to care for their children. We would allow stay-at-home parents with children under the age of 1 to claim a portion of the dependent care credit. This credit would also be made refundable to allow stay-at-home parents earning under $30,000 to benefit, and it is phased out for families earning over $70,000. 
There is a bill that has been introduced by our colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee. The Presiding Officer may, in fact, be a cosponsor of that bill. I know we have worked together on these issues. There is a difference here because the proposal being offered, I believe, by Senator Chafee treats parents who stay at home exactly the same way we treat parents who can't stay at home. 
In our bill, we do it a bit differently. I am very sympathetic of providing some help to parents who can make the choice, but if we provided it on a totally equal basis, it just becomes far too expensive. What we have done here is said, look, we are going to provide this assistance to you in the first year of that child's life. That cuts the cost by two-thirds. The reason I say that is because there are people out here who have no choice. I want to make this case. It is one thing to have the choice, that is a wonderful luxury, but for the overwhelming majority of the 13 million children who are in child care centers, their parents don't have the choice, they have to be there. 
It is not a question of `I would like to stay home, I have another spouse that is earning enough.' It is not a question of `I want to go play golf or go to the club and play cards.' These are people trying very hard on their own or with their spouse to hold their families together. So the choice doesn't exist for them. 
So it is not exactly equal in that sense. But I do think we should try to recognize and offer help where they do have stay-at-home parents, particularly for that first year. So we do provide that provision in our bill. I think it is a worthwhile one. I am hopeful we can reach some common ground. 
Madam President, we also expand the Family and Medical Leave Act, which I have already mentioned at the outset of my remarks. I invite my colleagues to go to a children's hospital in your State. Go to the waiting room in those hospitals. You will meet the parents who need protection under Family and Medical Leave. They will tell you about the difficulties. They will tell you, if they work for someone who employs 25 to 50 people, how difficult it is. There's the problems with health care, the insurance benefits. 
You go out to NIH here. Go to the Ronald McDonald House. Talk to parents who have children with extended illness problems where they can't stay at home, and they have to travel and be with their children. Talk to C. Everett Koop, a pediatrician. He will tell you about a child's recovery rate when they are with a parent, with a loved one who is with them. 
This ought not to be a controversial item, Madam President, to provide family and medical leave for working families, to be with their parents, to be with their children during a time of crisis. I just do not understand when people raise the kind of objections to trying to help out people in that situation. It ought to be a sense of national mortification that every other nation you can name provides a family and medical leave process. 
I can count colleague after colleague in this Chamber who had a problem with their children, had a problem with their parents, missed votes, did not go to committee hearings, and in fact had they been here and not been with their family they probably would have been subjected to political attack, that their priorities were wrong, that they were down here voting when they should have been with their children or parents at a time of illness. 
If we believe that to be the case among ourselves, is it asking too much to say, too, to parents who work outside of public life, that when they are faced with that crisis, that they ought not to have to choose between their job and their families? 
So I hope we can expand this benefit to the 13 million working people in this country who do not have the luxury of the Family and Medical Leave Act that others have enjoyed for the past 5 years. 
Madam President, No. 6, we encourage private sector involvement, which is a very important element in all of this. Child care cannot be the sole responsibility of Government, State, local or Federal. So our legislation will create a new discretionary program of competitive challenge grants in which communities that generate funds from the private sector would be eligible for matched Federal grants to improve the availability and quality of child care on a communitywide basis. 
This program would be authorized at $1 billion over 5 years. Based on the legislation of the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, which was approved, I might add, by the full Senate during the budget reconciliation bill of last year but dropped in conference, we would provide a new tax incentive to open high-quality, on-site child care centers or to assist employees in finding and paying for child care offsite. 
Many businesses, Madam President, understand what their employees are going through, and they want to help. But they are not affluent businesses. If they could get a little bit of help on paying their Federal taxes by providing onsite child care or assisting their employees, I think we would do a lot to expand the availability and the quality of child care. So we offer that to employers. 
Seventh, Madam President, we ensure the quality of Federal child care facilities. We would also ensure that the Federal Government would lead by example in providing its workers only the highest quality of child care. Many people would be surprised, I think, to hear that currently Federal child care facilities are 
exempt from State quality regulations. In this bill we require that all Federal child care centers meet all State licensing standards. 
Madam President, this is a comprehensive package. I have run down through the major provisions in a brief way. It is a long bill. It covers a lot of territory, a lot of ground. But it is a bold agenda, I think one that people of common purpose can come to. As the Presiding Officer and I see my colleague from Vermont, the chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, who is on the floor here, back in October, November we convened a group of us here, Democrats and Republicans, to try to fashion a compromise bill. We spent long hours, I know our staffs did, in trying to hammer out a bill that we could have presented to the full Chamber here in January. That was my hope. I know it was the hope of the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Maine. 
Well, that did not happen. I am not going to spend time here on why things didn't happen. There are various elements. But a new bill was introduced by Senator Chafee. I do not agree with all of it. There are parts I do agree with. In fact, there are parts that are exactly alike in both of these bills. 
I urge the leadership, the distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, the distinguished Democratic leader, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, who is a cosponsor, I might add, of this bill, that we try to set some time aside for this issue if we are only in session for 70 days, 100 days out of the 300 days left in this calendar year--at least that is what we have been told. I realize this is a big bill. It is not small. It is a lot of money over 5 years. A lot of ideas need to be thought out carefully. But we ought to be getting about the business, Madam President, of doing just that. This issue becomes more of a crisis and more of a problem and arguably more costly the longer we wait to address it. 
To the President's great credit, he identified this issue during his State of the Union Message--after school care, affecting millions of working families, early childhood development, that zero to 3 range, the brain studies that all of us are now very familiar with, the infant care, the provider assistance, the family assistance through the credits, the Family and Medical Leave Act. We ought to get about the business of trying to get a bipartisan bill that all of us can claim credit for. So we can say to the American public in 1998, `We heard your concerns. We recognize the problems coming down the road. We stepped up to the plate. We resolved our differences, and we presented you with our best efforts in this regard.' 
My sincere hope, Madam President, is that is what exactly will happen in these coming days. As I said, it is a bold agenda. It is comprehensive. And we must try to work together if we are going to succeed in that regard.

</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-dodd-ct-3-19980203</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in a moment I will send that amendment to the desk. First of all, on the underlying question here, in terms of the naming of the National Airport in honor of President Ronald Reagan, I support that, Mr. President. I realize others apparently do not, and I certainly respect people's right to make that decision. For those who have been around here long enough, I guess going back to the days when President Reagan served as President, there were not many issues on which we agreed. I fought rather vociferously on issues involving Latin America, domestic policy, and questions on a wide range of issues. But I happen to believe that the people who have served this country as President, elected twice, deserve recognition. Whether you agree with him or not, the people elected him twice to the highest office in our land, a position achieved only by some 41 or 42 people in the history of this country. So if this is what has been chosen by those who believe it is a proper way to recognize the contribution of Ronald Reagan, I respect that. 
It has been suggested that we haven't named anything for Harry Truman or Jimmy Carter, and I think that is a legitimate point. Certainly, those who want to do that--and I join them in that--ought to find an appropriate way to recognize their contributions. It seems to me that that ought not to detract from the effort here to name something in honor of Ronald Reagan. 
So if this is what the President's family and others believe, as I said a moment ago, is an appropriate and proper way to recognize him, then this Senator--this Democrat, if you will, which comes secondary to my role in the Senate, and as a citizen--I am going to support that decision. I noted earlier that it took many years before we were able to recognize Franklin Delano Roosevelt with a monument. He was one of the greatest Presidents in this century, having led us during the Great Depression and a world war. I was saddened that day when the ceremonies opened up that wonderful memorial, and it occurred to me that there weren't many people on the other side of the aisle there. 
We ought to take politics out of these decision whenever possible. I call for the establishment of a commission so that, henceforth--not on this issue, but henceforth when we decide to name or rename facilities, there ought to be a deliberative way in which we proceed. Too often these issues are raised when a particular monument is up for consideration, and based on whether people agree or disagree with that choice, there are suggestions about sending this off to a commission or some group for consideration. I understand that, but too often once that issue is put aside and ended, we go back to business as usual and never come back to how we consider these issues. 
So the amendment that I am offering establishes a commission. It does not condition this naming on the commission being established, but rather it is prospective. So that in the future when such namings or renamings will occur, there is a process by which we can do it. 
I offer a second part of this amendment, which is a Sense-of-the-Senate resolution that has to do with the naming of facilities here on the Capitol grounds. Rather than trying to write statutory law here, I just made it a Sense-of-the-Senate resolution that would establish a commission made up of former Members of Congress from both parties. So that on the Capitol grounds when we are naming rooms or facilities within the Capitol here, there would also be a deliberate process by which we go, and that is really a sense of the Senate. The idea is that it would give our former colleagues a role to play when the issue arose as to whether or not we ought to name buildings, facilities, porticoes, or balconies that have been named in the past. I think as temporary custodians of these wonderful grounds of the Capitol, we ought to be deliberate and cautious in how we go about naming these facilities, so that long after we are gone, there is an appropriate designation that the test of time would wear well. 
I point out to my colleagues that, in the last 24 hours or so, we have heard of the people who have just been named to the National Basketball Association Hall of Fame. What is the relationship? I note that there is a requirement that there be a period of 5 years since the person has left professional basketball before they can even be considered. I note that Larry Bird, someone I admired immensely, as most Americans did for his great skill on the basketball court, I suppose you might have made the case when he retired in 1992 that he should have been named immediately. Yet, the rules are that you have to wait 5 years and then a board thinks about it, analyzes it, and makes its judgment. 
All I am suggesting here is as temporary custodians, for these wonderful Capitol grounds, that we ought to establish a similar kind of a process before we go off and name buildings and rooms and facilities and other parts of these grounds for people who may be very well deserving of such a designation, but the test of time and a little deliberation would serve us all well and serve future generations well accordingly. 
So there are two parts of this amendment. First is that we would establish, by law, a commission that would consider naming, in future days, Federal facilities around the country. And the second part is a sense of the Senate to deal with the Capitol grounds and buildings. 
Mr. President, as I say, this is prospective. It doesn't affect the decision of naming the National Airport for Ronald Reagan. I support that. I said to my colleagues that, despite whatever differences--and they were significant--I had with this American President, I believe that naming such an airport for him is not inappropriate. In fact, having served this Nation for 8 years as President, chosen by the American public, a designation such as this in his honor is appropriate, and I support that. 
With that, I will be happy to yield the floor.

Mr. President, if I may inquire further, I was just told--I apologize to my colleague from Virginia, Senator Robb--it is my understanding that the distinguished Democratic leader would be offering the commission amendment. All I was suggesting is if it is appropriate at the proper time that an unanimous consent request would provide an order for these amendments so there would be a proper flow here in a way that we would consider the amendment of the Senator from Virginia, I suspect, prior to mine, and then mine. If that would be the order, again, I am here on the floor because I have another engagement and was asked to come over and properly deal with the amendment which I want to offer. There was no attempt to try to get ahead of anybody in line. Maybe a sequencing of these amendments would serve everybody's interest. I would have no objection to that, if the amendment of the Senator from Virginia can be considered prior. We can deal with this at a later point.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me, first of all, commend my colleague from New Mexico for the very thoughtful statement on education, on the importance of it. I did not hear all of the statements made earlier. I know my colleague from West Virginia, the senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, discussed the issue of transportation and the importance of the ISTEA bill, the intermodal transportation system bill, which has to be brought up very quickly here. I heard our junior Senator from West Virginia discuss the issue of Medicare and health care. So a number of these items the President discussed last evening in his State of the Union Message have been the subject of some discussion here today. 
I think all of us were very impressed with the agenda the President has laid out for this session of this Congress, the remaining 70 to 120 days. The distinguished majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Senator Lott, has indicated this will not be a long session. So we have a relatively short amount of time for an agenda that I think is important for the country. I hope many of these items will be considered in a strong bipartisan sense. Some will obviously provoke some disagreements. Minimum wage and family and medical leave are two items that come to mind immediately. But I hope on things like Medicare and Social Security and building our public schools and campaign finance reform, we can find some common ground here and get the business of the country done. 
Mr. President, I would like to focus some remarks, if I could, on a subject that is I think critically important. The President spent some time discussing it last evening. It is one that I had worked on for about a month and a half here, during the month of December and a good part of the month of January, with a bipartisan group of Republicans and Democrats, and that subject is child care. 
Unfortunately, in the last week, I received some correspondence from our colleagues on the Republican side who decided to pull out of the effort basically to come up with another bill. I understand Senator Chafee of Rhode Island has introduced a bill that, in many ways, reflects the work product of those 6 weeks, where I had tried to see in that quiet time if we could come out with a proposal that we could rally around here. Unfortunately--and this happens--these things break apart. I hope at some point we will come back together again. This is important. We have introduced a bill on our side, so there are two bills out there. The President laid out some thoughts and ideas on it. Let me say to you, Mr. President, how important this issue is. We are talking about millions of families in this country that are either single parents raising children, or two-income parents that need both incomes. They may have children and have to pay the tremendous cost of child care because, obviously, you can't leave them home alone. Maybe they don't necessarily have grandparents or aunts and uncles around to take care of them on a daily basis. It poses a serious problem for parents. When schools close down for snow days during the winter. What do you do with your children when you have to go off to work? You have the job you need and the children you love. How do you reconcile these issues? 
In the past, many of us grew up in a situation where you had neighbors and friends and you would accommodate an occasion when a crisis like that emerged. Today, it is a daily effort, if a family is to make ends meet and fulfill these obligations. The average cost of a child care setting is between $4,000 and $9,000 per child per year. If you are making, as the average family does, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000 a year, with two children that need some care because they are minors or infants, you immediately get a sense of how difficult a situation people can be placed in financially. 
What we have proposed is to expand the block grants, to come up with some tax credits--by the way, tax credits not just to families who have children they want to place in care, but to 
families who decide they are going to try and get along with one income. Some parents are going to stay home. We provide the credits for them as well. We make it refundable, too, Mr. President, because people who make that $30,000 and below don't pay taxes. Yet, many of them are out there just barely getting along. If they don't have a refundable tax credit, they don't get any benefit at all. So we refund the tax credits for those families that either want to stay home with their child or place that child in a child care setting, because they need that extra help to get along. On the stay-at-home parent idea--and I am delighted to see more and more coming to this issue--I authored something called the Family and Medical Leave Act, which was a source of some controversy back in the 1980's. It took me 7 years. It went through 2 vetoes, and as the President said, it was the first bill he signed into law in 1993. That was basically a stay-at-home parent idea. The idea was that if your child is facing a medical crisis or serious problem that could be documented, that a parent could make the choice to take 12 weeks away from their job, up to 12 weeks, without pay, without losing their job. We were the only country that I could find among industrialized nations that didn't permit a family and medical leave policy, giving parents the ability to stay at home and care for their children without losing the job that they need. 
So the idea of providing some assistance for parents who want to stay at home and care for their children, I think, is a very sound idea. I hope we don't get into the situation where we cause stay-at-home parents and those who must work to be pitted against each other, to cause a quarrel, if you will, between parents who don't have that choice. If you are raising 2 or 3 kids on your own, the idea that you have a choice to stay home and watch them is nonexistent. You don't have that choice. Or if you are a two-income family barely getting by or you want to invest money that you are earning for their education, or to buy a better home, or to plan a vacation, you should not be branded somehow as an uncaring parent because you made that choice. I don't want to see us get into a debate here and suggest somehow that parents who need that second income are less caring about their children because they make that choice, any more than I want to see us deprive parents who make that choice to be at home by not providing them with help so that they can do that. 
So I am hopeful that we can come to some common ground here. We have begun Welfare to Work. We have a lot more people in the work force. We don't have the child care vacancies, and we don't have the high-paying child care workers, as the average income is $12,000 a year. I don't know anyone who can now get along on that income. How do you attract good people to care for our children in this society? 
There have been studies done recently about the quality of child care programs around the country. Some 17 States now have certification processes. Yet the Ziegler Child Study Center at Yale University would tell you that even in the States that have certification and accreditation processes the quality of child care is embarrassing. It is mortifying. 
So for States that do not have that certification process you can imagine what it is like. In fact, if you pick up almost any daily newspaper in any city or any State in the country, you will find a case almost on a daily basis of parents who placed their child in what they thought was a safe, quality child care setting only to discover, of course, that child is not safe, and lost its life as we have seen in numerous cases. So we need to be far more conscientious. 
We don't deal with quality here in Washington. We don't set standards. I realize that is too high a hurdle to probably overcome. So we let the States set the standards. There is nothing in our Federal bill that mandates what standards are. But we do think there ought to be at least health and safety standards. We require that for our pets. If you leave them at a vet or in one of these weekend kennels, you get a State requirement of safety and health standards for your puppies. It seems to me, if we are going to require that minimum standard for animals that we might try it for our own children in this country. 
So our bill provides assistance to employers and providers of child care, and to parents who want to have the security of knowing their children are in safe places. 
To give you an idea of how serious this problem is, in the State of Florida today, there is a need of 40,000 spaces for child care that are nonexistent in the State. We are told with Welfare to Work that number will increase by 440,000 in the coming year. So you are going to have an explosion, I guess, of child care providers. What will be the quality? How much will the cost be? Is it accessible to people? The State of Florida may be an example where the vacancy rate is particularly high. But it is not unique. Other States across the country are facing similar problems. 
I was disappointed when I saw the list of the 19 priority items that the majority leader has placed before us in this brief session that child care is not on that list of 19. Child care is not on that list. We went through the debate on welfare reform a year or so ago. One of the promises made in this Chamber was that as we moved people from welfare to work, we would do something about caring for the children of these people who have been on welfare. What we are being told now, with this priority list of 19, is that child care is not on that list; that working families who are trying to make ends meet in caring for their children are not going to be a part of this agenda in the next 70 or 120 days of a legislative process. I am hopeful that agenda can change, that it is not written in concrete, that there will be an opportunity to make the case that we ought to be able to come up with a compromise bill if need be between Republicans and Democrats that takes out the partisanship on this issue and says that we ought to be able to come up with some idea here that can assist these working families. 
I know my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, with whom I wrote the child care block grant program 13 years ago, and my colleague from Kansas, Senator Pat Roberts, care very much about this issue. Senator Jeffords cares about this issue, and had his own bill up earlier. Obviously, Senator Chafee does. He has a bill in. I know my colleagues from Maine, Senator Collins and Senator Snowe, and Senator Specter have an interest in this. I am just disappointed. I can't hide it--that having invested 6 weeks 
of staff time and effort to try to come up with a compromise bill that it all falls apart literally in the last few days after we pretty much had a work product. 
So I am going to continue to raise this issue. I am glad the President did last night. I am glad he highlighted it. I think a lot of people in this country understand in very graphic ways how important this issue is to them for their neighbors and their coworkers. They understand it. They see every day what goes on, how difficult this is, how costly it is, and how worried people are. After-school care is a big issue in this context. We put over $3 billion over 5 years in after school care. 5 million children every day are home alone between 3 o'clock and 6 o'clock and 7 o'clock. Any police chief in any town will tell you the problems that kids get into is not after 11 p.m. at night when people want to put in curfews. Where kids get in trouble is in the afternoon between 3 o'clock and 8 o'clock. That is when trouble occurs. Seventy percent of our schools in this country have no after-school care programs at all. It seems to me that we ought to do something about that. I am not just talking about infants but young children in elementary schools. Try and dial a phone in a relatively small community between 3 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. in the afternoon. There is a delay between the last digit you dial and when the phone actually clicks in. That is because the phone system is overloaded with parents calling their homes to make sure their kids have gotten home safely. 
So after-school care is a part of our effort and a part of this proposal that we will put before this body. 
So with those thoughts I am urging our colleagues to see if we can't find some common ground. Hopefully the majority leader will change that agenda to include child care on it with the recommendation of the administration. We are not arguing now with an executive branch over whether or not we ought to do this. 
There are two bills here that it seems to me we should move on. I am going to raise this issue at every opportunity I can in the coming weeks to see to it that before this session of this Congress adjourns that this U.S. Senate will address child care, after-school care, and care for parents who want to stay at home, and that these parents are going to get some relief before we call it quits. I think it is a critical issue and one that ought to be one of our top priorities rather than not a priority at all. 
With that I yield the remainder of my time, if any of my colleagues want to take a few minutes before the time expires. I see my colleague from New Jersey.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate 11 organizations, companies, and municipalities in my home State of Connecticut for being named to the honor roll of the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Labor. This honor roll recognizes entities across the country that have made a commitment to working women and to a family-friendly workplace. Most Americans go to work each day worried about their health care, affordable and reliable child care, living wages, and job protection in times of family crisis. These organizations are trying to help alleviate some of these worries and should be applauded for their efforts. 
The 11 honorees from Connecticut are: Aetna Inc., the city of New Britain, the Connecticut Women's Education and Legal Fund, DCC/The Dependent Care Connection Inc., the Entrepreneurial Center at Hartford College for Women, GTE Service Corp., ITT Hartford, Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co., United Illuminating Co., United Technologies Corp., and the Urban League of southwestern Connecticut. 
These entities are helping working women to achieve better pay and benefits, to strike a better balance of work and family responsibilities, and to gain more respect and opportunity on the job. For example, flexible work schedules and interactive retirement planning software allow more women to pick up a sick child from school or help plan for their and their families' financial future. Other programs instituted by these family-friendly Connecticut organizations include discounted on-site day care, at-home offices, extensive prenatal care, and seminars to assist families with college planning. 
The American work force is changing. When The Department of Labor Women's Bureau was created by Congress in 1920, there were only 8.25 million working women--less than 20 percent of our Nation's work force. Today, nearly 60 million women work for pay --almost 50 percent of our Nation's work force. Not only are more women working, but more women must work to make ends meet for their families. America's work force and families are facing new challenges and it is organizations like these 11 that deserve to be applauded for making innovative and constructive efforts to make their workplaces more family-friendly. 
As we applaud these honor roll members we must also remember that there are challenges that still need to be addressed in our changing workplace. By and large, American working women still have difficulty finding affordable child care, paid sick leave, and unpaid family leave during an extended family crisis. And let us not forget that women continue to face discrimination in hiring and promotion, as well as underpayment in comparisons to men with the same or similar credentials. 
Though we have made some progress, such as passing the Family and Medical Leave Act, it is obvious we still have challenges to overcome. So, let's applaud the companies, organizations, and municipalities on the Labor Department's honor roll for working women. And let's continue to struggle toward solutions to make every workplace a family-friendly workplace.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer congratulations to an outstanding mathematics teacher, Marianne Roche Cavanaugh, who has been named the 1998 Connecticut Teacher of the Year. Mrs. Cavanaugh has demonstrated a lifetime of dedication to the students of Glastonbury's Public Schools, and she has set a standard of excellence for both her students and other educators. I want to express my gratitude and admiration for the commitment that she has displayed over her 22 years in teaching. 
Mrs. Cavanaugh has had a distinguished career marked with various awards and achievements. She single-handedly created the Gideon Wells Marathon--an academic and community involvement program for 7th and 8th graders. Since 1994, students have raised more than $20,000 by securing pledges for each math problem they solve in 1 hour during the Marathon. The accumulated funds have been donated to charities chosen by the students. In addition, Mrs. Cavanaugh has directed district-wide professional development, and has co-developed a problem solving math curriculum, which emphasizes writing, calculator use, problem solving, and interdisciplinary activities. Imaginative and productive ideas such as these have earned Mrs. Cavanaugh the distinction of being a finalist for the prestigious Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching in both 1986 and 1998, as well as being the winner of the Celebration of Excellence Award in 1986. 
The purpose of the Connecticut Teacher of the Year Program is to identify, from among many outstanding teachers, one teacher to serve as a visible and vocal representative of what is best in the profession. Through her innovative ideas, dedication to the institutional development of mathematics, and love for her profession and her students, Mrs. Cavanaugh has clearly earned this prestigious honor. 
While I commend Mrs. Cavanaugh for her display of excellence in teaching, I want also to mention that her work is representative of the work of many educators that too often remain unrecognized. A survey done by the National Center for Education Statistics in 1995 found that only 54 percent of all teachers feel respected by society in their profession. Teachers fill an enormously important role in shaping the developmental experiences of children during the impressionable ages of childhood and adolescence. They serve not only to educate, but to mentor, motivate, influence, and inspire our children. Thanks to Mrs. Cavanaugh and other quality teachers like her throughout the State and the Nation, we have a brighter future ahead of us.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize the work of one of my constituents--William D. Moore of Old Saybrook, Connecticut. Bill left his post as Executive Director of the Southeastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce this month and his work in that post deserves special recognition. 
Bill has been at the helm of so many economic and development initiatives in the Southern portion of our state that it is hard to list all of them in this brief statement. But without a doubt, it is Bill's leadership through some of the most difficult economic times in our state that really stand out in my mind. 
When the very first round of base closures were being proposed in the Pentagon in 1989, it was Bill Moore who literally marshaled the forces in Southern Connecticut. He recruited some of the most dynamic and brilliant minds in our state to come together and review every single document, every single calculation, and even the very computer model used to analyze the various Groton-New London regional facilities under the Defense Department's review. Bill created one of the most cohesive and effective team strategies ever presented to address the economic impact issues which clearly were not being assessed by the Pentagon. 
Although not all of our efforts were successful, it was Bill's foresight and commanding presence that eventually led our team to victory in the fight to remove the New London Submarine Base from the Base Closure list in 1993. As a measure of credit, the Base Closure Commission belatedly admitted that the Navy's assumptions used to evaluate New London were flawed. Bill Moore was the man who first presented that information to the commission. 
However, Bill's efforts have gone far beyond that monumental task. He has been the usher at the door of an entire new economic era for Southeastern Connecticut. Just as the defense down-sizing efforts were taking their ravenous toll on our state and New London County in particular, Bill encouraged and fostered new development for our state and helped bring about a more level-headed transition for our heavily defense weighted economy. For example, he assisted in the appropriation of funds to rebuild the Connecticut State Pier and helped with the private-public partnerships that have rebuilt downtown New London. That was no small task. 
During Bill's tenure, the membership of the Southeastern Chamber has more than doubled. Clearly, the contributions of those members have made New London County what it is today. 
Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention Bill's contributions during the creation and expansion of two of the most successful Indian gaming facilities in the hemisphere. Bill's unique skills and perseverence made this transition for our region a positive and inclusive process. 
In closing, let me just add my personal thanks and congratulations to Bill and his family. I wish Bill and Maureen every success in their new endeavors.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my colleagues who have spent innumerable hours creating a bill that will bring lifesaving drugs and medical devices to the American people more quickly and efficiently, without compromising safety or effectiveness. 
First, Senator Jeffords is to be commended for his leadership. His staff, most notably Jay Hawkins and Sean Donahue, also deserve our appreciation for their hard work and dedication to seeing this legislation enacted. 
Although the process was at times a difficult one, I'm pleased to say that a spirit of bipartisanship and compromise ultimately prevailed, as evidenced by the overwhelming Senate vote of 98 to 2 in September on this bill. 
I'd also like to thank my fellow Senate conferees--Senators Kennedy, Coats, Harkin, Gregg, Mikulski, Frist, and DeWine for their successful efforts to negotiate a workable compromise with our colleagues in the House. 
We should take pride in the legislation that has been created--the first substantial update of FDA's rules for regulating drugs and devices since the 1970's. 
We should take pride in the fact that this bill will speed critical products to patients without compromising the high safety standards that Americans have come to rely on. 
Mr. President, I'd like to speak for a moment about some of the positive reforms contained in this bill. 
At the heart of the bill is the 5-year reauthorization of PDUFA, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act--a piece of legislation remarkable for the fact that there is unanimous agreement that it really works. 
In the 5 years since this initiative was created, the fees collected under PDUFA have cut drug approval times in half. With its renewal as part of this bill, we can expect drug approval times to drop an additional 10 to 16 months. 
In addition, by improving the certainty of product review process, this bill encourages U.S. companies to continue to develop and manufacture in the United States. This bill asks the FDA and industry to begin collaborating early in the approval process to prevent misunderstandings about agency expectations that ultimately could delay a needed product from reaching consumers. 
This bill also establishes or expands upon several mechanisms to provide patients and other consumers with greater access to information and to lifesaving products. 
For example, this bill will give individuals with lifethreatening illnesses greater access to information about ongoing clinical trials of drugs--information that may offer the only hope for those patients who have not benefited from treatments already on the market. 
Based on a bill originally championed by Senators Snowe and Feinstein, I offered an amendment in committee, which I was pleased to see adopted, to expand an existing AIDS database to include clinical trials for all serious or lifethreatening diseases. 
Individuals struggling with chronic and debilitating diseases should not be burdened with the daunting task of searching, without assistance, to locate studies of promising treatments. This database will provide one-stop-shopping to help those patients quickly and easily access vital information. 
Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that this bill incorporates the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, legislation originally introduced by our former colleague from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, and now cosponsored by myself and Senator DeWine. 
This provision addresses the problem of the lack of information about how drugs work on children, a problem that President Clinton recognized recently as a national crisis. 
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only one-fifth of all drugs on the market have been tested for their safety and effectiveness in children. This legislation provides a fair and reasonable market incentive for drug companies to make the extra effort needed to test their products for use by children. 
I was pleased to join Senator Jeffords as the first Democratic cosponsor of this bill. I would thank him again for the hard work and long hours that he and his staff have contributed. 
I look forward to joining my colleagues in voting in favor of this legislation. 
Let me join here, Mr. President, the chorus of praise for those who have been involved in putting this bill together. It has been a long journey and not always an easy one, but I think the final product is a good one. I commend the chairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords, and his staff, Jay Hawkins, Sean Donohue, Jeanne Ireland of my staff, for their hard work and dedication in seeing this process to its conclusion. We swept the Senate with an overwhelming vote of 98 to 2 on what I thought was a good bill. Our conferees worked very hard. I thank Senators Kennedy, Coats, Harkin, Craig, Mikulski, Frist, and DeWine for their successful efforts in this area as well. 
This is a critically important piece of legislation that will expedite the process of getting needed medicines and devices to patients, without compromising safety or effectiveness. That was a desired goal of everybody here. 
Let me, if I can, mention two or three provisions in the bill that I think are worthy of special note. One, of course, is a 5-year reauthorization of PDUFA, which is very, very important. I think it demonstrates the success of the PDUFA and how well it worked over 5 years. 
Secondly, I also would like to commend our colleagues for accepting the several mechanisms to provide patients and consumers with greater access to information and to life-saving products. For example, this bill gives individuals with life-threatening illnesses greater access to information about ongoing clinical trials and drugs that could be very, very important to them and their families. By the way, Senator Snowe and Senator Feinstein deserve particular credit. It was originally their idea that we incorporated in the bill, the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. Former Senator Kassebaum of Kansas originally authored that idea, Mr. President. Senator DeWine and I included it in this bill. I think it has been improved upon in the conference. It is a very important provision that could make a huge difference for young children and their families who want to have reliable products that will become available to them. 
So, Mr. President, let me conclude by again thanking all those who have been involved in this process. Passing this legislation can truly be considered one of the very fine achievements of this first session of this Congress. I look forward to its effectiveness with the American consumer.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President. As 1998 rolls around, so does another election. But this upcoming campaign season will be different from any other that I have ever known. For the first time since I entered public office in 1974, a certain dapper reporter with a flower in his lapel will not be there reporting the facts of the campaign and offering his assessments. Don O. Noel, Jr., who is one of the most prominent and respected journalists in Connecticut history, has retired after working for 39 years as a political reporter in Hartford. 
Don Noel's career as a journalist dates all the way back to 1958, the year that my father was elected to the first of two terms as a U.S. Senator. It is amazing for anyone to have such a long career in any field, particularly in an area as mentally, physically, and emotionally demanding as journalism. 
Don Noel started out as a writer for the Hartford Times, where he worked for 17 years. For a change of pace, he ventured into television journalism and spent a decade at WFSB-TV Channel 3. He eventually returned to print journalism in 1984 when he became a political columnist for the Hartford Courant, where he stayed until his retirement. 
Don Noel was an old-school reporter in the truest and best sense of the term. He was always courteous and respectful of the people he interviewed and wrote about. At the same time, he refused to skirt around difficult issues and never refrained from asking stinging questions or making pointed comments. He felt that part of his role as a journalist was to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. 
Don Noel was able to succeed for so long because he was a reporter of substance who cared about the truth and cared about his readers. He understood that his role as journalist was to hold politicians accountable for their actions and to serve as a watchdog on behalf of the general public. 
Don Noel did more than simply report the facts, he also interpreted them. As an editorial page writer, he was responsible for offering his opinions on the issues of the day. Not everyone agreed with his ideas, but everyone respected them because they were always thoughtful and well-developed. Most of Mr. Noel's criticisms were aimed at those who tended to be a bit more conservative, but to the end he remained an equal opportunity critic. It didn't matter if you were a Democrat, Republican, or Independent; if you were a public official and Don Noel thought that you were anything less than an upstanding public servant, it's safe to say that your name would be in the paper that week. 
One of his colleagues at the Hartford Courant noted that Don Noel was an institution not because of the number of years he put into service, but how well he applied them. I strongly concur with these sentiments and believe that Don Noel was one of the finest people that I have had the pleasure of knowing during my career in politics. 
While his retirement is truly a loss for the people of Connecticut, I am glad that he will finally have more time to do the things that he truly enjoys. He has said that he plans to spend a good deal of his new-found free time doing community service work in the neighborhoods of northwest Hartford, where he has volunteered for more than a decade. He also hopes to travel with his wife and have an opportunity to try other kinds of writing in which he won't have a deadline hanging over his head. Whatever he chooses to do in his retirement, I wish him only the best, and I thank him for his many years of service to the people of Connecticut.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute the Wethersfield Teen Theater Company, which is about to celebrate its 10th anniversary. This company was founded in 1988 by 15-year-old Bill Fennelly who was frustrated by the lack of opportunities in the theater for young people in the Wethersfield area, and the name of the company that Bill created indicates what makes this group so unique and special--it is run by and for teenagers. 
Whether it's the director, the choreographer, or a member of the lighting crew, every member of the company must be between the ages of 11 and 21. The company members have complete artistic control over their productions, and they are also responsible for raising money and doing publicity for each play. Not only has the Wethersfield Teen Theater given hundreds of young people an opportunity to express themselves artistically and experience the feeling of performing live on the stage; but this company also gave many young people leadership opportunities that people their age don't traditionally enjoy. People who participate in the Wethersfield Teen Theater learn lessons about personal responsibility that they will carry with them throughout their lives. 
When the theater company was founded there were many doubters. Not only were people skeptical that a group of teenagers would be able to put on a quality theatrical production, there were questions about their ability to raise the money to stage a production. The Wethersfield Teen Theater put on a spring review called `On Broadway,' and they were able to raise the money to stage a production of `Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat.' 
`Joseph' was major success, and in 1990, the teen theater gained the official sponsorship of the Wethersfield Recreation and Parks Department. While the sponsorship provides the company with free rehearsal and performance space, the theater company is not a budgeted program and the teens still must earn all the money required to produce each show. 
Since its founding, the Wethersfield Teen Theater Company has put on a major summer and spring production every year. In addition, the company also sponsors children's workshops that are designed to get children interested in theater. They also perform at local community events, elementary schools, and hospitals. 
For a decade, people have been enjoying the talent, enthusiasm, and creativity of the Wethersfield Teen Theater Company, and on January 3, 1998, the group will celebrate its 10th Anniversary with the performance of a production called `Our Time.' I am certain that this production will be a great success, and I hope that this wonderful theater company will continue enriching the lives of young people in the Wethersfield area for many decades to come.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, within every town in the country, there are a small handful of families or individuals whose achievements and contributions to their community are so extraordinary that they become as much a part of the town's landscape as Main Street, the Court House, or City Hall. The Vece's are such a family in the town of Clinton, CT. 
For decades, Vece family members have been on town boards and commissions, working on countless charity and civic events. The Vece family's contributions to town life were even honored in 1995, when the Pierson School gazebo was renamed the Vece Gazebo. But the greatest illustration of what this family meant to the vitality of this small New England shoretown could be seen once a week at a local restaurant. Each Sunday from 4 to 8 p.m. for the past 16 years, a diverse group of patrons would gather at Bill's Seafood Restaurant to enjoy the music of Clinton's favorite band. The people of Clinton loved coming out and singing the songs that they all knew, but what they loved most was the band's leader--Dan Vece, Sr. What set Mr. Vece apart from other bandleaders was not the great musical skill with which he played the banjo. What made Dan Vece so special was his zest for life. That, and the fact that he was over 100 years old. 
Seeing Dan Vece on stage wearing his trademark sailor's cap and picking at his 1919 Gibson banjo, served to remind countless people that life was meant to be enjoyed. He served as an inspiration to anyone who was fortunate enough to meet him. Sadly, on September 23, 1997, Dan Vece, Sr. died at the age of 101. 
Dan Vece, Sr. grew up and lived in New Haven, CT until he enlisted in the Army during World War I. After being discharged from the Army, he returned to New Haven where he married his wife of 68 years, Tilly Tullo. Together they moved to Clinton in 1919, where they operated a retail plumbing store and service. In addition to his business, Mr. Vece was one of Clinton's first police officers and served as a fireman, beginning the longstanding family tradition of public service. Mr. Vece enjoyed working and didn't retire until he was 80 years old, and he continued doing odd jobs until he was 88. He played golf until he was 96, and drove a car until he was 98, transporting senior women to the grocery store. Dan Vece was involved in countless activities, but his true passion was always his music. 
He had no formal musical training, but he taught himself to play most any musical instrument that he could get his hands on. His wife was a trained musician and together they formed a band with Tilly on piano and Dan on the drums. They played together at the ice shows in Clinton and all the big jobs from New Haven to New London. And after each gig, they always loved to go out dancing. 
Eventually, Tilly retired from performing, but Dan carried on and fronted a band that played at restaurants and resorts along the Connecticut shoreline, various jazz festivals, nursing homes, schools, and of course Bill's Seafood Restaurant on Sunday evenings. Whenever anyone asked why he was still performing, Mr. Vece would always say that his doctor told him that music was the best medicine and he should keep on playing as long as possible. 
Well, Dan Vece followed his doctor's orders, and as a result he brought happiness into the lives of countless individuals. Dan Vece, Sr.'s good humor, devotion to his community and remarkable vitality made him a beloved figure in Clinton and throughout Connecticut. He was loved and revered by all, and he will be dearly missed.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the greatest lawyers in recent American history--Bernard G. Segal, who died earlier this year. Bernard Segal, who served as the president of the American Bar Association in 1969-70, was known as the conscience of the bar, and some of his colleagues said that he promoted individual rights and the rule of law more than any other lawyer of our time. 
Bernard Segal's legal accomplishments began at an early age, as he was named directly out of Penn Law School to serve as deputy attorney general of Pennsylvania. At age 24, he was the youngest person to ever hold this post, but he still proceeded to write many important pieces of legislation, including the State's banking code. He left this position to be a founding partner of the Philadelphia law firm of Schnader, Harrison, Segal & Lewis. As a member of the firm, he was very successful, representing many blue-chip clients such as Bell Telephone, NBC, and United Parcel, and during his career he argued nearly 50 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. As a result of his legal prowess, Mr. Segal was tapped to serve as the chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar and president of the American Bar Association, becoming the first Jewish man to serve in either post. 
Mr. Segal continually dedicated himself to legal causes, and one of his most successful crusades was his mission to improve the selection process for federal judges. As chairman of the ABA's standing committee on the Federal Judiciary, Mr. Segal helped to persuade President Eisenhower to establish the practice of submitting prospective Federal judicial appointments to the ABA for review. In order to convince the President of the need for this procedure, Mr. Segal asked the former general this simple question: `Would you appoint a general without asking the colonels what they thought of him.' 
Bernard Segal's legal career was truly exemplary, but what made this man so extraordinary was his commitment to helping the less fortunate members of our society. Mr. Segal described the hallmark of the law firm that he helped found as its `dedication to the higher calling,' that is `the lawyer's obligation to assume an active role in the pursuit of a just and ordered society, in helping to solve the emerging problems of social, economic and political importance * * * to serve the public as his or her client, as she or he would serve a full-paying client.' 
Mr. Segal's commitment to preserving equal justice under the law for all Americans particularly shone during the civil rights movement. In the 1960's, many people in the country viewed civil rights as a Southern problem, one over which they had little influence or control. Fortunately, Bernard Segal did not share this view. 
In 1963, when Alabama Governor George Wallace announced that he would disregard the Federal court order that prohibited interference with the admission of African-American students at the University of Alabama, Bernard Segal saw the need for the Nation's legal community to speak out publicly against the Governor's actions. He quickly got 46 prominent lawyers, including three former U.S. Attorneys General, to sign a public letter condemning the Governor's defiance of the law. 
Shortly afterward, President Kennedy announced that he was creating a group known as the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and the President named Bernard Segal as one of the organization's two co-chairmen. This committee of 246 private lawyers helped build support for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and its call for peaceful compliance with court orders had a persuasive impact on future integration efforts in the South. 
In the wake of the civil rights movement, Bernard Segal remained socially active. President Johnson chose him to head the National Legal Service Program, which established legal services for the poor. And much like he did at his own law firm, Mr. Segal worked diligently to enlist lawyers to provide legal assistance for the indigent. 
Bernard Segal's efforts did not go unrecognized. Among his many honors were the American Bar Association's Gold Medal, the National Civil Rights Award by the U.S. Attorney General, the National Human Relations Award by the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Judge William H. Hastie Award by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the World Peace Through Law Award as the `World's Greatest Lawyer.' 
Bernard Segal represented the highest standards and ideals of the legal profession, and all those who were fortunate enough to know this great man will miss him dearly. He is survived by his wife, Geraldine, his daughter Loretta, his son Richard, three grandchildren, one great-grandchild, his brother, and his sister. I offer my heartfelt condolences to them all.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to Gen. John Shalikashvili. His life's story is one of the greatest in our Nation's history. General Shali, as he is affectionately known, came to this country when he was 16, and after graduating from college, he was drafted into the U.S. military. During his 39 years of public service, he rose from the ranks of Army private to the highest military office in the land. He is an embodiment of the principles for which this Nation stands, and I would like to pay tribute to him on the occasion of his retirement earlier this year as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Anyone he worked with will tell you that he did a tremendous job as Chairman. During these times of military downsizing, he has been responsible for shaping a military that is smaller, but better. In order to do so, he had to ensure that our troops were better prepared and better equipped than any other force in the world. He succeeded mightily. 
During his tenure as Chairman, U.S. troops were tested in more than 40 operations. In places like Bosnia, Haiti, and Iraq our troops performed superbly in their efforts to defend democracy and further the cause of peace. 
General Shalikashvili's courage and bravery were unquestioned, as evidenced by the Bronze Star he earned for his combat service in the Vietnam war. But what made General Shali such an effective leader was his compassion, and his ability to understand the human element of military operations. 
He was the head of the 1991 operation to provide relief to the Iraqi Kurds who had been exiled from their homes by Saddam Hussein. Thousands of men, women, and children were dying in the mountains of northern Iraq and eastern Turkey, and he helped many of these families return to their homes, personally providing comfort to these individuals who were sick and suffering. 
America's troops could look at General Shali and see a man who understood their needs, because he had stood in their shoes. He worked his way through the ranks, but never forgot his own past. 
General Shalikashvili spent his 39-year career fighting to protect freedom, and I think that the greatest tribute and reward for his service came this past July in the city of Warsaw. At that time, General Shali watched on as President Clinton invited Poland to become a member of NATO. Who would have ever imagined that the young Polish child, who was 3-years-old when Hitler's tanks rolled in from the East, would 1 day return to Poland as the highest-ranking officer of the U.S. military and stand before thousands of cheering Poles as his native country was welcomed back into the family of free nations? 
General Shalikashvili is truly an inspiration to us all, and our Nation is richer and stronger as a result of his contributions. I want to personally thank him for his service, and I wish him and his wife, Joan, all the best as they enjoy retirement together.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today in strong support for passage of S. 318, the Homeowners Protection Act of 1997. This important consumer legislation would end the odious practice of forcing hundreds of thousands of homeowners to pay for private mortgage insurance long after they, or their lender, cease to derive any benefit from it. 
Private mortgage insurance--or PMI as it's known--has played a very important role in expanding homeownership opportunities for people who have had less than the traditional 20 percent downpayment that many lenders required. In the event of a default, the PMI provides insurance to the lender for the difference between the downpayment and 20 percent or, in rare instances, some other predetermined percentage--equity level. This is also known as an 80 percent loan-to-value ratio. 
As beneficial as PMI has been, it has also developed some less savory characteristics. Principally, the problem with PMI as it exists today is that it is virtually impossible for a homeowner to stop making the premium payments, even after the PMI no longer provides any protection. As a result, literally hundreds of thousands of homeowners pay as much as $1,200 a year in unfair and unnecessary payments. 
Mr. President, this legislation would change all that in a fair and simple way. First, the bill provides simple and meaningful disclosure to the borrower at the time of the mortgage closing, so that the borrower understands when and how they can cancel their PMI. In fact, the borrower receives an amortization table that gives them a date certain when they may voluntarily cancel the PMI and a date certain when the PMI will be automatically canceled. Second, the bill requires the mortgage servicer to provide annual notices to the homeowner and then to let the homeowner know that they've reached 80 percent loan-to-value ratio, based upon the original amortization table, and therefore, the homeowner may have the right to cancel. Third, the bill provides that for the vast majority of homeowners, their PMI will be automatically canceled at 78 percent loan-to-value ratio, based upon the original amortization table. Lastly, there are some very, very narrow exceptions for high-risk loans that allow the continuation of PMI to the halflife of the loan. 
Let me put it more simply, Mr. President: for the overwhelming majority of homeowners, when you've got 20 percent equity in your home, you have the right to initiate cancellation of your PMI. If you choose not to initiate the cancellation, your PMI will be automatically canceled at 22 percent equity. It's that simple. And the result of these reforms will save hundreds of thousands of homeowners as much as $1,200 a year. 
As easy as the problem was to identify, it was a complicated and difficult process to achieve this legislative remedy. I particularly wish to acknowledge the outstanding work of Chairman D'Amato, with whom I joined in this effort back in February. I would also like to thank Senator Sarbanes, Senator Faircloth, and Senator Bennett for their tireless efforts to achieve a bill that serves the interest of consumers without inadvertently disrupting the mortgage lending industry. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for key provisions of the fiscal year 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill. 
This bill is the product of a long, often difficult, process and, like many of our legislative efforts, it is in no way perfect. However, I am particularly pleased with the $3.3 billion increase included for education. 
With this legislation, students, parents and schools across the country will see broad increases in Federal spending in key areas. Funding for education technology will double. Special education funding will increase by $800 million to a historic high of nearly $5 billion. The title I program, which provides disadvantaged students with remedial tutoring in math and science, will receive $7.4 billion. This bill also provides for the continued development of voluntary national tests in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math. While there was a great deal of negotiation, discussion, and compromise on this last issue, I am pleased that the final legislation does not set up any roadblocks that will block full implementation of this important accountability initiative in schools across the country. 
This bill also includes new funding for young children. Head Start funding will grow by $300 million, putting it on the path to serving 1,000,000 3- and 4-year-olds by the year 2000. The Child Care and Development Block Grant will also grow by $50 million to reach $1 billion and provide working families with additional assistance in meeting their child care needs. 
On the other end of education funding, college students and their parents will receive substantial new assistance through this bill. First and most importantly, the Pell grant program will receive an increase of $1.5 billion. These funds will increase the Pell grant maximum to $3,000--the highest level in history--and will expand the Pell grant program to assist an additional 210,000 students. 
This last step is particularly crucial in my view. Earlier this year, I introduced legislation to better assist students by modifying the treatment of dependent student income to ensure that needy students are not penalized for working. This appropriations bill includes this initiative and consequently will reach thousands of new students who work. This appropriations bill does not fully accomplish the goals set by my legislation, but it takes the first vital steps, which we can hopefully build upon during next year's reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. 
This bill also includes legislation approved by the Labor and Human Resources Committee last month to assist students in better managing their Federal student loans. This bill, the Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act, responds to the recent shutdown of the Federal direct loan consolidation programs by providing all student borrowers with the option of consolidating their student loans into the guaranteed loan program. There had been some concern that this bill, as it passed the Labor Committee, did not have an appropriate offset; however, additional clarifying language is included today which will allow the administration to manage this offset appropriately. We also include another emergency provision which ensures that families who receive a HOPE Scholarship will not be penalized for this scholarship in the determination of families' need for Federal student aid. It is very important to America's families and college students that these two initiatives pass this year and I am pleased that their inclusion in this bill today will make that possible. 
Thus far, Mr. President, I have focused on what is in this bill in terms of education. However, I am pleased that one education provision adopted by the Senate was dropped in this final bill--the Gorton amendment. This very destructive amendment, which I have strenuously opposed since it was first introduced, would have eliminated Federal funding for school safety, character education, vocational rehabilitation services, Indian education, teacher training and education technology. The conferees recognized that this policy was not fully considered by the Senate, as well as the appropriate committees, and took us in the wrong direction on education policy. 
For all that is good in this bill, it is clearly the product of considerable compromise and is not the bill I would have written. I am particularly disturbed by the inclusion of language expanding the reach of the Hyde amendment which will further limit the rights of Federal employees in this important, personal area. However, on the whole, I believe this is a good bill for the families and children of America and will join my colleagues in supporting its passage. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator Mack, Senator Harkin, and others in introducing the National Institutes of Health Trust Fund Act of 1997. This bill, very simply, is intended to ensure that payments made by the tobacco industry under any settlement legislation enacted by Congress on behalf of the people of this Nation, will be the full responsibility of the tobacco companies. 
Many of us were dismayed to learn that under current law, those payments could be deducted by these companies as a business expense--effectively reducing the cost to manufacturers by one-third. I don't think that this is what the negotiators of the settlement intended, nor is it what the public expects. This bill would disallow the deductibility of the proposed settlement or the settlement of any other tobacco-related civil action. The tax revenues from the disallowance of the deduction, estimated at $100 billion, would go toward a trust fund for the National Institutes of Health. 
My primary interest in the tobacco settlement originates in the dramatically high incidence of teen smoking in our country. The statistics are startling--3,000 young children begin smoking each day and over 90 percent of adults that smoke started before the age of 18. Our hope and expectation is that with resources generated by a tobacco settlement, we can fund effective programs to help addicted teens quit smoking and prevent most children from ever starting. 
In essence, we want to encourage young people to take responsibility for their health. Tobacco companies must set a precedent for our youth by taking full financial responsibility for the damage they have inflicted on the public health of the Nation. Tobacco companies have already conceded the points that tobacco is harmful and addictive and information that would have been useful to our understanding of tobacco addition was withheld. Avoiding full payment of penalties for their actions through the tax deduction loophole is ethically wrong, even if legal. The tobacco industry needs to serve as an example for the children of the Nation by accepting the full financial consequences of the settlement. 
Just a few months ago, the public loudly voiced its disgust with the covert attempt to give the tobacco industry a $50 billion credit toward payment of a future settlement. While we were successful in eliminating that loophole, an unfortunate repercussion has been the exacerbation of the public's doubts about the settlement. Even if they didn't before, many now believe that the industry will exploit any loophole to escape its responsibility. We must restore the public's faith in this process. We must send a clear message that any tobacco settlement reached will be grounded in the principle that tobacco companies take full responsibility for their actions. That objective can best be achieved by swift passage of this bill.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National Commission on Fairness in the Workplace Act. This commission will be tasked to review the trend of creating more part-time jobs than full-time jobs; assess the relationship between part-time work and wage levels, benefits, earning potential, and productivity; and examine the practice of having different wage and benefit levels for part-time and full-time workers. This commission, comprised of representatives of the business community, labor, academia and government, will report its findings and recommendations to Congress and the President. 
I fully recognize that for many individuals, part-time employment is a perfect solution. Full-time students and individuals wanting to combine work and family responsibilities choose to work part-time. But, part-time work should not be a passport to second class status. Often these employees perform the same duties as their full-time counterparts, but for less money and no benefits. And for those individuals seeking employment, too often they can only find work that requires full-time hours, but not full-time pay and benefits. 
Too many Americans are forced to work two and three part-time jobs to pay their rent or mortgage, and put food on their tables. Let's not forget that employees who work full-time, earning benefits and living wages, are often still struggling. How do we expect individuals and families to survive on part-time wages and no benefits. Their status may be classified as part-time, but their expenses certainly are not. 
Employers must strive to provide salaries and benefits that meet the demands of today's circumstances, while searching for ways to increase productivity and remain competitive in a global environment. 
The recent UPS experience put a national spotlight on this issue; working full-time hours at part-time status and receiving less money and fewer benefits than a full-time employee. One of the concessions of the negotiations was that UPS would agree to create 10,000 full-time jobs from existing part-time positions. 
A poll of 500 individuals by the University of Connecticut in September found strong support for action that would guarantee part-time workers some benefits and compel employers to pay those workers hourly wages equal to their full-time counterparts. Part-time employees in Connecticut comprise 12 percent of the work-force, less than the 18 percent national average. 
Our work-force is one of our countries most treasured assets. Employees deserve to receive living wages and benefits and we must act now. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Thurmond, Senator Levin, and the others on the Armed Services Committee for their efforts in bringing this conference report to the floor. This important conference report has not easily reached this point, and the fact that we are about to vote on it is a tribute to the bipartisanship and forbearance of the Committee members. 
This conference report will be good for our fighting forces and good for the Nation. Most important perhaps is the well-deserved 2.8 percent pay raise for our military personnel. Moreover, this conference report will provide the badly needed pay bonuses to help encourage highly trained personnel to continue their military service beyond their initial commitments. 
With passage of this conference report into law, this Nation will also fully fund the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program--the most cost-effective means of preventing nuclear proliferation. I can think of no better method to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction than to assist Russia in dismantling its nuclear arsenal. 
This conference report includes an amendment that I authored to assist those suffering from Persian Gulf war illnesses. Next year, I look forward to a combined Defense Department-Veterans Administration plan to provide health care to our sick veterans. Also, I expect to see a full report from the Defense Department on the effectiveness of research efforts to date. Finally, because there has not yet been a program to determine which treatments are most effective in caring for those suffering from Persian Gulf war illnesses, this amendment authorizes $4.5 million to begin a clinical trials program with that determination as its goal. 
As for procurement, I give this conference report high marks. It supports the agreement between our Nation's two submarine builders to work together in building the New Attack Submarine; it provides appropriate relief from the Seawolf cost cap; it completes the funding authorization for the third and final Seawolf-class submarine; and it fully funds the New Attack Submarine Program. For those who think that this Nation is doing too much submarine building, let me urge them not to look at any 1 year in particular, but to look at the submarine program as a whole. The U.S. Navy, which had once built two, three, or four attack submarines a year to maintain a fleet of well over 100, now plans to build just four over the next 6 years. The United States has never built nuclear attack submarines at a lower rate. 
This conference report also authorizes 30 H-60 helicopters. The Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and National Guard all use these helicopters, not to mention several countries throughout the world. In natural disasters and military operations alike, H-60 helicopters are on the front line. One need only ask the Adjutant General of virtually any State in the Union to gain an appreciation of how vitally important these helicopters are. I hope that future defense bills will continue to provide this Nation's servicemembers with the capable H-60 helicopters that they need and want. 
Let me conclude by mentioning that I do not know whether this conference report will be vetoed. I think, on balance, that the good in this report clearly outweighs the bad, and I would urge the President to quickly make it law rather than prolonging the battles that have plagued conference report for months.

Mr. DODD. 
Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues, Senators Warner, Bennett, Jeffords, Grams, Bingaman, and Leahy in introducing the Cuban Women and Children Humanitarian Relief Act--a bill to authorize the President to permit the sale of food, medicine, and medical equipment to the Cuban people. 
Provisions of this bill include a summary of the impact that the United States embargo on food and medicine has had on the public health in Cuba; a statement of United States policy with respect to the sale of food and medicine; authority for the President to permit the sale of food, medicine, and medical supplies to Cuba; congressional notification requirements; and a report to Congress assessing the impact of the bill 2 years after enactment. 
Mr. President, the intent of the legislation is very straight forward, namely to clear away all of the legal implements that impede the President's ability to permit American exports of food, medicines, and medical supplies to Cuba. As a matter of policy, I do not believe that United States sanctions should include prohibitions on the sale of what are essentially humanitarian items--products that are critical to the health and well being of the more than 10 million people who inhabit the Island of Cuba. 
Most Americans are probably unaware that United States policy generally prohibits American food and drug companies from selling food, medicines, and medical supplies to Cuba. Even those who are aware of this aspect of United States policy, probably assume that this isn't a serious problem, since Cuban authorities can simply buy these products elsewhere. That is not the case. 
Earlier this year, the American Association for World Health [AAWH] issued a report--Denial of Food and Medicine: The Impact of the U.S. Embargo on Health & Nutrition in Cuba--setting forth its observations from a year long study of the implications of the United States embargo on health care delivery and food security in Cuba. The AAWH `determined that the United States embargo of Cuba has dramatically harmed the health and nutrition of large numbers of ordinary Cuban citizens.' The team of nine medical experts who undertook this effort on behalf of AAWH identified four major health problems affected by the embargo: malnutrition, water quality, medicines and equipment, and medical information. 
First, with respect to malnutrition--the prohibition on the sale of United States food to Cuba has had serious consequences on the nutritional standards in Cuba, particularly for pregnant women. These nutritional deficiencies have, among other things, led to an increased incidence of low birth-weight babies. 
With respect to water quality, the lack of parts and appropriate chemicals has compromised the Cuban water supply system and resulted in increased illness and deaths from water-borne diseases. 
We all know that United States medical and pharmaceutical companies are at the forefront of the development and production of a vast majority of all new drugs and medical equipment that enter world markets. The by-product of that situation is that current United States restrictions virtually preclude the Cuban medical system from utilizing the most effective and advanced medicines and medical treatments in caring for the Cuban people. Finally, the embargo indirectly inhibits the exchange of critical medical information between the United States and Cuba. 
In no way should this legislation be seen as an endorsement of the current regime in Cuba. The existing policies of that government are clearly responsible for the serious economic crisis confronting that country. United States policy should be focused on promoting a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba--the tide of history flows in that direction. 
Many human rights activists within Cuba have been strongly critical of United States food and medicine restrictions. Elizardo Sanchez Santacruz, director of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, and a prominent critic of the Cuban Government, has made clear his views on the current policy. `America should lift its embargo on the sales of food and medicine to Cuba, a prohibition that violates international law and hurts the people, not the regime. Denying medicine to innocent citizens is an odd way of demonstrating support for human rights.' 
I share that view. I believe the Clinton administration should take steps to mitigate the harmful impact of United States policy on the health of the Cuban people--particularly so with respect to the health of children, the elderly, and the infirm--by permitting United States exporters to sell food and medicine to that country. That is what this bill once enacted will enable the President to do.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know we have a vote at about 11 o'clock and my colleague from Georgia wants to be heard before that time. I will try and move this along. 
Mr. President, the vote around 11 o'clock is on a cloture motion dealing with a proposal that has been offered by my colleague from Georgia, whom I respect greatly and agree with on many issues. On this one we disagree, not because of his intent at all, but rather because I am concerned it is not the best use of scarce resources. Even though our budget situation is vastly improved from what it was even a few months ago--with the deficit now down around to unimaginably low levels--still we must make careful decisions about how to best invest those dollars. 
When you are trying to help out working parents with the costs of raising children, the question becomes one of priorities in allocating resources. As I understand it, if the cloture motion that will be offered shortly were to be agreed to, an amendment that I would like to offer would be foreclosed because it would probably not pass the procedural test of being germane. I am concerned about that, and for that reason will oppose the cloture motion. 
The amendment I would offer, Mr. President, would propose a substitute to what our colleague from Georgia has offered. My proposal would allow for a refundable tax credit for child care. As it is right now, we have some 2 million American families--working families; not on welfare, but working--who don't have any tax liability at all and, therefore, cannot claim the current child care tax credit. 
The affordability and quality of child care, Mr. President, is an area in which most Americans are developing a growing sense of concern. The recent tragedy in Massachusetts that we have all been witness to over the last several days, highlights the concerns that millions and millions of American families have today about who will care for their children and whether they can afford to place them in a quality environment. 
In contrast, when we are talking about education, choices do exist for parents. There are 53 million American children who are in our elementary and secondary schools at this very hour. About 90 percent of them are in public schools, about 10 percent in private and parochial schools. There is a choice, Mr. President. Parents have a choice. Now, it is expensive in some private and parochial schools, but the choice of free public schooling is there. It is not a great choice in many areas because of the condition of our public schools, but at least affordability is not an issue. 
When it comes to child care, Mr. President, there really are not many choices available to parents. If you are coming off welfare, if you are working, you have to place your children someplace. The issues of quality and accessibility are obviously important, but if you can't afford it at all, if you can't afford the $4,000 to the $9,000 a year that it costs to place your child in a child care setting, you have no choices. 
Today, when we have working families out there that are barely making it and we have about $2 billion in tax credits we can offer, I ask the question of my colleagues of whether we can't do something to help. While we might like to do everything for everyone if we could, given the choice of providing a tax credit to someone making $85,000 a year to send their child to a private school or saying to a working family that is barely making it, here are some resources that will allow you to place your child while you work in a decent child care setting, what choice do we make? Do we provide a tax break, with all due respect, to people who have a choice? Or do we offer a refundable tax credit of roughly the 
same cost as Senator Coverdell's amendment to working families, struggling to hold body and soul together--people who have no choices. 
Mr. President, the other day there was an article in the Hartford Courant about a woman who has three children, making $6.50 an hour. She has a small apartment and a 1981 automobile. Now she is about to leave welfare. She will lose her welfare benefits of $500 or $600 a month. That ends this week. Now, at $6.50 an hour, with three kids, trying to keep an apartment, trying to keep her family going, I would like to say to her I can't do everything for you with regard to your children as you go to work. But I would at least like to say that I can offer you a refundable tax credit--because at $6.50 an hour you are not paying taxes--and give you a break to see that your three children can be in a child care setting where they may be safe. 
The question is, do I try to help her? Or, with all due respect, do I instead help someone making--$50,000, $60,000, or $70,000 a year to go to a private school in Washington, Maryland or Virginia? Those are the kind of choices we have to make. 
I argue very strongly that when you have limited resources, let's put them to work for people who are struggling out there, who need the help the most. Because I can't offer an amendment that I think would make the right choice if cloture were adopted, with all due respect to the authors of the amendment, I will oppose cloture. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would help our communities respond to an increasingly serious problem in our country: truancy. Truancy is a dangerous and growing trend in our nation's schools. It not only prevents our children from receiving the education they need, but it is often the first warning of more serious problems to come. Truant students are at greater risk of falling into substance abuse, gangs, and violent behavior. Truancy is a gateway into all of these activities. 
In the past ten years, truancy has increased by 67 percent. In 1994, courts formally processed 36,400 truancy cases. And in some inner city schools, absentee rates approach 50 percent. Fortunately, truancy is a solvable problem. Many communities have begun to set up early intervention programs--to reach out and prevent truancy before it leads to delinquency and criminal behavior. These programs are showing signs of success, as several towns have reported drops in daytime burglary rates of as much as 75 percent after instituting truancy prevention initiatives. 
Unfortunately, implementing these programs has been a challenge. Truancy is considered an educational rather than a criminal issue, and, with growing classroom enrollments, many financially-strapped schools don't have the resources to adequately address this problem. 
Today, I am introducing `The Prevention of Truancy [PTA] Act of 1997' whose goal is to promote anti-truancy partnerships between schools, parents, law enforcement agencies, and social service and youth organizations. This bill would provide $80 million in grant funding for the purpose of developing, implementing, or operating partnerships for the prevention and reduction of truancy. The partnerships would be administered by the Department of Education. 
All of the partnership programs would be required to sanction students engaging in truancy, as well as provide incentives for parents to take responsibility for their children. These programs would also be evaluated for their effectiveness in preventing truancy, increasing school attendance, and reducing juvenile crime. 
Truancy prevention programs produce long-term savings. By some estimates, truants cost this nation more than $240 billion in lost earnings and foregone taxes over their lifetimes. And billions more are spent on law enforcement, prisons, welfare, health care, and other social services for these individuals. Imagine what we could do with this money if we could keep our kids in school? Imagine how bright their futures could be? I hope my legislation will help communities build successful programs to prevent and reduce truancy so that one day we will realize these concrete savings and admire the accomplishments of the youth who benefitted from these programs.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Charles Rossotti's nomination to serve as Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS is an agency under widespread, deeply felt, and entirely justified criticism. In my view, the nomination before us today is perhaps one of the most critical the Senate will vote on this session. I commend President Clinton for endorsing an individual who has the expertise and vision to lead the effort to restructure and reform this troubled agency, as well as my colleagues on the Finance Committee for moving the nomination expeditiously. 
It is no secret that the IRS has come under fire lately from taxpayers who, in their dealings with the agency, have experienced anger, frustration, and despair. The hearings conducted by the Finance Committee earlier this fall highlighted some of the problems at the IRS, including shoddy management, poor taxpayer service, and in some cases, reports of taxpayer abuse by IRS employees. 
I've heard stories from my own constituents about calls that aren't answered, and about calls that are bounced from one person to the next, where they never get a real answer or any type of guidance or support. I've also heard stories about the IRS losing people's checks and then charging them interest and penalties on this money. The list goes on and on, Mr. President, and the more people you talk to, the more nightmares you hear. 
Every citizen who pays taxes has a right to be treated fairly, and treated as innocent until proven guilty. Although we have taken several steps in this regard in the last few years, there is still more that can be done, and that is why I am a cosponsor of S. 1096, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act. 
This legislation aims to transform the troubled agency into a modern institution that provides efficient and fair service, yet still has the ability to effectively collect revenues. Specifically, the bill will enact 21 new taxpayer protections and will establish a hotline for taxpayers to register complaints of IRS misconduct. This legislation, which enjoys broad, bipartisan support and is endorsed by the administration, is, in my view, a tremendous step forward in our effort to protect the rights of our nation's taxpayers. 
Yet, without an effective leader to implement these much-needed changes, our ideas become nothing but good intentions. I believe that Mr. Rossotti is up to the challenge to successfully steer the IRS through this difficult period. Mr. Rossotti brings with him the refreshing ideas and outlook of a successful businessman with more than 30 years of management and technology experience, including his current position as Chairman of American Management Systems. 
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Rossotti expressed a willingness and desire to implement fundamental changes that would focus on the rights of the taxpayer, modernize the agency and its technology, and strengthen communication between Congress, the IRS, and the public. In my view, Mr. Rossotti has the vision and the capability to lead this agency and is committed to holding the IRS to the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and accountability. I urge my colleagues to support this nomination.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I am pleased to join with my fellow colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, in introducing this bill which would designate the U.S. courthouse in New Haven, CT, as the `Richard C. Lee United States Courthouse.' I strongly believe that this designation would be a fitting tribute to Dick Lee's service and commitment to the city of New Haven, and I commend my good friend and colleague for putting this legislation forward. 
A self-educated man who was legendary for his charm, Dick Lee is widely considered as one of the most forceful, most capable, and most dedicated mayors that the State of Connecticut an this country has ever known. 
After losing two bids to become mayor, Dick Lee went on to win eight straight elections, serving as the mayor of New Haven from 1954 to 1969. His first two elections were very close, losing by only two votes in his 1951. Dick Lee learned from these narrow defeats, and they helped to shape his political career. He realized that every single person mattered, and he always did everything in his power to help his constituents, particularly those who were in need. He was always eager to tackle, rather than turn away from constituents' problems. He also exhibited great foresight in anticipating the problems that awaited New Haven and other cities, and he offered imaginative and progressive solutions to these concerns. 
The focus of his ideas was to preserve and rehabilitate neighborhoods, and to engage in urban planning done with the community, not for it. He supervised the clearance of slums in New Haven and revitalized once decaying areas by rebuilding businesses and homes. He oversaw the building of two new public high schools and a dozen elementary schools. To ensure that residents would have a greater investment in their communities, he pushed for the building of housing that low-income families could buy rather than rent. And Hew Haven was also the first major U.S. city to create its own antipoverty program. 
Many viewed Dick Lee's views as ahead of his time, and he quickly established a national reputation as a visionary of urban revitalization. On the strength of this reputation, Mr. Lee became a respected advisor to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson on matters of urban policy. 
Mr. Lee was approached about a possible cabinet position, but rather than lobby for a political appointment for himself, he used his political capital to help secure Federal funding for his urban redevelopment initiatives back home in New Haven. At one point during Dick Lee's tenure, New Haven was receiving more Federal money per capita than any other city in the country. 
Dick Lee still lives in New Haven in the same house that he purchased more than 30 years ago. In light of all the work that Dick Lee did for the people of his home town and his effective advocacy on behalf of all of America's cities, I think that it is only appropriate that one of New Haven's Federal buildings should bear his name. Therefore I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill to designate the Federal courthouse in New Haven as the `Richard C. Lee United States Courthouse.'

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senator Lieberman legislation to waive the 1920 Merchant Marine Act, commonly known as the Jones Act, to allow Cross Sound Ferry Services, Inc., to purchase, rebuild, and operate the 1964 Canadian-built vessel Prince Nova. Faced with an increased demand for its services and a shortage of suitable U.S.-built ferries, Cross Sound cannot purchase a domestically built vessel. 
Cross Sound Ferry Services, a family owned, nonsubsidized operation, provides auto, truck, and high speed passenger service between Orient Point, NY, and New London, CT. According to the proposed waiver, Cross Sound will purchase the Prince Nova, and spend more than three times the purchase price, no less than $4.2 million, on the conversion, restoration, repair, rebuilding, or retrofitting of the ferry in a shipyard located in New London. 
Cross Sound Ferry Service, a vital link between New England and eastern Long Island, provides an alternative mode of transportation that saves trucks and autos up to 200 miles in each direction, and reduces traffic, congestion, and wear on major roadways. From an environmental standpoint, ferry service reduces fuel consumption and pollution. Currently, the I-95 corridor throughout the Northeast is under a tremendous traffic burden. If the waiver is granted, it is expected that the new and expanded service the Prince Nova will provide will save 6 million miles and 360,000 travel hours. 
Cross Sound's commitment to service the Prince Nova in a United States shipyard will create high-skilled, high-wage jobs. Additionally, this waiver will undoubtably better facilitate commerce and encourage economic development in the region by allowing consumers easier access to goods and services. Furthermore, it will provide businesses with an additional mode to transport their products. 
An identical waiver was passed last week in the House of Representatives as part of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1997. It is our hope that it will receive the same favorable consideration in the Senate.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is my intention to vote in favor of the Conference Report making appropriations for the Department of the Interior and related agencies, but I do so with some reservations. I commend the appropriations conferees for negotiating a multitude of very contentious issues, but I am particularly concerned with several anti-environmental provisions that remain in the report. 
The Balanced Budget agreement provided $700 million above the President's request for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and I am very pleased that the appropriators were able to honor that agreement. Land and water conservation funds and the matching State grant program have been very important to Connecticut's ability to acquire land and enhance recreation areas and parks. Without this funding, local communities will continue without the assistance they so deserve to acquire open space and further develop recreational areas. Unfortunately, Senate language providing $100 million in grants to States for land acquisition was not included in the conference report. 
A portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund will be used to purchase the Headwaters region in California and the New World Mine in Montana, subject to authorizing conditions. Although I recognize that the State of Montana will feel some adverse economic repercussion from the New World Mine purchase, I am dismayed that a proposal of $10 million to the State of Montana could be counted against the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
When the Senate initially debated the Interior appropriations bill, I was pleased to join many of my colleagues in voting for an amendment to eliminate funding for timber road purchaser credits for timber sales, but the amendment failed by the narrowest of margins. There is growing support for the elimination of all taxpayer subsidies for Forest Service logging road construction, and the House included language restricting the amount of timber purchaser credits. Unfortunately, the conferees dropped the House provision. 
Finally, the provision reducing the effectiveness of the law pertaining to the export of Federal timber benefits a few large timber companies in the West. It was never suitably discussed by the authorizing committee. 
While these are a few of my concerns, there are many provisions in the bill which merit my support. The Silvio Conte refuge and the Stewart McKinney refuge in my State received much-needed funding for land acquisition. Congress authorized the expansion of the McKinney refuge in 1990, and in the ensuing years, Federal appropriations have enabled the refuge to acquire 413 of the 454 acres available. Because the budget for the National Park Service was sufficiently funded, Weir Farm, the only national park in Connecticut, should receive an increase in its operating budget to meet its rising visitor service demands. 
Mr. President, as you know, I am a strong backer of the arts and I am pleased that the appropriators provided $98 million for the National Endowment of the Arts. The NEA was a marked agency, identified by the other body for elimination. In fact, the other body voted to zero out all funding and tried to extinguish the NEA. But together with my colleagues in the Senate, another round of efforts to dismantle or eliminate the NEA was stopped. When the bill came out of conference with the House, the NEA had been saved. As evidenced by a series of strong bipartisan votes in the Senate in favor of the NEA, my colleagues and I were able to save this national agency and preserve a Federal role for the arts. 
During the Senate debate over NEA funding, I cosponsored with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens from Alaska, a Sense-of-the-Senate resolution asking the Congress to examine alternative sources of funding for the NEA. I believe it is time to give the NEA a secure future and preserve a national cultural endowment for generations to come. My hope is that the Congress will address this issue in the future. 
And so it is for these reasons that I support the Interior appropriations conference report. I commend the conferees on a job well done.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on October 16, our colleague, Senator Joe Biden gave a very important and insightful assessment of United States foreign policy with respect to Bosnia. The occasion for those remarks was that Senator Biden was being honored by Fairleigh Dickinson University by being chosen as the first individual to hold a newly established chair at the university--the Fatemi University Chair in International Studies. 
In accepting this honor, Senator Biden focused his remarks on a current and some what daunting foreign policy challenge that looms before us in the coming months--Bosnia. As is always the case, Joe gave his candid and unvarnished assessment of the current situation in Bosnia--what's gone right and what's gone wrong. He also sets forth how he believes U.S. policy should evolve over the coming months, if the United States is to enhance the prospects for fostering peace and stability in that war-torn country and in maintaining its leadership in shaping the course of world events. His comments were very thoughtful and very much on target from my point of view. 
Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to take a moment to read Senator Biden's remarks. It would be time well spent.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Jane Alexander on her tenure as Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts. Just a few days ago, she announced her resignation from the NEA and her plan to return to private life. I am truly saddened that the NEA will lose such a strong and respected leader and that the Nation will lose one of its most articulate and effective champions in the effort to preserve the NEA. 
I am proud to be a strong supporter of the arts. It is clear that future generations will remember us not for our gross national product or our stockpile of advanced weapons, but for the content of the artistic and cultural expression that characterizes our civilization. The arts give us an opportunity to leave our mark on history. 
Jane Alexander's tenure has not been easy. Her term has spanned four of the most challenging years in the NEA's history, filled with annual fights over its survival. Each year we have seen assaults mounted on the arts and the NEA in particular. But the supporters of the arts in the Congress have met each of these challenges and emerged victorious thanks to the leadership of Jane Alexander. 
Perhaps as important as her leadership in these legislative battles has been her efforts throughout the country as an articulate voice in support of the arts and a Federal role in supporting the arts. She has visited schools and community centers as well as theaters and galleries across the country and has reminded Americans of the strength and importance of the arts. 
Beyond these efforts on the national scene, she has proved an able and adept manager of the NEA. She has implemented the mandated staff cuts at the NEA and restructured the agency without compromising its mission. She has compensated for fewer resources by forming partnerships with other agencies and encouraging all arts organizations to work more closely together. In addition, under her leadership, grant-making processes have been reorganized, accountability measures have been put in place, investments in arts education have increased, and new communication tools including a website have been developed. 
From the stage and the big screen to the halls of Congress, Jane Alexander has proven she is a remarkable individual, a great voice for the arts in America, and a true national treasure. I thank her for her dedication and her tireless efforts, and I wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the campaign finance reform legislation sponsored by Senators McCain and Feingold. 
The McCain/Feingold bill is a beginning, and is an important step towards reforming how we finance campaigns. It ends soft money contributions to national parties, expands disclosure requirements, and strengthens election law. It puts guidelines on hard money contributions and begins to address the problem of so-called `issue advocacy' advertisements that may be designed to persuade the public about a candidate instead of educating the public about an issue. It also requires labor unions to notify non-union members that they are entitled to request a refund of the portion their agency fees used for political purposes. Make no mistake about it--one bill cannot end the spiraling cost of campaigns or stop the coercive influence of money in our government. But it is a beginning. 
I am more convinced than ever that our current approach to funding political campaigns is broken and desperately in need of repair. My good friend, Senator Ford from Kentucky, cited the great cost of campaigns and the immense time needed to raise money as the reason for his retirement from the United States Senate. He explained that to run for re-election in 1998, he would need to spend the next two years raising $100,000 per week. Today, a run for the Senate may require over $5 million. On average, a Senator needs to raise $16,000 per week during their six year term to accumulate the funds needed to run a credible campaign. 
Not only are distinguished elected officials leaving public service due to the daunting cost of running for office, but many Americans have decided not to seek office because it simply costs too much money. This robs us of leaders with new ideas and diverse backgrounds, and it threatens to undermine our country's participatory democracy. 
Our democracy rests upon the fundamental principle that every person's vote is equal. A citizen walks into a voting booth, casts his or her vote, and the majority rules. But only fifty percent of Americans vote and only four percent of the population contribute to campaigns. 
The American people worry that those who wrote the checks now expect to write the laws. They see powerful lobbyists working to turn back the clock on 25 years of environmental protection, and to unravel laws that keep our workplaces safe and protect the food we eat. This appearance of undue influence supports the public's cynicism. 
Incredibly, those who defend politics as usual are not concerned about the amount of money in our political process. These leaders insist that the political process is fine, even though a record $765 million was consumed on House and Senate campaigns in 1996. In fact, Speaker Gingrich and other leaders in his party complain that too little, not too much, money is spent today on political campaigns. 
We all know that the Government Affairs Committee is, even as we speak, holding extensive hearings on the campaign finance practices of the last Presidential election. Yet, as we have seen here on the floor this week, the Majority Leader and most of those in his party would do nothing. However, there are a few Republicans, including one of the leaders on this issue Senator McCain, who have voted the responsible way and I commend them. It is now time to come together in a bipartisan manner and focus on the future of elections in America for all Americans. 
Since I was elected to Congress as part of `Class of 1974,' I have consistently fought for campaign finance reform. Since 1985, I have cosponsored seven campaign finance reform bills to remove the influence of money in elections and bring democracy back to the people of this country. In an attempt to curb the threatening influence of money, I have supported prohibitions in `soft money' in federal elections, and as the General Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, I challenged my counterparts to do the same. In another effort to limited the influence of money, I have supported caps on PAC contributions to candidates and limits on the total amount Senate candidates can accept from PACs. To level the playing field, and help challengers gain exposure, I have agreed to proposals for free or reduced response advertisement costs for candidates attacked by independent expenditures. I have supported requirements that Senate candidates raise most of their money from their home states in an attempt to bring elections back home to the people. Finally, I voted for a Constitutional amendment allowing Congress to set campaign spending limits. I know many of my fellow colleagues share my commitment to reform. 
As we debate reform, I am concerned that we stand behind the Federal Election Commission, which is charged with monitoring and watching campaign finance violations. The FEC must have the finances and resources it needs to promptly and effectively enforce the laws 
that govern our campaigns. Between 1994 and November 1996, the FEC's caseload rose 36 percent, and because complaints related to the 1996 election are still being filed, the FEC expects the caseload to ultimately rise by 52 percent. Of the 262 complaints filed with the FEC in the latest election cycle, only 88 are currently under active review. 
To address the effectiveness of the FEC, earlier this year I authored the FEC Improvement Act. I am pleased that most of the proposals from my bill--including electronic filing, authorizing the FEC to conduct random audits, and stiffer penalties--have been incorporated into the McCain/Feingold legislation. 
Time after time, Congress has talked about reform but in the end done nothing. Over the past 10 years, Congress has produced over 6,742 pages of hearings, members have made over 3,361 speeches, committees have produced more than 1,063 pages of reports, the Senate has recorded over 113 votes and formed one bipartisan commission. Yet in the end, it's just been business as usual, while the voice of the average American in our democratic process grows fainter, quality candidates say no to public service, and our democracy withers. 
I regret that the Senate this week has again missed an opportunity to pass comprehensive reform. The Senate missed another opportunity even though 53 Senators voted to fully consider the bill. I am saddened that the majority leader, along with the majority of his Republican colleagues, deployed procedural tactics that thwarted real reform. I lament this maneuver. 
It saddens me that the Republicans have chosen to sabotage this bipartisan bill. It saddens me even more that this procedural sabotage occurred after concerted efforts to accommodate Republican concerns. Important provisions including voluntary spending limits, free or discounted television and advertising time, and curbs on contributions to PAC's have all been modified in the spirit of bipartisanship. However, the Senate now may not even have a clean vote on campaign finance reform legislation this session. 
I have voted against Senator Lott's amendment because it was not a bipartisan effort. The Lott amendment was a partisan maneuver to end efforts for comprehensive campaign finance reform. I will continue to vote against any amendments that lack solid bipartisan support and harm a constructive effort for real reform. Conversely, I will consider supporting any amendments to the current legislation that have bipartisan support and would improve this bill. I will also continue to support any positive efforts by both sides to have campaign finance reform considered by the Senate for a full and complete debate this session. 
I call on all my colleagues to chart a new course, to put aside our differences, and to put first and foremost in our deliberations the good of the Nation. As leaders, we must not shirk our responsibility to do all we can to the reform campaign finance system. The McCain-Feingold bill begins that process, and I believe that as a body we have a solemn responsibility to embrace this legislation.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, America's greatest asset is its people, and what makes the American population unlike any other country's is our diversity. No other nation draws strength from so many different cultures, and the American population is a mosaic of the world's many nationalities. Through time, the traditions from these many nations have become part of our own society, enriching our national culture. But our Nation would not be nearly as strong without the contributions of Americans who are of Hispanic descent. In recognition of these contributions, our Nation is currently celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. 
Hispanic Heritage Month provides a wonderful opportunity for us to honor the diverse achievements and contributions of Hispanics in this country. I know that in my home State of Connecticut there have been parades and dances to mark this occasion, as well as readings of works by Hispanic authors at public libraries. All of these events give Hispanic-Americans a deeper appreciation for their roots, and make all Americans more aware of the contributions that Hispanics make to our Nation. 
Perhaps the easiest way to understand and appreciate the extent to which Hispanics have become entwined in the American landscape would come from reading the newspaper. On the front page, you could read an article about our Secretary of Energy or the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations who are both Hispanic. In the business section you could read an article on the Latino Administrator of the Small Business Administration who released a report showing that the number of new businesses owned by Hispanic women has grown at three times the overall rate of business growth. In the arts section you could read about a recital by a Spanish guitarist playing flamenco music at a local theater. The food section could have an writeup of a new Mexican restaurant that just opened up downtown. And in the Sports section you could read about the Major League Baseball playoffs where every single team has Hispanic players that are responsible for their team's success. In fact, in the Washington Post sports pages you could read coverage of World Cup Soccer, in Spanish. 
When we talk about Hispanics and how their contributions make our Nation more vibrant and diverse, it is important that we recognize the great diversity that exists within the Hispanic community itself. Hispanic-Americans come from a variety of nations, ranging from Central America to South America to Europe to the Caribbean. 
What unites Hispanic-Americans is a fundamental respect for the traditions and values of their native lands combined with a strong commitment to the American dream. Life in America requires that they strike a balance between embracing their roots and assimilating into this new culture. Reaching this balance can be a struggle, but it is a struggle that will leave them enriched as individuals, while at the same time enriching our Nation. 
Hispanic-Americans should take great pride in their heritage, and I am glad that Hispanic Heritage Month gives our Nation an opportunity to honor and celebrate their contributions.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am very pleased this afternoon to rise along with my colleague, Senator Gramm of Texas, who spoke a few moments ago, on a bill that the two of us are introducing together. I regret that I wasn't on the floor at the time he made his remarks. But I appreciate very much his leadership on this issue. 
We are introducing a bill called the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997. 
Just about 2 years ago, I stood here as part of a successful effort to restore the integrity and fairness of our private securities litigation system. 
It's probably appropriate at this juncture to remind ourselves just how important the private litigation system has been in maintaining the integrity of our capital markets. 
It is highly questionable whether our markets would be as deep, as liquid, as strong, as transparent, were it not for our system of maintaining private rights of action against those who commit fraud. 
It is precisely because of the importance of this system, that the depths to which it had sunk by 1995 was so very troubling. 
The system was no longer a mechanism for aggrieved investors to seek justice and restitution, but was instead a means for enterprising attorneys to manipulate its procedures for their own considerable profit and to the detriment of legitimate companies and investors across the Nation. 
I could easily spend all of my time today recounting the cases of abusive and frivolous litigation that were hindering our growth industries; suffice to say that the flaws in the litigation system not only threatened the viability of private rights of action, but also presented a serious threat to the growth and success of key industries across the Nation. 
Now that we are 2 years out from enactment of the reform bill, it is easy to see that many of the reforms are working well and that aggrieved investors still have access to the courthouse. 
However, there is one development since the enactment of the reform law that has the potential to undermine our good work and send us back to the days of litigation frenzy. 
This development is the significant increase in securities fraud class actions filed in State court. 
Prior to congressional enactment of the reform law in 1995, securities fraud class actions in State court were almost unheard of. People went to the Federal courts. 
But since we reformed the Federal system, there has been substantial increases in State court filings both in 1996 and 1997. 
It is not unreasonable to assume that it is the weaker, even abusive claims, that are now finding a home in State court that they no longer have in Federal court. 
The development of differing standards in State courts is troubling not only to this Senator, but also to the President. In a letter the President sent to me on this subject in July, he stated: 
The possibility of change in one or more States' securities laws similar to those proposed [last year] in California's Proposition 211 suggests that there may be a need to reconsider the appropriate balance of Federal and State roles in securities law. As I said when I opposed Proposition 211 last August, the proliferation of multiple and inconsistent standards could undermine national law. 
In April, the Securities and Exchange Commission conducted a survey for the President, on the effect of the reform act; one of the survey's conclusions was: 
To the extent that State courts can be used to avoid the discovery stay in cases that would otherwise have been brought in Federal court, one of the goals of the reform act may be frustrated. 
This migration of frivolous class actions to State court threatens the effectiveness of the reform act. 
Not only is it reasonable to assume that more and more companies could become hostage to increased State litigation costs, but the prospect of State litigation, where there is no safe harbor for forward-looking statements, is right now having a chilling effect upon corporate disclosure of projections and other forward-looking information. 
Let me just as an aside state how important it is for prospective investors to get as much disclosure from companies as they possibly can so that they can make intelligent decisions about whether to invest their hard-earned dollars in these companies. Mr. President, this is a question of getting as much information, as I said, from companies. What we had in the Federal law was, of course, a safe harbor to allow for statements to be made that could then not be used against the corporation in some frivolous lawsuit. 
Now, reasonable people, of course, may disagree with the magnitude of the State litigation problem as it exists today. I would be first to admit that as well. I do not want to suggest to my colleagues that we have some overwhelming problem on our hands. 
But whether you believe that it is a small, medium, or even large problem today, as some do, it is a less important question, in my view, than whether you believe it is a problem that is destined to get worse. I think on that everyone can agree. 
Again, I think the Securities and Exchange Commission survey is instructive on this point. I quote from the report. 
. . . if State law provides advantages to plaintiffs in particular case, it is reasonable to expect that plaintiffs' counsel will file suit in State court. 
The plain English translation: any plaintiffs' attorney worth his salt is going to file in State court if he feels it will give him an advantage.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am again introducing the Construction Safety, Health, and Education Improvement Act of 1997. In 1970, the passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act signified a pledge to American workers that workplaces would be safe and healthy. Sadly, 27 years later, we still have a long way to go to fulfill that promise. 
Nationally, more than 6,200 people died from work-related injuries in 1995, as average of 17 people each day. More than 1,000 of those deaths were in the construction industry. In Connecticut, construction deaths remain a significant fact of life for men and women who work in this field. But these are not simply statistics. These deaths represent families and friends losing loved ones. 
Construction tends to involve some of the most hazardous work done by workers including roofing, excavation, and trenching. The industry faces many challenges in providing a safe work environment. Often, the worksite changes from week to week, or day to day, and workers and subcontractors come and go as a given project moves forward. 
I will never forget the tragedy that occurred at a construction site in my home State more 10 years ago. Twenty-eight people lost their lives during the construction of an apartment building called L'Ambiance Plaza in Bridgeport, CT, when the floors of the building collapsed. Ten years have not healed the wounds from that tragedy. I attended a memorial service earlier this year, and saw many of the same people I saw 10 years ago when this tragedy occurred. They were older, but still carry grief over the loss of a spouse, parent, or friend. 
Construction disasters are sadly not isolated to a given State or region. In just the last few months, construction workers in Orlando, Chicago, Indianapolis, Brooklyn, Huntington Beach, and Washington, DC, to name just a few, lost their lives in work related accidents. 
The bill I am offering today is straightforward and offers commonsense solutions. I introduced similar legislation in each of the past five Congresses. An office of construction, safety, health and education would be established within OSHA tasked to identify construction employees with a high incidence of injury and noncompliance. The office would establish training in construction safety for inspectors, establish model compliance programs and a toll-free number for reporting safety concerns. The bill would require the development and implementation of a written safety and health plan for each construction project, including an analysis of hazardous activities involved in the project and assurances that all employees are notified of these conditions. 
Whether 1 person dies or 25 die, any life lost is one too many. We should not suffer another workplace tragedy before we put in place measures to safeguard construction sites. I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this bill.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to this amendment. 
Few issues are as divisive in education as this one--private school vouchers. There are very strong feelings on both sides of this issue. This is as it should be on issues affecting our children--strong feelings should be the norm. But I believe we should be concerned for all children, not just for a few. 
Our universal system of public education is one of the very cornerstones of our Nation, our democracy and our culture. 
In every community, public schools are where America comes together in its rich diversity. For generations, educating the rich, poor, black, white, first-generation Americans--be they Irish, English, Japanese or Mexican-Americans--and all Americans has been the charge and challenge of our public schools. It is clearly not the easiest task. But it's importance cannot be undervalued. 
These efforts are essential to our democracy which relies on an educated citizenry, to our communities which require understanding of diversity to function, and to our economy which thrives on highly educated and trained worker. Education--public education--is also the door to economic opportunity for all citizens individually. 
However, voucher proposals, like the one before us today, fundamentally undermine this ideal of public education. 
Supporters of these programs never argue they will serve all children. They simply argue it is a way for some children to get out of public schools. The amendment offered today would provide 2,000 children, at most, with vouchers. But the D.C. public schools serve 78,000 children and about 50,000 are low-income. 
I do not argue that our public schools do not face challenges--violence, disinvestment and declining revenues plague some of our schools, just as they do many other community institutions. 
And our schools are not ignoring these problems--even with limited resources. 
Many are digging themselves out of these problems to offer real hope and opportunities to students. James Comer in Connecticut has led a revolution in public schools across the country by supporting parents and improving education through community involvement and reinvestment in the schools. Public magnet and charter schools are flourishing offering students innovative curriculum and new choices within the public school system. School safety programs, violence prevention curriculum and character education initiatives are making real gains in the struggle against violence in our schools and larger communities. 
And these reform efforts are beginning to show results. Our schools are getting better. Student achievement is up in math, science and reading. The reach of technology has spread to nearly all of our schools. The drop out rate continues to decline. 
We clearly have a ways to go before all our schools are models of excellence, but our goal must be to lend a hand in these critical efforts, not withdraw our support for the schools that educate 89 percent of all students in America--public schools. 
And there is no question about it, private school vouchers will divert much needed dollars away from public schools. Our dollars are limited. We must focus them on improving opportunities for all children by improving the system that serves all children--the public schools. 
The $7 million this amendment would dedicate to D.C. vouchers are much better invested in the District of Columbia's public schools. Last week, Secretary Riley outlined how he would spend these funds on whole school improvement efforts and after-school programs. In addition, the infrastructure needs in D.C. schools remain quite severe--under the leadership of General Beckton, things are improving and these problems are being addressed. But, he estimates infrastructure needs alone top $2 billion. 
Proponents of private school choice argue that vouchers will open up new educational opportunities to low-income families and their children. In fact, vouchers offer private schools, not parents choice. The private schools will pick and choose students, as they do now. Few will choose to serve students with low test scores, with disabilities or with discipline problems. Vouchers, which will be between $2,400 and $3,200, will not come close to covering the cost of tuition at the vast majority of private schools in the District. 
In fact, the tuitions they will cover are at religious schools raising serious constitutional questions. No Federal court has ever upheld the use of vouchers for parochial school or religious education. To receive these funds, private religious schools would likely have to change the nature of their educational programs and eliminate any religious content. Many schools would be unwilling to do this; further limiting parent's ability to choose. 
There are also important accountability issues. Private institutions can fold in mid-year as nearly half a dozen have done in Milwaukee leaving taxpayers to pick up these pieces--only the pieces are children's lives and educations. 
This amendment also establishes a new bureaucracy within the District of Columbia to administer this program. There will be a board of citizens--only one of whom will be appointed by a D.C. official--to set up and oversee this program. For all our criticism of the D.C. government, its layer of bureaucracy, and lack of accountability structures, it is ironic that this amendment would set up yet another governing body. This is a long way from what this city needs. 
Mr. President, our public schools are not just about any one child; they are about all children and all of us. I do not have any children, but I pay property taxes and do so happily to support the education of the children I am counting on to be tomorrow's workers, thinkers, leaders, teachers and taxpayers. 
Our future is dependent on nurturing and developing the potential of every child to its fullest. Investing in our public schools is the best way to reach this goal. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating this amendment.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Defense Appropriations conference report. First, I'd like to recognize Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for the fine work they did in working through the conference issues with their House counterparts. I think that after this vote, it will be clear that the vast majority of this body supports the balance this report strikes between the changing needs of our Armed Forces and the constraints imposed by necessary spending reductions. 
I felt that the conferees made the right decision by endorsing the submarine teaming agreement. That endorsement ends the costly battle between our two submarine builders, saves the taxpayers money, and preserves competition in the research and development phase of submarine building. While some oppose this plan, no one argues the point that this agreement will save the Navy hundreds of millions of dollars over the building plan contained in last year's bill. Furthermore, this plan maintains competition for new ideas on how to improve the new attack submarine. In sum, we have two fine shipyards working together overall to decrease the cost to taxpayers even while they compete on sub-systems to ensure continued technological advancement. 
On a related matter, I'm heartened to see that this report provides funding to complete the Seawolf submarine program. This building program has clearly undergone radical changes as a result of the end of the cold war. At one point, this nation expected to build 30 Seawolf-class submarines and now that number has been reduced to just 3 in favor of the less-costly new attack submarine. So this Nation has already throttled back in terms of its submarine plans; now it's time to move forward with our new plan. 
This conference report also increases the number of Blackhawk helicopters to 28, 10 more than the President requested. And it asks for two navy CH-60 helicopters as well as advance procurement money for that Navy version of the Blackhawk. These additional aircraft reveal once again that the Blackhawk is this Nation's most capable helicopter. Derivatives of this helicopter are at work for nearly every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces as well as 15 foreign countries. As capable and versatile as these helicopters are, however, National Guard adjutant generals throughout the country remind us year after year that they do not have enough. In fact, a conservative reading of the numbers reveals that the National Guard has a shortfall of over 400 Blackhawks. Meanwhile, the production line for these aircraft will shut down in a couple of years. The plan for coping with that shortfall is to rely on Vietnam-era UH-1 helicopters as we move into the next century. Frankly, as the National Guard stands at the front line of defense against devastating natural disasters, they deserve better. I hope the President's next budget request reflects their requirements. 
On a brighter note, this committee made the tough decisions between modernizing military equipment and cutting costs. I was glad to see that the committee agreed with the Defense Department's requests for the C-17 cargo aircraft, the F-22 program, and the emerging Comanche helicopter program. These prudent decisions in support of cost-effective programs will provide vital support for our military forces well into the 21st century. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me congratulate the conferees on completing this bill, the largest of the 13 appropriations bills, before the end of the fiscal year. There was a lot of hard work in negotiations that allowed this bill to move forward and I'm sure that this body and the Nation appreciates their efforts.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me say briefly to my colleagues that what I believe is false and misleading is to suggest what we are trying to do in any way is something injurious to the American consumer. What we are doing is saying that we shouldn't create roadblocks in a process that has been in place for more than 20 years and that has worked well for lower risk devices. To prove a device is substantially equivalent to a product that has already been in the marketplace there are tests which must be complied with, but you don't force the product to prove itself all over again. That negates the process that was set up to be quicker and more efficient and makes patients wait too long to get access to devices which can change their lives, even save their lives. 
If you want to scrap the process altogether and require that every new variation of the predicate product begin this process all over, then let's do that. I don't hear anyone calling for that. 
What the law says is that if it's substantially the same product and if the intended purpose as stated is the same, you don't ask the company to try to guess how someone may use that product for some purpose that the company has not supported. To suggest that a company is going to have to guess as to what other ideas someone may have for the use of that product, and develop data to support those uses--that would make this process null and void. We might as well scrap the entire section and 25 years of effort here. 
The purpose of this bill is to take advantage of new technologies, to see to it we have safe and effective products that are going to reach consumers. To allow an agency to cause a company to have to guess and guess again as to what some other intended purpose would be, I think would be a mistake. 
So I urge, with all due respect, this amendment be rejected 
and the committee bill be supported.

Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President. I am pleased to take the floor today in support of the Consumer Payment Card Security Act of 1997. This legislation, of which I am an original cosponsor, would address a serious gap in our consumer laws which govern the use of debit or check cards. I would particularly like to thank my friend and Chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator D'Amato, for his leadership role in developing this legislation. 
Many of my colleagues may be aware of these cards through the intensive ad campaign mounted by VISA and MasterCard with such famous celebrities as Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, and our former colleague, Bob Dole. But these commercials may not exactly explain how these check cards--or debit cards--work. Essentially, a debit card is a card that looks just like your ATM card that uses the National Credit Card Electronic Networks to access your checking account. In this way, you could go into any business that accepts VISA or MasterCard, and instead of charging your purchase, you could pay for it right out of your checking account. Thus, bank customers have access to their accounts in hundreds of thousands of locations across the globe, not just at the ATM machines that are part of their banks' network. 
In general, I believe that the private sector should be commended for developing this new technology. Clearly, if used properly, these debit cards will provide bank customers with greater flexibility and convenience. 
However, we would not be standing on the floor today introducing legislation if the introduction of this card had gone as smoothly as everyone may have hoped. As with all new technologies, there are growing pains, and in this particular case, legislation appears necessary to help ease those pains. 
The goal of this legislation is refreshingly simple: It puts debit cards under the same umbrella of consumer protections that currently govern the use of both credit cards and ATM cards. 
Let me briefly recount some of the debit card problems--some might go so far as to say abuses--confronted by consumers and how the legislation would address them. 
First, since a debit cards looks almost identical to an ATM card, many consumers don't know that their bank has made a switch. Until very recently, this could have posed a significant financial hardship for consumers since debit card liability--if it's lost or stolen--isn't capped at $50 the way it is capped for both credit cards and ATM cards. Also, debit cards are known as `off-line' cards; in other words, no PIN--personal identification number--is required to use the card--a crook can simply swipe it through any electronic scanner, just like a credit card, and empty your bank account. 
It should be noted that in the last few weeks, the industry--particularly VISA and MasterCard, responding to increasing public pressure, has volunatrily moved to change these practices. Nevertheless, these belated efforts, while laudable, do not provide the same certainty to consumers that the statutes do. This legislation would clearly limit consumer liability to $50, It would also ensure that consumer disclosure is improved so that the bank customer is aware that these cards do not need a PIN to be used. 
The legislation would also end the practice of replacing ATM cards with debit cards without a customer's consent. One of the ways in which these cards become subject to abuse is that consumers aren't aware that they've even received this debit card as a replacement for their old ATM card. The legislation would conform debit cards with credit cards by preventing the mailing of unsolicited cards to bank customers. 
Last, the bill would address a potential problem by shortening the dispute resolution process from 20 to 5 days, again conforming it to the standards currently in use for credit cards. When there is credit card fraud, the cardholder is credited for the loss until the investigation is complete, and that investigation must be done within 5 days. Under current law, debit cardholders are not always credited pending investigation and those investigations can take as long as 20 days. That's a long time for someone whose checking account has been emptied by a criminal. 
Again, Mr. President, I note that in most instances, the legislation codifies what has become the industry standard. But the fact remains that given the difficulties surrounding the introduction of debit cards, and the uncertainties that arise from some companies failing to follow the industry standard, it is incumbent upon the Congress to provide the same statutory safeguards for debit card users as we have for both credit card and ATM card users. 
I hope that I will soon be able to stand here and mark the passage of this important legislation.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, located in the hilly country of southwestern Connecticut in the watershed of the Pequonnock River is the quaint residential community of Trumbull. Despite its proximity to many highly industrialized cities, Trumbull has been able to preserve its small-town New England character and charm, and this year the town of Trumbull will celebrate its 200th anniversary. 
The Trumbull area was permanently settled in 1690, and in the following years families began migrating to this secluded wilderness region, building mills, churches, and schools. In 1725, the settlement officially became the village of Unity, and this village was eventually absorbed by the larger community of North Stratford. Nearly a century after it was settled, the residents began the petition process for independence from North Stratford, and in 1797, the general assembly granted this request, established town bounds, and declared that this area shall forever be a distinct town known by the name of `Trumbull.' 
The town was named after one of the most respected families in Connecticut history, the Trumbulls of Lebanon, CT. The family's patriarch, Jonathan Trumbull, Sr., was the first of four `Governor Trumbulls' in Connecticut. He was a close ally of George Washington, and he was the only colonial Governor to support the Revolution. In recognition of his contributions to his State and his country, a statue of Jonathan Trumbull, Sr., currently stands in the Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol. 
His son, Jonathan Trumbull, Jr., also had an illustrious career as an early American statesman. He was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives where he served as Speaker of the House. He also represented the State as a U.S. Senator and was elected Connecticut's governor in 1797, shortly after the town of Trumbull was incorporated. 
In addition, Jonathan Trumbull, Sr.'s youngest child, John, was one of the most noteworthy American artists known for painting important historical events. Today, four of his paintings hang in the U.S. Capitol rotunda, his most famous being `The Surrender of Cornwallis.' 
While the namesakes for this town were truly heroic individuals, the many generations of Trumbull residents who have settled this town and shepherded its evolution over the years are equally heroic in their own right. They met the crises of their times. They worked hard to ensure a promising future for their children. They lent a helping hand to their neighbors when they were in need. They did all of the things that are necessary to sustain a community and help it develop into a wonderful place to live. 
Today, Trumbull is a vibrant residential community which is dedicated to the preservation of its family-oriented atmosphere. Its schools are among the best in the State and the Parent-Teachers Association is very active. There are places of worship for more than a dozen different religions, strengthening the fabric of the community and adding to its diversity. More than 1,000 acres of town-owned open space are set aside for recreational use, and Trumbull is renowned for its numerous public parks. Trumbull has also invested in its children by establishing an excellent youth sports program. In fact, one of the town's and the State of Connecticut's proudest moments came when a resilient group of 11- and 12-year-olds from Trumbull pulled off one of the greatest upsets in baseball history and won the Little League World Series in 1988. 
Trumbull's motto is `Pride in our past. Faith in our future.' I would like to personally say that the people of Trumbull should be very proud of their town's history and heritage. But more important, I have complete faith that the future for the people of Trumbull will be even brighter than the past. I congratulate the town of Trumbull on this historic milestone and offer my best wishes for future centuries of success and prosperity.

Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Let me begin by commending the chairman of the committee, Mr. President, for the work he has done on this bill and for others who have been involved in it. 
We are arriving at the point here where we have a 211-page bill put together in the past 2 1/2 years, where we are, hopefully, down to its last provision, which has been the subject of some discussion over the last number of days. 
I want to just at the outset commend those who have been involved in it, explaining what the purpose of the intent here is. We have passed this bill out of our committee 14 to 4. There was some disagreement over a number of provisions, but I believe we produced a very fine product which is going to assist tremendously in making this even more secure in the quality of products we are getting but also the efficiency with which those products become available to patients and people in this country. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for the explanation. 
This has become an arcane subject matter when we talk about paragraphs and titles and how the FDA process works. That is the reason the committee has spent so much time going back over this material, to try to sort out exactly what would work best and how it would apply. 
Contrary to how it has been portrayed thus far, the provision in the bill which is the subject of this amendment--what it does, Mr. President, is it shrinks back to current law an authority that the FDA has been stretching, in our view, past the bounds of fair practices. 
So the effort here is to try to get back exactly to what the intent has been. All we, the authors of the bill, are asking is that the FDA not force manufacturers to supply information on other than the imputed uses for which the manufacturer is not seeking approval and could not market the product even if they wanted to. 
You can see how the FDA in the current practice of second-guessing manufacturers can certainly create uncertainty not only in terms of the manufacturer but also in terms of consumers. A manufacturer, Mr. President, can spend years designing a product for a specific purpose only to be told by the FDA that it should go back to the drawing board and test the product for uses other than those for which the product was created in the first place. That creates tremendous uncertainty. 
Let me, if I can, Mr. President, try to describe this process and what we are talking about. That is where it gets a bit arcane. The Senator from Rhode Island, I think properly, characterized some of the differentiations here, but I think he gets lost on some people. What we are talking about here are not high-risk devices but lower risk devices. 
Ninety-five percent of the products that come out of the FDA for approval in this area are lower risk devices. What is a lower risk device and what is the process that exists today that allows for the approval of these products to be marketed? 
Well, the lower risk device goes through, as the Senator from Rhode Island has described, a 510(k) process. That is the applicable provisions at the FDA. Under that provision, if a manufacturer wants to bring out a lower risk medical device, they must prove that the new device is `substantially equivalent'--I am quoting here--`to a device already on the market,' the so-called predicate device. That is why it is called a lower risk device. There already then has been the approval of a product that is substantially equivalent to a product that the manufacturer wants to bring out. 
So the decision was made, instead of having a manufacturer go through a de novo process, which can take years, as it should, that we are going to expedite that process as long as there is a predicate out there--there is a predicate out there--there has already been a product that is `substantially equivalent,' to quote the FDA. If that exists, then you can go, for the lower risk device, to the 510(k) process. 
There are two tests--two tests--that you must meet if you are going to get FDA approval under that provision--the lower risk device, not the higher risk device. No one is debating that. We are talking about the lower risk device. The two tests are the following. 
The first is that the device has the same intended use as the predicate device. That is a subjective test. Does it have the same intended use? Does the label say that? Does the marketing, does the information the company is putting out have the same intended use? That is a subjective test. And if a manufacturer puts on the label some other use, then they would fail that test--the intended use. 
To say that a manufacturer must also now have some imputed use that you could not imagine, that you did not design, that you did not think about, that some doctor may decide they want to use it for, is not what that paragraph is all about. That is the first test. 
But the second test is far more important. This bill does nothing to the second test at all. The second test is that the new device's technological differences do not raise new questions of safety and efficacy. That is an objective test, Mr. President. That is an objective test. Nothing in this bill changes anything in that second test. 
What we are trying to do is to get back to that first test and say it is the intended use of that predicate device, the intended use of the predicate device. If the manufacturer does not meet both of these tests, then the FDA does not have to clear the device. 
This provision does not change that in any way whatsoever. You have to meet both tests. All that we are asking in this bill, among other things that we have tried to reform here, is that we be able to draw some lines around the first and very subjective test of the intended use while retaining FDA's full discretion on the much more objective tests of the technological differences. Now, in our view, with all due respect, the FDA has been stretching its authority by trying to impute uses that the manufacturer has no intention of doing. 
We have been given some examples over the past week of how the act would only test the intended use on the label. In fact, as I said, there are two tests under 510(k). In each of the examples that have been given, the FDA had the ability to stop the devices from going on the market because they failed the second test. No reference has been made to that. They failed the second test, not the intended purpose, but the technological differences. 
All the examples that have been given, of course, are tragic ones, deaths and injuries resulting from the Dalkon shield, a woman who contracted toxic-shock syndrome from superabsorbent tampons, disfigurement caused by artificial jaw joints, and faulty plastic eyelashes that led to blindness. 
These are all tragic examples without question. But in every single case it was not because they failed the first test, the intended use; it was because they failed the second test. They were technologically flawed. It was not somehow that the manufacturer produced a product that was used for some different purpose than the intended use on the label, but that the product was faulty, technologically it was faulty. 
So we cite these examples and then say the reason that people lost their lives or were disfigured was because the manufacturer used it for some purpose or someone used for it for a purpose other than was labeled. That is not the case. It just is not the case. So I urge my colleagues when looking at this, as technical and as arcane as it may be--and most Members do not follow FDA regulations, do not get involved in the details of it--but with lower risk devices there are two tests, all within this bill. This amendment we are dealing with is the first test, the intended use. 
In every example cited, the horror stories cited, the tragic losses cited, in every single case it was the failure of the second test, which is not the subject of the amendment offered by the Senator from Rhode Island. 
I urge my colleagues to pay attention to those of us who worked on this and understand what we are talking about. We are trying to see if we cannot narrow down the problem on the intended use sections. 
Mr. President, let me talk here a bit about what our purposes are here. If we allow the FDA to have free rein in the sense of having to guess at what a lower risk product could conceivably be used for once it is in the hands of physicians, then there is no end, in my view, to the studies that could be required of manufacturers to produce. 
Some suggest perhaps we need a threshold to that guessing; maybe the FDA is `kind of' sure that the doctors would not use the device for another purpose. That would be the right threshold. Maybe `really' being sure would be sufficient in some cases. Can you see how unworkable a concept like this would be? Anytime the FDA is told they can look into their crystal ball and guess how a doctor might use a product, the result is going to be uncertainty. 
Mr. President, let me step back a second. There is not a single Member of this body that in any way wants to be associated with or part of an effort that is going to endanger anyone's life at all. In fact, quite the contrary. We want to do everything we can to see to it that people are getting safe products, efficient products, effective products that will serve their interests and protect their lives. That is our purpose and intent. We also want to see patients able to get products and have them reach the market. Certainly there are going to be those who will be fraudulent, bad actors. No one is suggesting they do not exist. Nothing we will do here will stop that, I suppose. 
But to suggest somehow that because we are trying to in some way tighten up the intended use or purpose on the lower risk devices, that those who support this idea are guilty of somehow jeopardizing people all across this country, I think is an unfair characterization. It is quite the contrary. 
In fact, a major company in my State of Connecticut, U.S. Surgical, with 9,000 employees, has come up with some of the most creative, imaginative, and effective devices to reduce the risks of injury and to preserve lives. It is a very reputable company. The company has brought to the American people revolutionary technology. 
They were leaders in creating minimally invasive surgery using laparoscopes. Patients used to be laid up for months, or weeks anyway, after a gall bladder operation. As a result of laparoscopic surgery, now a person can be back at work within days because of the technology developed by U.S. Surgical. 
The breast biopsy, which has been discussed here, was developed 2 years ago by U.S. Surgical and has been received by surgeons with overwhelming support in this country. Women have benefited from its use in over 7,000 cases worldwide. It is a safe and reputable company. I think it has been unfairly labeled as otherwise. In fact, regarding the biopsy, in trying to approve technology that would improve the technology, they should have received plaudits for that. The FDA approved it. There were questions raised about whether or not this was actually being used as a surgery to remove tumors. Never did the manufacturer ever suggest that was the case. Having listened to some of the debate, that was the implication. 
Mr. President, I think it is unfortunate that that becomes the manner in which we debate a question here about one provision we are trying to narrow a bit in lower risk products. 
Mr. President, there are a few examples of instances where the FDA has attempted to second-guess the manufacturers of a device about the device's intended use. One was an endoscope, an example where a manufacturer was asked to submit data on how the materials of a device would hold up after multiple uses. The company, in fact, insisted the label clearly state the product should only be used once and then discarded. That is what the label said. That is what the company and the manufacturer intended--one usage of this endoscope. In the second case, a manufacturer designed a hearing aid to reduce background noise. The FDA decided that the real intended use was better hearing, and required the manufacturer to submit clinical data to prove that the device helped hearing overall. In a third case, Mr. President, a manufacturer developed a catheter that was coated with a substance that enhances the integrity of the device materials when the device is implanted in the body. The FDA decided the coating was really intended to reduce infection, and required clinical data to prove it. 
Mr. President, in each of these cases the manufacturer was not seeking to promote or market the device for the imputed use at all and would have been prohibited from doing so, and the 
FDA's authority in no way is eroded. If the FDA believes that the company is off on some imputed use they have the authority to deal with that problem. We don't change that in this law at all. 
I also point out, Mr. President, in each case a useful device was delayed from reaching consumers in this country. That is what we are talking about here. 
I talked earlier about the biopsy, the testing device developed by U.S. Surgical. U.S. Surgical received approval from the FDA for a breast biopsy needle to be used for diagnostic purposes only, diagnostic purposes only. After the product was approved and on the market, the FDA asked for more information about the efficacy and the safety of the device for taking adequate biopsy samples--an appropriate request. U.S. Surgical supplied the information, and the second approval for the product was given by the FDA. At no time was the device marketed for another purpose. At no time was the device marketed for any other purpose than for diagnostic purposes. 
I come back to the section, the 510(k), the lower risk medical devices. Two tests--the subjective test of intended use based on the label; and the second test on the technological questions, which is an objective test. Had the manufacturer said on its label or in its information or its marketing packages, `By the way, this will be a good diagnostic device and it may just work in terms of dealing with the tumor,' you have immediately violated the first test because your intended purpose is other than what you are seeking approval. But that is a subjective case. That is the way this works. 
If you want to scrap 510(k) and put everything on the same footing, why don't we have an amendment that does that? I don't hear anyone suggesting that. We are trying to get these devices out where there is a predicate; that is, there has been a product already approved, which is substantially equivalent, substantially equivalent, to the device seeking approval. I urge my colleagues to remember that when you are considering how to vote on this. This is not high risk. This is low risk. Two tests--subjective test, intended purpose; second test, is it technologically faulty, is it safe? 
In the case of U.S. Surgical's diagnostic test for breast cancer, which has been overwhelmingly received, by the way--in fact, I think we will hear later from a colleague of ours who is a beneficiary of this--overwhelmingly accepted. Had they thought to do something else with that biopsy, then they would be in violation of this test. That was not the case and to suggest otherwise is just not true. 
If it had been, the FDA would have had full authority to request data on the safety and efficacy of the device for the unapproved purpose. It would still have that authority under this provision. At no time did the FDA request any data for U.S. Surgical regarding the use of the breast biopsy device for tumor removal. So when this case is cited now, twice I heard it cited, I hope my colleagues would understand what the facts are. This is a fine company and the suggestion somehow they are producing devices out there for purposes other than what was intended, risking consumers in this country, is unfair to that company and unfair to the people who work there. 
Mr. President, I urge our colleagues when considering this amendment--and again I respect entirely the motivations behind it; certainly all of us want to see the safest possible devices on the market, but we also want to see a process that will allow 
the products to get to that marketplace and serve the people they are designed to serve. If we are talking about something new, the tests are different, and they should be. If it is substantially equivalent to a device already out there, we have made the collective determination 20 years ago that the test ought to be different. When you go beyond that, in effect, if you are trying to take a lower risk device and apply it to a standard that exists to a higher risk device you are defeating the very purpose for which 510(k) exists. 
With all due respect to my colleague from Rhode Island, I urge this amendment be defeated. In my view, the responses here are not arguing this provision on its merits. Instead, we are hearing language that I don't think reflects exactly what the situation is, what the facts are. While appealing on the surface, because some horrible cases have been cited as I pointed out, in every single instance in those cases it was not a debate about whether or not the manufacturer was producing a product for one purpose and used for another. In every single case those devices failed the second test of 510(k), not the first test of the intended purpose. 
By definition, the process of determining substantial equivalence, a label is neither true nor false. It is the same as the predicate. If it is not the same as the predicate, then it does not pass the first test. In effect, trying to squeeze false and misleading language into a place it doesn't fit means all devices would be undergoing the PMA process, a process that can take up to six times longer, six times longer. When there are patients out there and families out there that want to see this material get to them, we don't need to be complicating a process on low risk devices, delaying that event occurring, causing more pain and suffering. There are people who suffer as a result of a regulatory process that is so overburdened and so complicated that people cannot get these materials when they need them. 
Mr. President, again, with all due respect, I urge my colleagues reject this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Now, there are clinicians out there who have put out videos and other educational materials on medical practice issues. U.S. Surgical is aware of that. It can happen. But the implication that U.S. Surgical is now actively promoting unapproved uses is not true.

Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield. This company is not engaged in promoting unapproved uses for this biopsy needle. And U.S. Surgical categorically denies any association with any materials produced by others where this might have occurred. The FDA has approved the breast biopsy needle. The FDA has approved it twice, in fact, only for breast biopsies. Accordingly, U.S. Surgical does not promote the device or market the device for tumor removal. It is aware now that articles and videos do exist which discuss other uses of the devices. It is very common, and completely legal, for physicians to explore other possible uses of both drugs and devices as part of the practice of medicine. But the suggestion somehow that the company is now actively promoting this device for something other than diagnostic purposes, with all due respect, is just not true. 
And the question that we should be asking here--a very important question--is, if this obviously illegal practice is 
occurring, if U.S. Surgical is actively promoting this product for an off-label use, why hasn't the FDA gone after the company? Now, clearly, if it were true, the FDA, with all the force of law would go out and pursue them vehemently. Promotion of a device for unapproved uses is one of the most egregious violations a company can commit. Surely if this were the case, and evidence of it were so readily available, FDA would have acted. But there has been no FDA action, because there has been no violation. And to suggest otherwise is irresponsible. 
I mentioned earlier, if my colleague will continue to yield, that U.S. Surgical has promoted this device for the purpose for which it was approved--to give women and their surgeons a useful option in conducting breast biopsies. There are good medical reasons that a larger size biopsy might need to be taken. In conducting biopsies you do can not always get a reliable tissue sample just with a small needle--some tumors are just too diffuse. Evidence shows that, with some types of tumors, taking a larger biopsy gives the surgeon a far better chance of determining the quality of the tumor accurately without the need to take multiple, painful biopsies. 
That is why this device was developed. And as women who have been through this will tell you, it is important to have this device as an option for taking an accurate and safe breast biopsy.

Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, as I said earlier, if U.S. Surgical were promoting for uses beyond those on the label, I think the FDA would be acting on it. But let me again get to the point of why a larger needle is useful in some biopsies situations. I am not a surgeon or a doctor, but I am just sharing with my colleagues here, and my colleague from Massachusetts, why this larger needle may be needed. This Advanced Breast Biopsy device, as it is called, does remove a larger amount of tissue than a conventional biopsy needle. Why? Why does it need to do that? This difference in needle size is not related to tumor removal. Rather, it addresses clinicians' requirements for sampling different types of lesions. Why do they do that?  
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-dodd-ct-11-19970923</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DODD. I will just finish the paragraph. Breast lesions exist not only as discrete nodules but oftentimes as clusters of tiny particles known as microcalcifications. These microcalcifications appear diffuse on an X-ray; similar to the Milky Way. That's how surgeons describe it. 
Due to this fact, obtaining adequate amounts of tissue for biopsy is important in order to optimize accurate diagnosis, so that women don't have to go through surgery unnecessarily. This needle allows clinicians to take a larger single sampling, rather than many, painful, smaller samples that could perhaps miss the tumor tissue. That is why this product was developed. That is why it has been so supported by women and by surgeons. 
My colleague from Massachusetts can talk about videos that promote purposes other than this one. However, if that is the case, the FDA ought to be in there this very minute. But, they have not acted because no violation has occurred.

Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
Mr. President, I sat here and listened to this debate this morning. A good part of it has been focused, not on the merits of the provision, but on one individual company in the State of Connecticut, U.S. Surgical Corp., and a device which they developed for diagnostic purposes related to breast cancer. 
I think it is unfortunate that there have been so many misleading statements made about this company, who not once, but twice, received full FDA approval for this diagnostic device. 
I would like to make the fact extremely clear--just for the purposes of the Record. The company's original application was submitted to the FDA on October 5, 1995 and was cleared by the FDA 119 days later, 
on February 1, 1996. 
The company resubmitted their medical device under the 510(k) on September 23, 1996, with additional clinical data requested by the FDA. This resubmitted 510(k) was cleared by the FDA on December 20, 1996, 88 days later. The process works. 
I cite for the Record here, Mr. President, what is on the label. 
Indication: For diagnostic sampling of breast tissue where large diameter incisional breast biopsies are desired. 
Contraindication: The device is used for diagnostic breast tissue biopsies; it is not [in bold letters] intended for therapeutic excision of tissues.

Mr. DODD. This is the chronology of the events. This device is being used to try and improve biopsy and diagnostic purposes and reduce, hopefully, the need for unnecessary surgery--something most people applaud. And the label clearly limits the product to that purpose. 
The Senator from Massachusetts suggests that this is somehow a rationale for us to reduce or change the language of this bill that deals with the approval process for less riskier medical devices. He cites a lot of examples that has nothing to do with this issue. Fen/phen has nothing to do with this amendment. The Dalkon shield has nothing to do with this amendment; that was a failure of technology that had nothing to do with the intended purpose of the device. 
The examples cited, one after another, do not address the issue at hand. The issue at hand is how the FDA interprets intended use in making a substantial equivalence determination --the first test a lower risk device undergoes. That is what we are dealing with here. 
If you have to say to a company that it must try and imagine what a device conceivably could be used for by some surgeon out there, and on that basis FDA can hold up its 510(k), you might as well scrap 510(k) and make every new device, even low-risk ones, go through the PMA process. You can make a case for that, I suppose. But I don't hear anyone advocating that. But if you really believe that we ought to so change this process, then get rid of 510(k) altogether--that is the safest way to go. But again, I don't hear anyone suggesting that. 
All we are saying here is, the FDA ought to look at the intended purpose listed, and ought not try and go beyond that, particularly when they have full authority to apply the second test of reviewing technological differences. All we are trying to do here is to expedite the process a bit so we do not delay further the ability of very worthwhile devices to get approved by the FDA and get to the marketplace. 
I regret deeply that a very fine company with a tremendous track record that has produced some wonderful devices has been the subject of an attack here on the floor. It is not deserved. It is not deserved. They produce a very worthwhile product, the breast biopsy needle, that has been approved by the FDA and is making a difference in women's lives. There are thousands of examples of where this device and other products made by this company have made a difference in people's lives. This company, U.S. Surgical, has been manufacturing medical devices in Connecticut for over 30 years now and has an excellent track record for producing safe, effective, and innovative products. In addition to setting the gold standard for the laproscopic surgery devices, as I mentioned earlier, I should also note that U.S. Surgical pioneered the technique of closing wounds with staples, rather than sutures--a revolution in everyday medical practice. The thousands of Connecticut workers who help create these products, ought to be applauded by our colleagues rather than used as an irrelevant example, somehow, of some attempt to limit the protections that the FDA offers. 
For those reasons, Mr. President, I urge our colleagues, with all due respect, to reject the Reed-Kennedy amendment and to support the provision we have included in this legislation which we feel not only adequately protects people, but does even more than that. It allows them to get the materials they need to see they have a healthier and safe life.

Mr. DODD. I want to commend our colleague from Alaska. I think this is a very responsible approach to take. I urge our colleagues to support it. 
There are a lot of ideas out here about how we might create a true endowment rather than going through this process year in and year out. We are politicizing this issue to an extent I don't think it deserves. We truly ought to look for ways to resolve this matter intelligently. 
I think a good set of hearings, examining various ideas on how to best fund the Endowment for the future make a lot of sense. I urge our colleagues to support this suggestion and try to come together and see if we cannot get beyond this amendment process we go through each and every year which I don't think serves our interests well, regardless of one's perspective on how we ought to fund the National Endowment for the Arts.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise, with all due respect to my colleague from Arkansas, in opposition to his amendment. I say to my colleagues here, with all due respect, my colleague is certainly one who has advocated in the past that we ought to try to remove or eliminate as much bureaucracy as possible. I think he is joined in those sentiments by most of us here in Congress, that we ought to be trying to not overburden a process but trying to streamline it as much as possible. 
I commend President Clinton for coming up with a very innovative and creative idea on how we might highlight the importance of our river system in the United States. This program of designation of 10 great rivers in the United States, I think, has great value. It is something that is community driven, rather than something coming from Washington. 
Let me just share with my colleagues how this would work. First of all, there are no mandates or regulations involved in this at all. In fact, it must be supported by the congressional delegations, the communities involved, and it is very explicit as to how this process would work. The amendment being offered by our colleague from Arkansas would require communities to go through additional layers of Government approval before a river could be designated an American heritage river. 
Just to give you an example, those of us in the New England area are united--in New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. We have all come together in a delegation--the communities, the States--requesting that the Connecticut River be one of those designated rivers. Very explicitly, if that support in the delegation from the Governors in the communities along the river is not present then that river is not going to be selected. It has been felt very, very important that there be community-driven, community-based support for these efforts. And if it is nonexistent, the designation doesn't happen. 
Some of my colleagues may not want that designation. I can tell you categorically that if the Senators in those States do not want the rivers in their States, be it Colorado, or in Arkansas, then it won't happen. You don't have to worry about that. Nothing is going to be foisted on any State here that is not supported by the communities. 
What we are suggesting here is that we in the New England States would like one of these rivers. In all due respect, I don't think it would be fair for me in this kind of a situation to be suggesting as a Senator from Connecticut that the people of Arkansas or Colorado, or any other State, ought to be denied that designation if they feel they very much like to see the Arkansas River or the Colorado River designated as one of these great rivers, with no regulations, no mandates, no money involved in it. It merely takes existing resources and tries to manage them in a way that the people at the local level would like to see them designated and to enhance the cultural, the economic, and environmental issues that they feel are very important. 
I can tell you categorically that in my part of the country one of the problems that has happened over the years is that too much of our development has occurred right on the river denying people access to the river. One of the wonderful things about this city--our Capital City--that I appreciate every morning as I come to the Capitol is you can actually watch people on the banks of the Potomac River enjoying the river. For too many of our cities, of course, we saw the highway systems, and so forth, be developed between a city and its river. There is a great interest now in this country to try to restore, if you will, the vitality of these rivers--to see if we can't come up with ways to recognize the importance of them. 
Again, the requirement that our colleague from Arkansas adds here would delay the initiative designed to provide prompt assistance to community-led efforts. After communities submit nomination packets to the administration, the President selects rivers for designation. The Council on Environmental Quality would have to forward these nominations to Congress which must provide approval. However, the amendment, as outlined, no process, or deadline, for congressional action would be required then to get approval basically of almost every single property owner. Imagine getting approval from the Connecticut River States, from the Canadian border on down to the Long Island Sound, of every private property owner in New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. It would kill it. Why not have an amendment to eliminate it altogether? That might make more sense than making people go through a process that just kills it by bureaucracy. Why not have an amendment that would say this amendment ought to be eliminated? If that were the case, I would disagree with it. I would oppose it. But at least it would be clear. The intent here, by establishing a very lengthy process that would deny these community-driven programs, I think, would be a huge mistake. 
Let me also point out that there are no additional dollars involved here at all in what has been suggested, and no new regulations, or changes in existing law. The American Heritage Rivers Initiative does not change the existing prioritization process for the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, or any other applicable Federal law. Given that the American heritage 
rivers initiative imposes no new regulations, any activity undertaken to designate rivers would naturally abide by the laws governing priorities of the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, and other Federal laws. 
State and local reviews: Any projects identified in a communities-nomination packet must undergo applicable State and local review processes. Property owners are key at this stage of the review. I can say categorically that they are involved now in our New England area with the Connecticut River. We pulled together the support. We have solicited opinions from our local communities to get behind this effort. Obviously, local property owners have a more than adequate way of expressing their feelings about whether or not we ought to be going forward. There is strong feeling, in our area anyway, that this is a process that we approve of. We support fully and strongly that it ought to be included. 
As I said earlier, if delegations don't want rivers in their States to be included in this competition, if you will, to designate 10 rivers, then that is it. You are out. Don't worry about it. There is no way in the world that you are going to be included in this. 
So, if the Colorado River wants to be excluded from the process, I can categorically tell you that it will be out--or the Arkansas River. If anyone stands up here today and votes for this amendment, I promise you that you won't be included. You are out. Don't worry about it. But for those of us who would like this designation, who feel strongly about it in a bipartisan way, who believe that there is something of value here in trying to restore our rivers, to give attention to them, to appreciate the value of them historically, environmentally, economically, we would like this designation. We think it will help us, and our local communities want it. They support it. 
Frankly, to go through a long morass of bureaucracy, and going through one agency after another, coming back and getting approval, having every single property owner express their view one way or the other, this is just killing it--choking it to death. 
So my hope is that our colleagues here would oppose this amendment. Again, this has broad-based and community-based support in the country, and I think has great value in terms of those of us who care deeply about seeing these rivers restored. 
I can tell you. I live on the Connecticut River. I have my office on the Connecticut River. In fact, it is a better Connecticut River. I can remember the days only a few years ago when the thought of swimming in that river, or fishing out of that river, or eating any fish out of the river, was unheard of. Today it has come back because there have been great local efforts to restore the vitality of that river. The salmon are coming back. The Connecticut River shad are back. 
Dartmouth, in New Hampshire, and the University of Massachusetts all understand the value of this. Our communities of Hartford and Middletown in Connecticut, and Springfield, MA, all believe that this is a very worthwhile project, and are solidly behind it. 
It is not just one river. But I can tell you also that it is highly competitive. I know my colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato, is deeply interested in the Hudson River. And great support exists in that State for the designation. I know the same case exists across the country. I think it is a healthy process that communities and States are going through. 
To add to the regulatory burden here by requiring, as this amendment would, a tremendous effort to get some designation here where there is apparently opposition within those States, I would say to those people that you need not worry about it. 
In fact, for those of us who would like to designate and realize that it is highly competitive, maybe we ought to realize it the way it is here. If we get a good vote, we can eliminate a lot of rivers from being designated. Because I can clearly tell you, if Members vote for this, that is going to be a pretty strong case for those of us who want the designation--that Senators who vote 
for this, those rivers ought to be excluded from this process; and that we will just go with the colleagues here who come from States that represent rivers that would like to have this designation. 
This is no money regulation. There are no regulations, no mandates, no money. It is community-based, community-driven, and community-supported. 
And, if you are opposed, if you are not included, why in the world do we go through a process here where we require Congress to come up and support or deny and elongate things? It basically kills this. This is making a huge mountain, if you will, out of a trickle, in a sense. This is not that big a deal except to the extent that it allows for these rivers to be designated as important natural resources that our States would like to protect and preserve for future generations. That is all it really is, and no more than that. 
To come up here and suggest somehow that this is some great big Federal program is dictating to local communities somehow denying them the process of making decisions about their own futures along these rivers is just not the case. 
So, Mr. President, I urge our colleagues here, with all due respect, to reject this amendment when the time arises. 
I note my colleague from Rhode Island wanted to be heard on this. I will be glad to yield to him, or seek his own time.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, to respond to my colleague from Arkansas--I know my colleague from Rhode Island wants to be heard--my colleague must be aware--I presume he is--of how the process works. The suggestion somehow that this process excludes local property owners from expressing their opinions is just not the case. In fact, it is very, very clear, as laid out by the Executive order, how the process would work. Certainly local input and people expressing their views, whether or not they are in favor or opposed to this, is very much a part of the process here. 
This is complicating it by mandating through law. The implication here obviously is that Congress is going to make the decision as to whether or not these rivers in various areas are going to be designated so you have a vote of 51 to 49 picking this river or that. We are trying to avoid that, to keep the politics out of it. 
If you go back and look at how it works, it requires that there be local input and approval and support at the local level. That is the whole idea. Obviously, to have Washington sit here and pick 10 rivers, we don't know whether you want to be designated. So this is entirely superfluous. The process exists right now that requires that effort. Support from local communities is all through the Executive order from the administration as to how this would work. 
My point is, if that is the case, if that is what we are doing, it requires that input. To all of a sudden say we are going to have here a law that makes us go through congressional hearings and looking at all of this I think just is making more out of this than has to be the case.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be relatively brief here. I gather there are a couple of our colleagues who want to come over and be heard on the amendment itself. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-dodd-ct-7-19970918</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DODD. Furthermore, let me lay out how this works. This is not just sort of throwing this out. We are going to have some sort of political determination made regarding these 10 heritage rivers. 
First of all, the administration stated that if a Senator or a Member of Congress opposes a designation in his or her State or district, the designation will not occur. That at least gives people an opportunity here to express the wishes of their communities. So, today we will have a vote on this. I presume that is the way people want to express how they feel about this. If colleagues want to vote for the Hutchinson amendment, the amendment of my colleague from Arkansas, that's a good indication of where you stand on this, and that can certainly narrow down the process, I suppose, here. That would be, I presume, an expression of how your constituency felt on this. 
Second, the administration has proposed a panel of experts representing economic development, including agriculture, natural resources, environmental protection, historic and cultural preservation, to review all the nominations and make recommendations to the President. This would not only, I think, ensure a fair and objective process, but guarantee the designations are made in a timely manner. So it is not going to be made by one individual. You bring together people to determine what are the qualifications that ought to be looked at. Certainly, some of the already existing Federal laws regarding clean water are very, very important. There are other considerations, and that ought to be a part of it. 
Third, there must be broad-based support for this. In the nomination package submitted, communities must show a broad base of support, including property owners, State, tribal, local governments, before this package is going to be accepted. 
Let me suggest here, by the way, that it spells it out. `The administration recommends that supporters should reflect'--I am reading here, now, `the diversity of the community, including but not limited to property owners, as appropriate, and as stated in the Federal Register notice they should include farmers, ranchers, landowners, businesses and industries, education, arts organizations, youth groups, community leaders, developers, community development organizations, historical societies, environmental groups and other nonprofit organizations, elected officials, State, tribal and local governments.' You can't get much broader than that. You have to demonstrate that kind of support. 
Private property owners are an important element here. It is not limited to that. If we are going to ask people to give comment out here, certainly we are suggesting that ought to come from those people, but there are other entities as well that are affected by it. Businesses are affected by it. Universities are affected by it. Communities are affected by it. 
What the Register says here is get the comments from everybody here including private property owners. Does it say to get every single private property owner? No; that would be a nightmare. On the Connecticut River, 500 miles of river through four States and congested urban areas, are you going to get a comment from every private property owner? Why not kill the whole thing? That's the idea. Get rid of it. Have an amendment that says there should be no designation of 10 heritage rivers. That's a lot cleaner. But the idea somehow in four States where we are applying--no guarantee we are going to be accepted; we are for this in four States--the delegations are for it, the communities are for it, we have to go back now and go through 510 miles on both sides of the Connecticut River, 10 miles on either side, and get comments from every single property owner, with all due respect, kills this. 
There is a cleaner way of killing it; a cleaner way of killing it than maiming this process and adding a huge bureaucracy where we go out now, because we like this, and go through the next year or two where local communities, at some expense, are going out and 
getting comment from every single property owner. Talk about adding to the burden of a process. There is no mandate here, no regulations, no money. Just a designated 10 rivers in the country as being heritage rivers. Talk about adding to the cost of local taxpayers and communities--this amendment does that. 
Here we require, the administration requires, broad-based comment. Nominations may only be made--they may only be made by members of the community. That is the only way this can occur. It doesn't occur because some Senator nominates it. It has to come from the community. That is exactly the purpose and the intent here. So, the idea of going across and saying we are going to exclude everyone else in the process--there are no new regulations or changes in existing law. The American heritage rivers does not change the existing prioritization process for the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, or any other preexisting law. Given that the American heritage river initiative imposes no new regulations on any activities undertaken or designated on designated rivers, people would naturally abide by the law, obviously, in areas that are covered under those provisions of law. Any project identified in a community's nomination package must undergo applicable State, and local review processes. Property owners are key at this stage of the review. The administration believes such review should remain a local issue and Federal agencies should assume no additional roles in what is a local decision. 
In the nomination package, communities must demonstrate that members of the community have had an opportunity to comment and discuss the nominations and plan of action. That is required. When you submit your package from a local community, you have to demonstrate you have gone out to the community and solicited the views of the people of your community. 
It even goes further, so it is not just a mayor or select person in town, but it is actually that you have to demonstrate in the local community you have solicited the comments and the views of people in that community, including your private property owners. 
In implementing the American heritage river initiative, Federal departments and agencies are required to act with due regard for the protection of private property owners, provided by the fifth amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and as directed by Ronald Reagan, President Reagan's 1988 Executive Order No. 12360. 
I must say here, this has been pretty well thought out here, requiring applications must come from the community. The community leaders must solicit the opinion of people in their communities. It also solicits the views of others in addition to the private property owners along those rivers, but doesn't require every single one of them, as does this amendment, as it insists. I read it to you. It says here: 
`To ensure the protection of private property owners along a river proposed for nomination, all property owners'--I am reading now line 17, 16 and 17--`all property owners holding title to land directly abutting river bank shall be consulted and asked to offer letters of support for or opposition to the nomination.' 
All 510 miles of the Connecticut River? Along the Mississippi River, all property owners? Colorado River, all properties owners are required here? It would be a nightmare. Why not just a simple amendment, `There shall be no designation of American heritage rivers'? It is cleaner; up or down, yes or no. 
What if in the process we go through this process by communities, by towns all across the country going through this process, at great cost, and at the end we don't get designated, someone else does? I understand that. But why make us go through all of this? Why not just say, `We don't like the program; get rid of it.' 
As I said earlier, if people don't want this, if Members of Congress, the delegation does not want it, believe me, you won't be included. It is simple, straightforward, guaranteed, no problem. 
If any Senators here decide they don't want their States to be included, the rivers that run through them, vote that way today and, believe me, the process gets thinner. Believe me, it gets thinner. Those of us in the New England States certainly feel that. 
Senator Chafee of Rhode Island pointed out, on page 3, the definition of a river community:  
For the purposes of the American Heritage Rivers Initiative . . ., the term `river community' shall include all persons that own property, reside or regularly conduct business within 10 miles of the river. 
I have almost 500 miles of Connecticut River, add 10 miles on either side of it and go up and down there, you add to my nightmare of everyone who abuts the river. Now I have to go 10 miles to either side. This gets unbelievably cumbersome to try to do something as simple as designation of 10 heritage rivers--no mandates, no regulations, no money to try to manage it here and nothing can be done by a Federal agency that runs into opposition of local agencies and governments. 
This has been well thought out, Mr. President, well thought out by a panel of people who will designate it. It is not going to be made by someone in the White House who picks out a river, but to try to see if we can't come up with a group of people here who will make intelligent choices about this. 
This is really pretty straightforward. Again, I can tell you, and it may differ from place to place in the country, but I gather it is pretty competitive. We have people all across the country excited about this. 
We have had about six different meetings in my State. We invited the head, the chief administrator, for the Environmental Protection Agency. We had a huge crowd turn out expressing their support--the communities, the business leaders--saying this is something we really want here. 
Now to go back and say we have to get every single property owner for 10 miles on either side on this thing to designate river communities, this would be a great blow, I think, to millions of people in this country who would like to see their rivers restored, who like the fact that there is a President in this country who has said we ought to pay attention to this. 
Hopefully, this is just the beginning of a process where more rivers can be designated in the future. I suspect we are going to have a lot of hurt feelings at the end of this process. We only have 10 that are going to be designated out of the entire country. But the fact that 10 will be and maybe others can be to highlight the importance of these rivers, the communities and all the activities associated with it, I think ought to be applauded. The fact that the administration has put in place a very deliberate, thoughtful process of where this should begin, how it ought to be conducted, who makes the decisions, who is going to be consulted, I think is something that deserves applause, rather than coming up, as I say with all due respect, with an amendment that would basically gut this process entirely and make it impossible for millions of people across this country to celebrate their rivers and to try to restore them to the cultural, historic, economic, and environmental importance that they ought to have in this country. 
For those reasons, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to table this amendment and hope my colleagues will support it. I say that with all due respect for my colleague from Arkansas. We have worked together on a number of different issues. I have great respect for him. I enjoy his company and service. I just have a fundamental disagreement with what this amendment would do. I think it would be dangerous to what has otherwise been a very ennobling effort and one that ought to enjoy broad-based support here. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Very briefly, my colleague from New York is here and I will yield to him, but I want to make a quick comment on the modification offered by our colleague from Arkansas to his amendment. 
Certainly, while I appreciate the attempt here to lessen the burden of contacting every single person and property owner of this amendment, still I respectfully suggest that it has some major flaws. 
No. 1, it still suggests that Congress knows better about the wishes of local communities. We have a fundamental disagreement about that. As my colleague, Senator Bumpers, said--and I am confident my colleague from New York will agree--this is community originated. The idea that we would have the say over what our local communities want is contrary to the steps we have taken in the last few years. We have tried to strengthen our local communities in almost every process. 
No. 2, the consultation process suggests here that only private property owners be consulted for comment here. Obviously there are a lot of other interests here that would want to comment, beyond private property owners. What is suggested by the Executive order, you get broad-based comments, including private property owners. And if we adopt this language, the argument is you exclude in the process these other people. 
No. 3, the amendment says that we ought to define `river communities' as those that are 10 miles on either side; yet to make a case, if we exclude them from commenting here, as the amendment does by implication here, that, in my view, would be a mistake. 
Last, this amendment, underlying it all, presumes that the program is intended to be some large, costly bureaucratic effort. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is anything but that. It is designed to be just the opposite of that, to be a community-based effort here to recognize and designate the importance of the great rivers of this country. 
Certainly I appreciate that there are those who get concerned when they hear about Washington wanting to help, their abundance of good humor about Washington wanting to help. In this case, that is exactly what it is. It has been a wonderful inspiration, Mr. President, to see the communities come together all along these rivers and, in multi-States, sort of competing in a healthy way to be designated one of the 10 heritage rivers. 
As I said at the conclusion of my earlier remarks, we ought to be applauding this. This is a worthwhile effort here. There is nothing sinister about it. There is nothing underhanded, no secret agenda, no mandates, regulations, or dollars associated with this in any way. Yet I suggest here, by this amendment, when you start reading it, I can see someone saying, `Look, I wish to comment on this, but I didn't get a chance to comment,' and you are in a lawsuit before you know it because we have adopted laws here that say that anyone who wishes to comment ought to be able to comment. 
Once you start doing that, you are inviting people to suggest otherwise--`I wasn't heard,' `I should have heard,' `I wish to comment, you didn't give me a chance.' I don't think we want to go down that road. 
With all due respect to my colleague from Arkansas, I know my colleague from New York, when he completes his remarks, will move to table this amendment. I will join him in that motion and urge my colleagues to support us in that effort. 
I thank Senator D'Amato and Senator Bumpers for their leadership and hope we can reject this amendment and by doing so recognize the important effort that the President has undertaken as he did in mentioning this effort in the State of the Union Message. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me begin by expressing my appreciation to our colleagues who rejected the proposal to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts in its entirety by a vote of 23 to 77. I think it was a good vote and a strong vote, one in which the Senate can take legitimate pride. I think that vote expresses the feelings of most of us here that the National Endowment for the Arts has been a very successful agency that has made a significant contribution, and continues to do so, to the vitality, health, well-being, and cultural heritage of our country. 
I know it has been said that there have been examples cited of where NEA grants or subgrants or subcontracts over the years, from time to time have been given that have supported or produced or been involved with some productions of art that have been distasteful to many people in this country. I am not here to argue the merits or demerits of those particular cases. In fact, in several instances, I, too, was sort of stunned that certain productions were provided with that kind of financing and backing. 
But I think it is important for everybody to understand and to put this into context, if we can. As I understand it now, since the creation of the National Endowment for the Arts, going back more than a quarter of a century ago, there have been over 100,000 grants that have been extended by the NEA. Of that 100,000, I am told, if you take all the controversial grants that have been given, the number is around 40 or 45 maybe. That, many would argue, goes beyond the ones that were the most controversial, which number in the single digits. I wanted to put that into perspective.

Mr. DODD. If I can just finish my remarks, I will be glad to yield at that time. 
The reason I cite those statistics is I think it is important, as we look at these agencies, that we keep this in context. No agency is perfect. There have been questionable grants given by the Housing Administration, by the Defense Department, and by the Commerce Department. In fact, I would match up the total amount of grants given by the NEA, those that are controversial or distasteful, and compare that with almost any other agency of the Federal Government and compare their track record in terms of cases where there has been fraud, abuse, or waste of millions of dollars. 
So nobody is standing here suggesting perfection at all. What we are arguing about is whether or not there is a legitimate purpose in having a National Endowment for the Arts, a federally chartered agency that tries to express the importance of the cultural contribution of the arts. I have often said to students in my State, or elsewhere, when this issue comes up--I think 
almost every grade school student can tell you the name of the artist who painted the roof of the Sistine Chapel. But I defy anybody to tell you who the Pope was at that time, or to name the Emperor of Rome. We don't remember the political figures throughout history, but artists have given us a definition, a signature, in many cases, of a generation or a time. Certainly, we have seen that in our country. 
We define our own heritage by literature, art, and music. To have our Government, in a sense, speak to that and try to provide guidance, assistance, and support for areas of the country that would not otherwise get that assistance, I think is something we ought to build upon and perpetuate. We build stadiums for sports with taxpayers' money. These stadiums today can cost $100 or $115 million to house 30,000 or 40,000 people to watch a sporting event. The entire budget we are talking about here for the National Endowment for the Arts is $100 million for all 50 States, to support our cultural activities. 
There has been a tremendous burst and blossoming of activities in the last 30 years in this country in the arts area. The number of nonprofit theaters has grown from fifty-six 30 years ago to over 400 in the country today. Orchestras have quadrupled in number, to over 200 in our Nation. Public arts agencies in small towns and cities have climbed to over 3,000 in the last 30 years. 
Yet, today, we see another attempt here to try, in one way or another, to get rid of the agency, to either vote it out of existence or, with all due respect, to block grant the money to eliminate it. We also know that this very agency has been the one which has served as the impetus, the spark, if you will, that has aided in the flourishing of the arts we have seen over these past three decades. 
With a deep commitment and a meager beget, the NEA has provided vital support to States, local communities, schools, artistic and cultural institutions, artists, and others for over 30 years. 
While always limited, these dollars do make a difference. It is hard to leverage out of a block grant, if you will, the kind of private contributions NEA has been able to generate. So by removing the kind of programs that we have seen here and leaving things up to sort of the political vagaries, we leave this commitment that we have made over the years in great, great jeopardy. 
Currently, 35 percent of the NEA's budget flows directly to the States--in effect, a block grant, if you will. I understand that the States deserve a role, but it needs to be a partnership with the Federal Government. The success of the NEA is rooted, obviously, in its national presence--once that is lost, I think we all lose in this country. 
Why is the Federal leadership role important? First, I happen to believe that Federal leadership allows better access to the arts for all Americans. It assures all Americans, regardless of income or geography, that they will have access to the arts. Grants allow quality orchestras and theater groups to travel throughout the country. The NEA helps communities with few resources to develop local talent through exposure to operas, theaters, and orchestra groups. 
Second, the NEA develops public-private partnerships that work. NEA grants, as I said a moment ago, help raise and leverage private dollars. Also, it is the prestige of an NEA grant that, on average, attracts money from other public and private funding sources. There is no guarantee that these same sources will risk supporting a festival or exhibit sponsored by an unknown State art council with no track record and without the stature of the NEA. In essence, NEA grants raise money; block grants do not. 
Third, support for programs with a national impact is a goal and commitment of the NEA and can only be forwarded by an organization with resources and the kind of clout and prestige of 
a Federal agency. It puts us on record, as a nation, that we stand and support these efforts. 
The NEA supports such nationally important work as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, or public television shows; these are national in scope not State by State, or community by community. We lose that if we don't have a national focus and direction. 
National studies into the importance of arts education can be lost. Supporting American artists that represent the United States as a nation in cultural festivals overseas are supported by the NEA. Who is going to do this if we, in fact, distribute the resources around the country and lose the national presence of the National Endowment for the Arts? 
The National Endowment for the Arts dollars go to regional projects--not just State and local ones--such as exhibiting the traditional folk arts of the Delaware Valley. Only the NEA, as a fully funded Federal agency, can garner the resources and provide the leadership for such nationally important work. 
Fourth, NEA dollars receive economic returns. These dollars create $37 billion in national economic activity, and $1 billion alone in my home State of Connecticut. Grants spur economic activity throughout the country. NEA grants generate tourism, stimulate business development, drive urban renewal and contribute to our Nation's economic vitality. Over 1.3 million jobs are supported by the arts. 
Finally, the NEA is a leader. The NEA provides cultural leadership for the Nation in such areas as education, crime prevention initiatives, city design, public arts, and preservation of the Nation's cultural heritage. 
By giving the majority of funds to the States, by cutting out the so-called middleman here in Washington, you are not helping, necessarily, the local artist, the local orchestra, or the local theater. In many cases, I suggest that you are actually hurting them. 
The NEA is the keystone here. Once removed, I think we all lose. 
Mr. President, the arts adds to our culture, to our Nation and our economy. I believe it is time that we look for a source of funding, in addition to Federal funds, to maintain the NEA's vital role. 
Our colleague from Alaska, Senator Stevens, has a proposal--a sense-of-the-Senate resolution--that we conduct some extensive hearings in the coming Congress to look at ways in which we might supplement the Federal funding for the NEA. It is time we do more to ensure the future viability of the NEA and the NEH. 
I am looking at a way in which we might get beyond the debate, and create a true endowment to supplement federal funds. I suggest looking into an innovative way to create this true endowment. I propose tapping revenue from a copyright extension to fund this true endowment. My idea is to extend, or rather to terminate the copyright period--whatever it may be, 50 70, or 90 years--that there be a period of say 20 years after that period in which the Government would auction off these copyrights. Individuals would bid on the copyrights. And the resources that came in from the bids would support a national arts endowment, a true endowment. But this would allow one generation of artists supporting future generations; in a sense, a true endowment. 
This is no endowment. I don't know why we call this a National Endowment for the Arts. It is not an endowment. It is an appropriations that we have year in and year out. The idea of a true endowment is not a perfect one at all. But it would be a way of us getting away, if you will, from the constant battle of appropriations to a way of having the arts in effect generate revenues. 
You may not get much immediately. But I suspect with all the technology that is being developed--the preservation, the ability to preserve works of art and many art forms emerging--that in the 21st century, long after all of us are gone, there might be a substantial amount of revenues that would be generated to support arts activities in the country. 
I raise the idea of a true endowment as a mere suggestion and I hope the Senate will look into the suggestion. It is time to endow the NEA and the NEH with a future and secure a national cultural endowment for generations to come. 
With that, I thank my colleagues for their patience in listening. But I know my colleague from Arkansas wanted to raise a question. I would be glad to at least try to respond.

<TEXT>
Mr. DODD. If my colleague would give me a chance to respond to the question, he raises the issue in the committees. He is not 
just raising it here on the floor. 
First, let me--I should have mentioned these in my remarks--comment here. I happen to believe that Jane Alexander has done a brilliant job at NEA--a remarkable individual, truly a national treasure. I recall the specific questions being raised about these issues. Certainly legitimate questions should be raised about how well an agency functions, whether or not we are getting much for the dollar for the purposes intended, or how much gets consumed by administrative costs. I think that is a legitimate question raised in ways in which we make an agency function better. Certainly we have seen this administration focus a great deal of its attention on so-called `reinvention of Government'--trying to streamline 180,000 fewer jobs at the Federal level, and fewer pages of Federal regulations. I think we all applaud that. 
I think it is a legitimate issue to look to see how we can make this agency perform better so that the American people will be the greater beneficiary, if you will, of the role of and the purpose of the NEA. But I would respectfully say to my colleague from Arkansas, as legitimate as those questions are, it seems to me that we ought not to try to eliminate in effect, through either block grant or total elimination, a Federal agency that has played such a critical role in giving national voice, as I said earlier, to the arts efforts, not to mention regional aspects, and the like. My fear is that, of course, by doing this through a block grant we would achieve just that--rather than an appropriate examination of how we can make the NEA work better, respond better, reduce its overhead costs so that more of those dollars will actually reach the artists, the communities, and the artistic efforts that we all would like to see happen. That is my concern here. We seem to be saying that no matter what you try to do, there is nothing that could be done here--that there is no way whatsoever to make this agency work better. I believe there are ways. I think Jane Alexander has certainly demonstrated that over the last several years under her leadership. 
So, I urge that, rather than discarding in a sense de facto--that would be the result here--with all due respect the NEA, we ought to look at ways in which the Senator might suggest how we can improve the NEA's performance rather than certainly suggesting its elimination. 
My colleague I see may have another question.

Mr. DODD. Second, I will conclude my remarks so others may have a chance to speak on this issue. In the reauthorization bill, which passed 14 to 4 by the Labor and Human Resources Committee, we adopted an amendment by our colleague that codifies the inspector general's recommendations that the Senator from Arkansas has identified before the committee today. 
So that the suggestions that are being made are ones that we think ought to be made a part of making NEA perform better. That is a legitimate function of a congressional committee--to examine all of our agencies to determine how they can function better. We did that pretty overwhelmingly in the committee. 
I commend my colleague for the amendment and the suggestion that codified those ideas. 
Second, Mr. President, administrative costs were lower at the agency when, frankly, the appropriations were higher. You shrink a budget down and, of course, if you are trying to maintain a programmatic level, what can happen is you find your percentage costs rise with the shrinkage of dollars, so that more and more of it gets eaten up in administration. When we actually appropriated more for the NEA, those administrative costs were a lower percentage of the overall budget. Audit findings were from a group of grants recommended by the staff of the NEA for audit because of concerns about the grant administration, and they were not randomly selected, I might point out as well. 
At any rate, Mr. President, just to make the final point on this from my perspective here, I think we ought to be celebrating the success of the agency. To have had 100,000 grants in 30 years with 40 controversial ones, I defy any other Federal agency to have a track record even remotely close to that record. Any other agency that provides grants to anyone, where they have had only 40 that fall into the category of controversial, that is a remarkable record and one I think we ought to applaud. We ought to be celebrating the National Endowment for the Arts and its contribution to our country and what it has stimulated, what it has brought to enrich our heritage, our culture, our time. 
Someone was pointing out to me earlier today there was a great debate in the Congress over whether or not we ought to accept the library of Thomas Jefferson when he offered it to the United States. Of course, the successor of that it is the Library of Congress, but it was the Jefferson library that was offered. The debate was a raging debate, and some suggested we only ought to accept the Jefferson library if we extracted from it any books which spoke about atheism or other questions which were not mainstream or popular or certainly rejected the values of our society as a whole. It was a relatively close vote, but that idea was rejected and we bought the entire Jefferson library. Today, I think our Library of Congress and the contribution that Thomas Jefferson made is something all of us applaud. 
We might find it even somewhat amusing today to have heard there was that kind of debate. I would suggest today that even with these highly controversial performances that people do not like, that offend them, we can focus on that if we want, but why not focus as well on the over 100,000 grants that have enriched our society, have brought a great wealth to this Nation, opportunities to people in areas of this Nation that never would have had that benefit. 
My hope is that when our colleagues vote on this particular amendment, they will be mindful of that contribution, of this great success and of the great fortune we have as a Nation to have someone of Jane Alexander's abilities and background and qualities to help lead this agency, as sensitive as she is, listening to the concerns of any Member who cares to have her time in how to make this agency work better. I hope we would keep that in mind as we cast our votes, so future generations look back on this time and say that in this Congress at the close of the 20th century the Senate insisted, a majority of us here, to keep the National Endowment for the Arts, to prepare for the 21st century and to leave a legacy of riches, of cultural riches. We lose that, Mr. President, if we abandon this agency and turn this into a 
block grant. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate the great city of Stamford, Connecticut, and Mayor Dannel Malloy, for having been ranked on the Children's Environmental Index as one of the most `kid-friendly' cities in the United States. Normally we consider the number 13 to be an unlucky number, but Stamford ranked number 13 of 219 cities in the nation on the quality of life for its children. Stamford was also ranked second in the nation in the education category which included student-teacher ratio and drop-out rate. This index, measured by the organization Zero Population Growth (ZPG), is the sixth in a series of bi-annual studies used to focus attention on the quality of life in the nation's largest cities. It is the third index which directly addresses the social and physical environment of children, measuring such areas as infant mortality, teen pregnancy, childhood poverty, high school drop-out rates, air quality, and crime rates. 
Mr. President, I was recently appointed by Minority Leader Tom Daschle to chair the Senate Democratic Strike Force for Kids named `Right Start 2000'. The purpose of this strike force is to develop constructive ways for us in Washington to best address the educational, health, and safety needs of America's children in the first six years of life. It is very clear from this index that we have much to learn from many of our Nation's cities. Clearly Stamford and other cities are taking bold and innovative steps to nurture our Nation's children. 
The children of today are the leaders of the next millennium. As such, it is critical that we ensure they grow up in surroundings which protect, nurture, educate, and care for them. Stamford has shown its willingness to invest the resources necessary to produce the next generation of leaders. We can only hope that this index will give the impetus to other cities to focus upon what is really critical for our future, healthy and happy children today. 
The road toward a better future for our kids will be a collective effort on the part of parents, schools, religious institutions, community, State, and national leaders. But this effort will be made easier in an environment where groups and individuals work in partnership with one another. I am delighted to know that this work is going on in my home State of Connecticut, and I particularly congratulate Mayor Malloy and all of the people of Stamford for their achievements on behalf of Stamford's children.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague from Vermont, the chairman of the committee. 
Let me begin these brief remarks by commending all of our colleagues on the Labor and Human Resources Committee. This has been a long process, 2 1/2 to 3 years. The Presiding Officer is a member of this committee as well and all have worked very hard, I think, to bring a bill which I think most would agree is a very good bill. 
There obviously still are some issues that will have to be resolved, but this has been a very fine product that has been assembled by both Democrats and Republicans for the first time in several decades of reforming the Food and Drug Administration and the processes by which we bring important pharmaceutical products and medical devices to patient groups and individuals across this country in an efficient, safe, and expeditious fashion. 
Let me begin as well by thanking our colleagues for their overwhelming support earlier today of the cloture motion to proceed with this bill. Mr. President, 94 Senators, of both parties, loudly and clearly told us they are ready to move forward to reauthorize PDUFA and begin debating the other critical reforms this bill contains. 
There is no Federal agency with a more direct or significant impact on the lives of the American people than the Food and Drug Administration. The foods that we serve our family, the medicines we take when we are sick, even the drugs we give our pets are all approved and monitored by the Food and Drug Administration. We must not lose the opportunity that we have before the Senate today to enact legislation that ensures that the FDA has the authority it needs to bring safe and effective products to the American people quickly, efficiently and safely. 
I again thank both Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their perseverance on this issue. Time after time they have been willing to return to the bargaining table after many others would have just walked away. With open minds and good faith they have extensively negotiated this bill line by line. 
Mr. President, we have now come to a point where issues on which Members were previously completely polarized--third-party review of medical devices, off-label dissemination of information, health claims for food products, the number of clinical trials needed for drug approval, and just today, national uniformity of cosmetics--we have now reached agreement. 
I don't know that any of us would have thought unanimity possible on these provisions even a month or two ago. Yet here we are, this afternoon on this day, with full agreement on all but a handful of issues, or less. 
I know we have a better bill for all the arduous negotiations that have occurred. As an example of how far we have come, let me just briefly describe third-party review of medical devices. The bill would expand the pilot program currently administered by the FDA. This is a program, I should note, that is supported by the FDA as a way to make more efficient use of its resources. 
In last year's debate on this issue, which many may recall as being one of the more acrimonious, we were told that this provision was a nonstarter, no room for compromise, subject closed. 
This year, I am pleased to say a spirit of bipartisanship and compromise has prevailed. Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Coats, the Presiding Officer, worked diligently to draft language that ensures that higher risk devices are not inappropriately included in this pilot program and that strong conflict of interest protections are in place. 
Late last week, again on an issue that appeared unresolved, national uniformity for cosmetics, we have reached agreement. Senator Gregg of New Hampshire has offered what I think is a very reasonable compromise. In the area of packaging and labeling, States can continue to regulate where the FDA has not acted. Conflicting State requirements that could confuse consumers will be removed. But where the FDA has not chosen to act, where it does not have either the manpower nor the authority to protect the public, States can still play their historic role in regulating cosmetics. 
This is the kind of effort, Mr. President, made over and over again on this bill--some 30 times just since the markup 2 months ago that we have made improvements in this legislation. A great many of us take pride in the product that we have created --a bill that would speed lifesaving drugs and devices to patients and that clearly retains the FDA as the undisputed arbiter of the safety and effectiveness of the products. 
I will speak about some of the positive reforms contained 
in this bill, as well. 
At the heart of this bill is the 5-year reauthorization of PDUFA, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, a piece of legislation remarkable for the fact that there is unanimous agreement that it really works. PDUFA has set up a system of user fees which drug companies pay to the FDA. These fees have enabled the agency to hire more staff. As a result, drug approval times have been cut almost in half, getting new and lifesaving therapies to patients more quickly. 
In addition, by improving the certainty and clarity of the product review process, S. 830 encourages U.S. companies to continue to develop and manufacture their products in the United States, not an insignificant matter. The legislation emphasizes collaboration early on between the FDA and industry during the product development and product approval phases. This will prevent misunderstandings about agency expectations and we think should result in quicker development of approval times. 
Mr. President, in addition, S. 830 establishes or expands upon several mechanisms to provide patients and other consumers with greater access to information and lifesaving products. For example, the legislation will give individuals with life-threatening illnesses greater access to information about the location of ongoing clinical trials of drugs. 
Based on a bill originally championed by Senators Snowe of Maine and Dianne Feinstein of California, I offered an amendment in committee, which I was pleased to see adopted, to expand the existing AIDS database to include trials for all serious or life-threatening diseases. 
Experimental trials offer hope for patients who have not benefited from treatments currently on the market. Currently, patients' ability to access experimental treatments is dependent on their spending large amounts of time and energy contacting individual drug manufacturers just to discover the existence of trials. 
Mr. President, this is not a burden that we should place on individuals already struggling with chronic and debilitating diseases. This database will provide one-stop shopping for patients seeking information on the location and the eligibility criteria for studies of promising treatments. 
Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that this legislation incorporates the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, legislation originally introduced by our former colleague from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, and now cosponsored by myself and Senator DeWine of Ohio, along with Senator Kennedy, Senator Mikulski, Senator Hutchinson, Senator Collins, and Senator Cochran. 
This provision, Mr. President, addresses the problem of the lack of information about how drugs work on children, a problem that just last month President Clinton recognized publicly as a national crisis. 
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only one-fifth of all drugs on the market have been tested for their safety and effectiveness on children. This legislation provides a fair and reasonable market incentive for drug companies to make the extra effort needed to test their products for use by children. 
It gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to request pediatric clinical trials for new drug applications and for drugs currently on the market. If the manufacturer successfully conducts the additional research, 6 extra months of market exclusivity would be given. 
I recognize that there are a few matters unresolved in this bill despite the best efforts of all involved, and we will need to hold votes on those issues. One issue, which I plan to discuss further when we debate the bill this week, involves section 404 of the bill, which relates to the FDA's medical devices. This provision, the so-called labeling claims provision, clarifies current law by stating that while reviewing a device for approval, FDA should look at safety and efficacy issues raised by the use for which the product was developed and for which it was marketed. 
Again, this is current law. Unfortunately, in a few instances the FDA has inappropriately expanded the scope of its review by requiring manufacturers to submit data on potential uses of the product. Some have raised concerns that under this provision a manufacturer could propose a very narrowly worded label for a device and that the FDA would be barred from asking for information on other obvious uses. 
I don't believe this is the case. The FDA retains its current authority to not approve a device if features of the device raise new questions of safety and efficacy. Clearly, if a bad actor device manufacturer attempted to get a misleading label past the FDA, the agency would have full authority to disapprove the product. 
Again, I urge, on this matter, that some common ground be sought to see if we cannot resolve this, but I do believe the present legislation is more than adequate to protect the concerns that have been raised about a use for a device beyond what its intended purpose would be. 
I was pleased to join Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the 
committee, as the first Democratic cosponsor of this bill. I thank him again for the hard work and long hours that he and his staff, as well as Senator Kennedy, Senator Mikulski, Senator Wellstone, Senator Coats, Senator Gregg and others, have contributed. 
Mr. President, this has been a long process, and while there are still some outstanding issues, I think this committee deserves a great deal of credit for having been open to the suggestions of others. There are about 50-some-odd amendments that are kicking around that may be offered. I don't know how many will actually survive the germaneness test when they are raised, but I hope, for those who are bringing up new matters here that we have not had a chance to look at, that they would reserve those unless there is an overwhelming need for them. In many cases, if the matters had been brought before the committee earlier, we might have been able to handle them. 
We have a few days left to get the bill done. PDUFA goes out of existence on September 30. We have been 2 1/2 years at this now. My hope is we will not delay this to such a degree that we lose a historic opportunity to make a difference. When it takes 14 to 17 years to get some cancer treatments approved, there is something fundamentally wrong with that kind of a process. We ought to be able to make it far more efficient than that and also be able to provide people with the safety that they demand. It is a wonderfully encouraging thing in this country, when we think how many places we go and how many products we ingest and how many products we apply to our bodies and to our children and families, that we have a high sense of confidence that when we do that, it is safe and, by and large, efficient and effective. We don't want to lose that. 
We also believe in this day and age with all the technology available to us that we ought to be able to not give up on safety or efficacy and be able to move that process forward. 
I thank my colleague from Vermont for yielding.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in order to pay a special tribute to Ambassador Raul E. Granillo Ocampo, until recently the Government of Argentina's Ambassador to the United States. Ambassador Ocampo left Washington last month to return to Buenos Aires and another challenging assignment from President Menem. 
During his nearly 4 years in Washington, Ambassador Ocampo did a superb job representing his country's interests. He understood well what it takes to be an effective diplomat in Washington. Not only did he develop close working relationships with the State Department and the White House on matters of mutual concern to the United States and Argentina, he also made a special effort to establish close ties with the United States Congress. 
The United States-Argentine relationship has never been better. I believe that Ambassador Ocampo can take a good deal of the credit for this. Certainly issues between our two countries would arise from time to time. That is only natural. But, thanks to Ambassador Ocampo's diplomatic skills, such issues were never allowed to undermine our fundamental friendship and mutual respect. 
Those of us who had the privilege of knowing Ambassador Ocampo, quickly recognized and appreciated his special talents. So too did President Menem. Hence, it came as no real surprise when in July, President Menem announced the appointment of Ambassador Ocampo to the post of Minister of Justice--a very important position in his Cabinet. That is why Ambassador Ocampo has returned to Argentina. 
Knowing something about Ambassador Ocampo's background, it makes perfect sense to me that he would be selected to become Minister of Justice. Not only does he have a law degree from the National University of La Plata, a master's degree in Comparative International Law from Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX; and a doctorate in law from the National University of Buenos Aires. He has also practiced law extensively, served as a judge on the Superior Court of the Province of La Rioja, and as the president, or chief judge, for that court for 2 years. 
I for one am only grateful that I had the opportunity to get to know Ambassador Ocampo personally during his tenure in Washington. Thanks to him, I have a much better understanding and appreciation of the complexities of the relations between our two countries and of importance of working to maintain those close ties. 
Before the August recess, I was able to personally bid farewell to Ambassador Ocampo and his charming wife, Chini. However, I also wanted to say a more formal farewell to him as well. I particularly wanted him to know that we in the U.S. Senate have been enriched by his presence in Washington over these last number of years. 
Finally, Mr. President, it is only fitting that as we say goodby to an old friend, we also prepare to welcome a new one. President Menem has chosen as Ambassador Ocampo's replacement, His Excellency Diego Ramiro Guelar, who just recently presented his credentials to President Clinton. 
Although I have not yet had the opportunity to meet Ambassador Guelar, I understand that he is both an experienced diplomat and an experienced politician--he has held a number of ambassadorial posts and has been a Representative in the Argentine Congress. I look forward to meeting Ambassador Guelar in the very near future, and to working with him as I did with his predecessor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my colleagues for their overwhelming support last week for cloture on the motion to proceed with this bill. Some 89 Senators very loudly and very clearly told us last week that they were ready to move forward to reauthorize PDUFA and to begin debating the other critical reforms this bill contains. 
There is no Federal agency with a more direct and significant impact on the lives of the American people than the Food and Drug Administration. The foods we serve our family, the medicines we take when we're sick, even the drugs we give our pets, are all approved and monitored by the FDA. 
We must not lose the opportunity that we have before us now to enact legislation that ensures the FDA has the authorities it needs to bring safe and effective products to the American people quickly and efficiently. 
I would like to again thank both Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their perseverance on this issue. Time after time they have been willing to return to the bargaining table after many others would have just walked away. With open minds and in good faith, they've extensively negotiated this bill, line by line. 
We have come to a point where issues on which Members were previously completely polarized--third party review of medical devices, off-label dissemination of information, health claims for food products, the number of clinical trials needed for drug approval, and just today national uniformity of cosmetics--we've now reached agreement. 
I don't know that any of us would have thought unanimity possible on these provisions even 2 months ago--yet here we are with full agreement on all but a handful of issues. 
I know we have a better bill for all of the arduous negotiations that have occurred. 
Just as an example of how far we've come, let's talk about third party review of medical devices. The bill would expand the pilot program currently administered by the FDA. 
This is a program, I should note, that is supported by the FDA as a way to make more efficient use of its resources. 
In last years debate, which many of you will remember as being much more acrimonious, we were told this provision was a nonstarter, no room to compromise, subject closed. 
This year, I am pleased to say, a spirit of bipartisanship and compromise prevailed. Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Coats worked diligently to draft language that ensures that higher risk devices aren't inappropriately included in this pilot program and that strong conflict of interest protections are in place. 
And just last night, again on an issue that appeared unresolvable--national uniformity for cosmetics, we have reached agreement. Senator Gregg has offered what I think is a very reasonable compromise. In the area of safety requirements, States can continue to regulate where the FDA has not acted. 
Conflicting State requirements that could confuse consumers will be removed. But where the FDA has not chosen to act, where it does not have either the manpower or the authority to protect the public, States can contain to play their historic role in regulating cosmetics. 
This is the kind of effort made over and over again on this bill--some 30 times just since markup 2 months ago we have made improvements to this bill. A great many of us take pride in the product that has been created--a bill that will speed lifesaving drugs and devices to patients and that clearly retains the FDA as the undisputed arbiter of the safety effectiveness of these products. 
Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment about some of the positive reforms contained in this bill. 
At the heart of this bill is the 5-year reauthorization of PDUFA, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act--a piece of legislation remarkable for the fact that there is unanimous agreement that it really works. 
PDUFA has set up a system of user fees which drug companies pay to the FDA. These fees have enabled the Agency to hire more staff. As a result, drug approval times have been cut almost in half, getting new and life-saving therapies to patients more quickly. 
In addition, by improving the certainty and clarity of the product review process, S. 830 encourages U.S. companies to continue to develop and manufacture their products in the United States. The legislation emphasizes collaboration early on between the FDA and industry during the product development and product approval phases. This will prevent misunderstandings about Agency expectations and should result in even quicker development and approval times. 
In addition, S. 830 establishes or expands upon several mechanisms to provide patients and other consumers with greater access to information and to life-saving products. 
For example, S. 830 will give individuals with life-threatening illness greater access to information about the location of on-going clinical trials of drugs. 
Based on a bill originally championed by Senators Snowe and Feinstein. I offered an amendment in committee, which I was pleased to see adopted, to expand an existing aids database to include trials for all serious or life-threatening diseases. 
Experimental trials offer hope for patients who have not benefited from treatments currently on the market. Currently, patients' ability to access experimental treatments is dependent upon their spending large amounts of time and energy contacting individual drug manufacturers just to discover the existence of trials. 
This is not a burden that we should place on individuals already struggling with chronic and debilitating diseases. This database will provide `one-stop-shopping' for patients seeking information on the location of and eligibility criteria for studies of promising treatments. 
Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that this bill incorporates the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, legislation originally introduced by our former colleague from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, and now cosponsored by myself and Senator DeWine, along with Senators Kennedy, Mikulski, Hutchinson, Collins, and Cochran. 
This provision addresses the problem of the lack of information about how drugs work on children, a problem that just last month President Clinton recognized publicly as a national crisis. 
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only one-fifth of all drugs on the market have been tested for their safety and effectiveness in children. This legislation provides a fair and reasonable market incentive for drug companies to make the extra effort needed to test their products for use by children. It gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to request pediatric clinical trials for new drug applications and for drugs currently on the market. If the manufacturer successfully conducts the additional research, 6 extra months of market exclusivity would be given. 
I recognize that there are few matters still unresolved on this bill despite the best efforts of all involved. And those we will need to simply address though the traditional process of holding votes on the issues. 
One issue, which I plan to discuss further when we debate the bill on Tuesday involves section 404 of the bill, which relates to the FDA's review of medical devices. This provision, the so-called labeling claims provision clarifies current law by stating that when reviewing a device for approval, FDA should look at safety and efficacy issues raised by the use for which the product was developed and for which it will be marketed. 
Again, this is current law. Unfortunately, in a few instances, the FDA has inappropriately expanded the scope of its review by requiring manufacturers to submit data on potential uses of product. 
Some have raised concerns that under this provision a manufacturer could propose a very narrowly worded label for a device and that the FDA would be barred from asking for information on other obvious uses. 
This is simply not the case. The FDA retains its current authority to not approve a device if based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, the labeling is false or misleading. Clearly, if a bad actor device manufacturer attempted to get a misleading label past the FDA, the Agency would have full authority to disapprove the product. 
I was pleased to join Senator Jeffords as the first Democratic cosponsor of this bill. I would thank him again for the hard work and long hours that he and his staff, as well, as Senator kennedy, Senator Mikulski, Senator Wellstone, Senator Coats, Senator Gregg, and others, have contributed. 
I look forward to further debate on and to joining my colleague next week in enacting this legislation.

Mr. DODD. Let me briefly commend our leader, the Democratic leader, for soliciting the support of the 44 others of us who make up this caucus, the Democratic caucus. There are 45 members of this caucus, and all 45 members have signed this letter urging the adoption of the legislation introduced by our colleague, John McCain, from the Republican side and Russ Feingold from our side. 
I think, as the leader has said, this is not a perfect bill. I have disagreements with it. I do not applaud every single dotted `i' and crossed `t,' nor do I assume anyone else does, but it is a common vehicle to embrace most of the positions we would like to see adopted as campaign finance reform. The fact that 100 percent of those of us on this side have joined in this letter, I think, is a strong indication of our commitment to this issue. 
It would not have happened had it not been for our leader on this side. I want to commend him publicly for his leadership on this issue as he has demonstrated in so many other areas and urge that his words be heeded and we try to get some additional sponsors here and see if we cannot bring this up.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to briefly say to my colleagues, we will vote in a few minutes on two nominees for the Federal district court bench, Janet Hall and Christopher Droney. 
Senator Lieberman and I have appeared before the Judiciary Committee on their behalf. I see our colleague from Alabama here on the floor, who is a member of that committee and who very graciously heard the two nominees. 
They are two very highly confident, very qualified nominees. Janet Hall has superlative work experience, both in government service and in private practice. She has worked in the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department from 1975 to 1979. She later joined one of the finest law firms in the State of Connecticut, Robinson and Cole, where she has been a partner since 1982. She has appeared before Federal, State, and appellate courts, and even the U.S. Supreme Court, and her work has focused primarily on complex commercial litigation. In short, she is a very, very fine nominee. 
She is a graduate of Mount Holyoke College and the New York University School of Law. She has received numerous awards and recognitions including Mount Holyoke's Alumnae Medal of Honor, and she has served on the Board of the Connecticut Bar Foundation since 1993. She also serves on the Parents' Advisory Committee of her hometown high school and has volunteered in numerous other activities in her community. 
She is a very fine lawyer, a very fine person, very community oriented, and she brings wonderful legal knowledge and expertise to this nomination. I am confident that my colleagues across political lines here will be very proud of their vote in casting it this afternoon for Janet Hall to be a district court judge in Connecticut. 
The other nominee is Christopher F. Droney. Some of our colleagues know Christopher Droney. He has been our U.S. attorney in Connecticut for the last 4 or 5 years and a very successful one. He is known as one of the leading U.S. attorneys in the country for his anticrime efforts, and in particular for fighting juvenile crime. 
I might point out that he also knows something about what it is like to be in elective office. He served as the mayor of West Hartford, CT, and did a wonderful job there. He is a graduate of the University of Connecticut Law School, where he was on the Law Review. He was named Citizen of the Year by the Connecticut District of the Boy Scouts of America, and he received the Distinguished Law Enforcement Award from the Hartford Police Union. He also received special recognition award from the Spanish-American Merchants Association. He is very community-oriented and very successful in his community activities. He is a member of the Federal Bar Council, a member of the St. Timothy Roman Catholic Church in his community, and very involved in the YMCA and YWCA in our State, as well. 
Again, given his background experience as a U.S. attorney, I think my colleagues can feel very, very proud, Mr. President, in casting a vote this afternoon to confirm the nomination of Christopher Droney, as well, to be a district court judge in Connecticut. I urge support for these nominees. I think they will do us all proud. The Senate can be proud of the work they will perform on behalf of all of us. I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I consider my role in making recommendations to the President on judicial nominees to be one of the most important parts of my job as a Senator. It is imperative that we fill these lifetime positions with the most able and talented individuals available. That is why I am very pleased that President Clinton chose to nominate Mr. Droney to serve on the Federal bench. 
Chris Droney is a man of strong character, and I believe that his skills and intellect will enable him to serve the country with honor and integrity as a Federal judge. Since 1993, Mr. Droney has served as the U.S. attorney for Connecticut. During his tenure, he has been well-received by the judiciary and law enforcement agencies and has played a key role in the State's crackdown on street gangs. The Justice Department's last evaluation of his office concluded that Mr. Droney is, and I quote, `strongly committed to the Department's law enforcement priorities and has demonstrated significant leadership in the law enforcement community, as witnessed by the remarkable cooperation among the law enforcement agencies through the District.' We are proud that the Justice Department has recognized what we in Connecticut already know: Chris Droney is an outstanding lawyer and public servant. 
Prior to becoming U.S. attorney, Mr. Droney was in private practice in Hartford specializing in civil litigation. He also served as mayor of West Hartford from 1985 to 1989, where he did an excellent job. 
He has been very active in a number of charitable organizations, and his community service has earned him several honors and awards. In particular, he was named Citizen of the Year by the Connecticut division of the Boy Scouts of America, and he received the Distinguished Law Enforcement Award from the Hartford Police Union. 
Christopher Droney is an honest, forthright, and intelligent individual, who is highly qualified to serve on the Federal bench. I am confident that he will serve Connecticut well as a district judge for many years to come, and I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support his nomination.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, Ms. Hall is one of the premier litigators in the State of Connecticut, and I know that her impressive work experience, both in Government service and in private practice, along with her intelligence and character, will enable her to become an excellent Federal judge. 
After working in the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department from 1975 to 1979, Ms. Hall joined the Hartford law firm of Robinson & Cole, where she has been a partner since 1982. Since returning to private practice, she has handled numerous matters before both Federal and State appellate courts, and her work has focused primarily on complex commercial litigation. 
Ms. Hall is respected throughout Connecticut's legal community for her intelligence and sense of fairness, but she is best known for her dedicated work ethic. More than one associate at her firm described her as the hardest working, most prepared lawyer that they had ever known. Not only does Ms. Hall push herself, but she also expects a lot from those around her. Her former secretary said that the only time that she was bored during 14 years of working with Ms. Hall was when she was on maternity leave with her third child. However, while Ms. Hall can be tough on others, she always demanded even more from herself. 
Part of me is actually relieved that I'm no longer an attorney in Connecticut, because I anticipate that trying a case before Ms. Hall would not be an easy day's work. 
Janet Hall is unquestionably an excellent attorney, but she is also a person of great character and integrity. While Ms. Hall always worked hard to fulfill her responsibilities at her firm, she always managed to keep her career in perspective, and her family was always her top priority. 
After successfully arguing a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, she was discussing the case with a group of associates. When asked to describe what was the most important thing to remember about arguing the case before the highest Court in the land, she said, `The most important thing was to bring my family.' 
In closing, Janet Hall is an honest, forthright, and intelligent individual, who is highly qualified to serve on the Federal bench, and all of my colleagues should be proud to vote in support of her nomination.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to the Webster Hose Volunteer Fire Co., which is celebrating 100 years of loyal service to the city of Ansonia, CT. 
Anyone familiar with the early days of the Webster Hose Co. can truly appreciate how much this unit has evolved during the past century. The Webster Co. started 100 years ago when 20 courageous individuals were authorized by the board of aldermen to undertake all fire-fighting duties for the city of Ansonia. This fledgling fire department was named the Webster Hose Co., in honor of Ansonia's mayor Erwin W. Webster, and in 1903 the name was changed to the Webster Hose Hook & Ladder Co. 
The number of firefighters quickly grew to 50, and these volunteers overcame many obstacles in order to serve the people of Ansonia. Perhaps their biggest handicap was the rudimentary firefighting equipment that was available to them. Their primary firefighting device was a 550-pound hand-drawn cart, equipped with a large hose. Manually transporting this cart through Ansonia's hilly terrain was difficult to say the least, and many early members of the Webster Co. suffered broken arms and legs as they miscalculated the number of people necessary to slow the vehicle down, or the direction it would take on a hill. To say that these early members had to go above and beyond the call of duty in performing their jobs would be a tremendous understatement. 
But thanks to the extraordinary efforts of these founding members and other members of the Webster Hose Co., this unit has survived and evolved into a modern fire department that is highly trained to save the lives and property of the people of Ansonia. 
In celebration of their centennial birthday, the Webster Hose Co. has been chosen to host the 114th Connecticut State Fireman's Convention. This convention will culminate in a parade of hundreds of firefighters through downtown Ansonia on Sunday, September 14, 1997. I am honored to have the opportunity to walk in this parade, and I hope that the day's activities will serve as a fitting tribute to not only Ansonia's firefighters, but to all the men and women of Connecticut who risk their own personal safety as they confront danger to safeguard the well-being of others. 
The men and women of the Webster Hose Co. exemplify the highest standard of community service. They also serve as role models for their long-standing commitment to their community. Some of the current Webster members are the direct descendants of the fire service's founding fathers, and it is refreshing to see this spirit of public service passed on from one generation to the next. Without these dedicated individuals, the city of Ansonia would be at a tremendous loss. 
I appreciate this opportunity to commend the Webster Hose Co. for a century of outstanding service, and I wish them well as they continue to serve their community in the years to come.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a remarkable public servant from my home State of Connecticut--Richard B. McCall, who this past month left the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles after 31 years of working as the head of its Handicapped Driver Training Program. 
The Connecticut DMV's Handicapped Driver Training Program is the only one in the country where a licensed state agency provides free driver training for the handicapped. It began in 1945, in order to meet the needs of disabled World War II veterans, and for more than five decades this program has helped handicapped residents of Connecticut to function as independent and productive members of society. No individual is more closely linked to this program and its long-term success than Dick McCall. 
Since taking charge of the program in 1966, Mr. McCall has personally helped to train more than 3,500 Connecticut residents with disabilities who now hold driver's licenses. He made sure that anyone who wanted to drive would receive an evaluation and have a fair chance to get a license. 
Performing his duties required great diligence, patience, and compassion. Mr. McCall would sometimes make as many as 50 trips to a trainee's house, while preparing him or her for a test. In addition, he made himself available to help his students at all times including nights and weekends. 
Dick McCall's attitude toward his job has been described as a one-man crusade to give people with disabilities an opportunity for equality and personal freedom. Mr. McCall recognized that the ability to drive brings with it the dignity of having a job or just being able to drive to the supermarket, library, or church. Dick McCall felt that, short of curing their disability, the greatest gift that he could give to these people was mobility and independence, and he worked tirelessly to help as many people as was humanly possible. 
While Dick McCall is ending his career with the DMV, he is by no means retiring from public service. He has taken a job with the Easter Seals, where he will continue working with people with disabilities. 
Too often, the work of people like Dick McCall goes unnoticed by society at large. However, the thousands of people whose lives have been touched by Dick McCall recognize the sacrifices that he has made in his life, and his work has earned him the nickname `Saint Richard.' I would like to personally commend him for his ongoing career of public service. He is truly an inspiration to all those people who have been fortunate enough to know him, and I wish him only the best in his future endeavors.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise today to commemorate the 75th birthday of one of the oldest and most respected companies in my home State--the Durham Manufacturing Co. of Durham, CT. Few companies ever enjoy such long-term success, but Durham Manufacturing has been able to thrive for so many years because it is committed not only to manufacturing excellence, but also to its workers and to its surrounding community. 
The Durham Manufacturing Co. was founded after a fire destroyed the factory for Merriman Manufacturing Co., which had been Durham's largest employer for decades. The residents of Durham were determined to keep their community together, and in 1922, the Durham Manufacturing Co. began operations out of a wooden barn. Durham Manufacturing specialized in the manufacture of tin-coated iron cash boxes and cash boxes with a handle and combination lock which were used to store insurance policies. 
During World War II, Durham Manufacturing adapted its production to meet the needs created by the war and became the leading supplier of first aid boxes to the Armed Forces. After the war, Durham saw many of its Government contracts expire, and unfortunately, in 1947, the wooden factory was destroyed by fire. 
While many companies would have folded up their tents under such adversity, there was never any doubt that the Durham Manufacturing Co. would continue. After the fire, the company took on a new direction as its focus shifted from custom contract work to developing proprietary product lines, which have evolved into their current product lines of first aid boxes, storage cabinets and bins, and office products. Today, their products are used throughout North America and Europe, and this company, which began operating out of a wooden barn, now has its own site on the World Wide Web. Clearly, the future of Durham Manufacturing appears even more promising than its past. 
It is only appropriate that Durham Manufacturing's current factory is located on Main Street, because theirs is an All-American success story. But while there is a Main Street in most every town in the country, companies like Durham Manufacturing have become all too rare--a business where generations of family members have worked to build not only a profitable company, but a prosperous community, as well. Companies like Durham Manufacturing represent the backbone of small cities all around this country, and it is important that we recognize and celebrate their longevity. 
Again, I would like to congratulate the Durham Manufacturing Co. on the occasion of their 75th birthday, and I wish many more years of continued prosperity.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce legislation to provide new support to needy college students struggling to balance their efforts in college with their role as parents. The CAMPUS--Child Care Access Means Parents in School Act will support the participation of low-income parents in college by supporting campus-based child care. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Snowe and Senator Kennedy. 
The stereotypical college student is no longer an 18-year-old high school graduate. Increasingly, nontraditional students--older, with children and various job and life experiences--are filling the ranks of college classes. These students recognize the importance of college to future success. 
But these students face new barriers unheard of in earlier times. Many are parents and must provide for their children while in school. Campus-based child care is a vital necessity for parents attending college. It is conveniently located, available during the right hours, and of high quality and lower cost. Unfortunately, it is unavailable at many schools. Even where programs exist, they are often difficult to access, particularly for low-income parents who struggle with the costs. 
In the wake of welfare reform, new pressures are also coming to bear on low-income student parents. With the work requirements of the welfare reform bill, it will become increasingly difficult for students who are low-income parents to obtain Federal child care funds. States are likely to shift these funds to support welfare recipients returning to work, rather than to support low-income parents pursuing higher education. This outcome is particularly perverse given the impact of obtaining a college education on family earnings over time. Studies are clear: public assistance recipients who attend college are significantly more likely to leave welfare permanently. 
This bill will offer new hope to these students. It will provide support to campus-based child care programs serving low-income parents. Colleges can apply for these 3-year grants to assist the institution in supporting or establishing a campus-based child care program serving the needs of their low-income students. Funds will be targeted to institutions serving low-income students and programs focused on meeting these needs. 
Mr. President, this is a modest measure that will make a major difference to students. I am hopeful that it can be considered and enacted as part of the Higher Education Act which we will consider later this year. I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this important measure forward.

Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Vermont. 
Mr. President, I urge our colleagues to vote to invoke cloture on this. But let me say at the outset here I want to commend our colleagues, and particularly my colleague from Massachusetts on this matter. He has labored for many, many years on FDA legislation. And he brings up an issue here regarding the cosmetics issue which will certainly be the subject of debate and has been the subject of debate in our committee over the last 2 1/2 years. In the most recent round of markups--we have been through a couple markups--the bill has had pretty substantial bipartisan support coming out of the committee. I think our vote was something like 14 to 4 in the last markup. 
This is an important piece of legislation. September 30 is coming. We have to reauthorize PDUFA. This is the first time we have been able to deal with FDA in a way that will not only guarantee that we will have a quicker response on these applications, but also a safe and efficient and effective response for the consumers, the patient groups of this country. 
This is a very important piece of legislation. I commend my colleague from Vermont, the chairman of the committee, for his leadership on this. The committee has worked very, very hard on this, my colleague from Indiana and others. We have had some very difficult issues over the last 2 1/2 years to try to reach compromise on and resolve them. And we have, by and large, with the exception of this one issue which is a great testament to the efforts of the members of the committee and the staffs that have worked on this. 
But I think it is time now that we bring the bill to the floor and try to leave it up to the Members themselves to resolve any outstanding issues that we have or, hopefully, over the next coming days, to achieve a compromise so we can avoid a kind of battle here on the floor over one or two remaining issues. 
Mr. President, I urge that we move forward on this. We have done a good job I think in the committee. It is not uncommon for there to be an outstanding issue. I urge the invoking of cloture.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my views on this historic moment as we offer the American people a balanced budget for the first time in almost 30 years. Mr. President, this agreement is truly a remarkable accomplishment for both President Clinton and Members of Congress, and it is a well-deserved victory for the American people. This means less debt for our children's generation, lower interest rates for families seeking to buy a car or a home, and a more vibrant economy for businesses to expand and create jobs. 
This moment must not be viewed in isolation because, in many respects, the victory we claim today stands on the shoulders of the progress we have made to reduce the deficit over the past few years. 
Let's give credit where credit is due. In 1990, President Bush put this country above his party and above his own political ambitions by endorsing a plan that lowered the deficit by $500 billion. It was wildly unpopular in his own party because it raised taxes on affluent Americans. But it was the right thing to do. President Bush's efforts on behalf of his country should be remembered and commended. 
When President Clinton came into office, he, too, stepped up to the challenge of combating the deficit. He proposed a far-reaching economic plan in 1993--more appropriately called the balanced budget plan of 1993--and it was enacted into law without a single Republican vote. 
President Clinton's balanced budget plan, which I supported, has reduced the deficit by more than 75 percent from $290 billion in 1992 to an estimated $67 billion this year. That $67 billion represents less than 1 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, the best we've seen since Harry Truman's presidency. We have now seen four consecutive years of deficit reduction, something that has not occurred since before the Civil War. 
And our economy is only getting stronger as a result of what we did in 1993. The unemployment rate is at 5 percent, representing the lowest level in 24 years. There have been 12.5 million new jobs created in these past 4 1/2 years of the Clinton administration. That's more than any prior administration. Home ownership has increased from 63.7 to 65.4 percent--the highest percentage on record. Median family income is up $1,600 since 1993, representing the fastest growth since the Johnson administration. And the stock market continues to break records, growing from 3,200 to 8,000, the fastest growth rate since World War II. The list goes on and on. 
Clearly, Mr. President, we no longer hear the voices that predicted that President Clinton's plan in 1993 would not balance the budget, but instead would cause a recession, raise interest rates, and put American families out of work. Those voices of opposition have been drowned out by our overwhelming record of successes. 
And without this tremendous record of progress, we could never have what we have today--the first time in a generation that our government will not run a deficit. 
The underlying bill represents the first tax cut in 16 years. It provides much-needed tax relief for working American families. The 1981 and 1986 tax cuts, which I voted against and which set the Reagan economic program in motion, blew a hole in the deficit and left us with an astronomical national debt. By contrast, this bill promotes fiscal responsibility, sustains balance, and is the most progressive economic package since the Lyndon Johnson package in the 1960's. 
Mr. President, I am particularly pleased with the child tax credit included in this budget agreement. Because of the efforts of President Clinton and a number of my colleagues in Congress, the child tax credit will be expanded to cover 7.5 million more children from lower income working families than would have been covered under the congressional leadership's original plan. In my State alone, upwards of 692,000 families will be eligible for this credit--almost 80 percent of families in my State. 
We succeeded in making this credit largely refundable against income and payroll taxes, benefiting 27 million families with 45 million children. Clearly, Mr. President, this is great news for the millions of families in America who, although they work very hard, still struggle just to make ends meet. 
Mr. President, this bill clearly reflects our commitment to expanding educational opportunity, as it is the largest investment in higher education since the GI bill in 1945. 
There are few issues more critical to American families than education. I think we can all agree that unless we tap and nurture the talents and energies of all our people, we won't be able to meet the challenges of the 21st century. This budget agreement recognizes this by providing American families with more than $35 billion in tax relief for education. 
The bill before us today provides increased funding for Head Start, provides the largest Pell grant increase in two decades, includes community service loan forgiveness, and allows students to deduct the interest on their college loans. Further, this bill includes a $1,500 HOPE scholarship credit for the first 2 years of college, and provides a credit for the second 2 years of college and for life-long learning, as well. For Connecticut, this package means that as many as 149,000 students will benefit--85,000 more Connecticut students than under the Republican proposal. 
This bill also provides targeted tax relief to middle class investors, small businesses and family farms. 
It reduces the capital gains tax rate in a way that encourages longer term investments and in a way that provides relief to a growing percentage of middle-class Americans reporting capital gains income on their tax return. And we provide measured relief without indexing these gains for inflation, a provision originally contained in the congressional leadership's proposal, which surely would have threatened to throw our budget out of balance. 
Further, if you've worked to own a home, and that home has increased in value, we exempt up to half a million dollars of that increase from capital gains taxes. This provision allows homeowners to reap the rewards of home ownership, and encourage more people to buy homes. This part of the tax package is particularly meaningful to homeowners in my State of Connecticut who were hurt disproportionately during the recession of 1991. 
And, if you're a farmer of a small business owner, we exempt the first $1.3 million of the value of your estate from taxation, so you can pass on the fruits of your labor to your children. 
Clearly, Mr. President, the bill before us today, makes a difference to small investors, small businesses, and hard-working Americans. It is reasonable and responsible, and recognizes the value of providing measured relief to American families, small businesses, and family farms. But fundamentally, this bill isn't about statistics. It's about meeting vital family needs and providing additional resources to meet the many challenges our working families face. This bill strengthens families and puts working families first. 
And yet, the underlying bill is not a perfect bill. In the midst of providing tax relief that is fair and equitable, I believe it is imperative that we not lose sight of our obligation to enact legislation that is fiscally responsible. We should be enacting legislation that will allow us to maintain the fiscal discipline we have worked so hard to achieve in recent years, dating back to the wise decisions we made in 1993. 
That is way I offered an amendment during the budget reconciliation negotiations which demanded we adhere to our budget agreement in which we agreed to a net tax cut of $85 billion through 2002, and not more than $250 billion through 2007. And that is why, today, I have serious concerns about Joint Committee on Taxation reports estimating that these tax cuts will cost $95 billion through 2002 and upwards of $275 billion by 2007. 
Nevertheless, this bill takes several steps to ensure that the cost of the tax cuts will not spiral in later years. Most significantly, it drops the proposal to index capital gains. In addition, it puts income limits on individual retirement accounts. 
Mr. President, we must be committed to preserving the integrity of the balanced budget agreement. The American people will not be served by a budget that reaches balance briefly in 2002 and then veers back out of balance afterward. 
Mr. President, on the whole, this agreement is more fair and more disciplined than any in recent history. The bill before us today does more for working families, more for small businesses, and more for family farms. We have stimulated jobs and growth, and encouraged investment, and most importantly, we have put America's families and their children first. I am proud of these accomplishments, Mr. President, and, let us not forget that we did it all while balancing the budget, benefiting Americans today and in the future.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, with today's passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Senate has taken a historic step toward ensuring the long-term solvency of the Medicare program. 
I am pleased that many of the provisions that I found to be so objectionable when this bill first came to the floor of the Senate one month ago, have since been removed. In stating my reasons for originally opposing the bill, I shared my deep concern over the proposal to raise the age at which individuals are eligible to receive Medicare from 65 to 67. The likelihood of these seniors finding affordable private insurance would have been slim--many would have been forced to forego coverage. It was a wise decision on the part of my colleagues serving as conferees on this bill that they did not decide to exacerbate the current problem of lack of health coverage for early retirees further with this measure. 
I am also pleased that a provision that would have required the poorest and sickest seniors to pay up to $700 a year in home health costs has also been dropped. Looking to the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries to shoulder this level of cost under the guise of addressing the long-term financial challenges of this program would have been indefensible. 
In addition to the removal of these onerous provisions, this legislation has been improved since the vote in the Senate by the commitment to continue Medicaid coverage for the 30,000 disabled children who will lose their Supplemental Security Income benefits as a result of eligibility changes in the welfare reform bill enacted last year. This provision, which was highlighted as a priority in the original budget agreement between President Clinton and Congress, was noticeably absent in both the House and Senate bills. Along with Senator Conrad, I offered an amendment to continue health insurance for these children and was disappointed to see it fail by only nine votes. However, I am grateful to the conferees that protection for these children of working poor families was achieved in the conference negotiations. 
This legislation will also significantly increase health coverage for children who currently lack insurance. We certainly have come a long way on this issue since the debates of earlier years. Even as recently as last year, the question was still whether or not to provide health insurance to our nation's children, rather than how we might accomplish this admirable goal. By adopting the Senate provision, which calls for $24 billion for this new initiative, we can now offer the hope to more than seven million children that cost will not be a barrier to securing health care. 
Of course, I am disappointed that the important and courageous attempt to ask those Americans who can afford to contribute a little more for their health care to do so was dropped. It is important to remember that only the wealthiest 8% of seniors would have seen a rise in their premiums. I maintain my conviction that the adoption of means testing of Medicare premiums was a step in the right direction toward the long-term solvency of the critically important safety net that Medicare provides to millions of senior citizens. 
I also continue to have significant concerns about the reductions in Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and managed care organizations. In order to ensure that our nation's seniors and lower-income citizens receive the affordable and high-quality care they need, health care providers must continue to be adequately funded. I am particularly concerned about the reduction in payments to teaching and disproportionate share hospitals. These hospitals serve a population that is sicker and poorer than most hospitals. Reduction in payments of this magnitude threaten the ability of these hospitals to continue to serve as a safety net for the most vulnerable in our society. 
In addition, I am concerned about the impact of the new HMO payment structure on low-income seniors who selected managed care plans because they truly need the additional benefits and low out-of-pocket costs that these plans can offer. These seniors cannot afford the high deductibles and copayments of Medicare fee-for-service, nor can they afford to purchase expensive Medigap coverage. While I am pleased that Congress has attempted to provide more health care choices for Medicare beneficiaries, I believe that without adequate funding, these choices will not be viable ones. 
Despite these concerns, this legislation goes a long way toward providing many of our nation's citizens with the care they need and expect from Medicare. I view it as an important step toward ensuring that Medicare is here to serve future generations of Americans. It is for this reason, Mr. President, that I am pleased to support the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for most Americans, mornings are a time of routines. People like to eat the same thing for breakfast, drink their coffee with just the right amount of cream and sugar, and duck out the door at the same time every day. Over the past 40 years, a central part of the morning routine for thousands of Connecticut residents has been the voice of Walt Dibble reading the news over the radio. During this time of the day where so many people are rushing around, Walt Dibble's calm presence served as a soothing influence that made each morning more pleasant. Sadly, the mornings in Connecticut will never be the same, as Mr. Walt Dibble died last week at the age of 65. 
A lifelong Connecticut resident, Walt Dibble was loved by all of the people in the state who listened to him. It didn't matter if they worked as a school teacher in Manchester, in the Inventory Control Division of Pratt & Whitney, or as a financial analyst in Hartford, all of Walt Dibble's listeners felt that he was a man whom they could relate to and whom they could trust. 
Walt Dibble was an institution in Connecticut radio. For the past 20 years, Mr. Dibble was the voice of WTIC news in Hartford, where he was the News Director and Managing Editor. Hartford was familiar with Walt Dibble even before he came to WTIC, since he had worked for 10 years at Hartford's WDRC radio station. Before coming to Hartford, Walt had been the radio voice of the news in New Haven and Bridgeport. 
Throughout his career he was always quick to pick up a microphone and hit the street to cover a breaking news story. And it was in these situations that Walt Dibble flourished. His colleagues always marveled at his ability to deliver extended live coverage of major news events without any script as a safety net. Whether it was covering the collapse of the Hartford Civic Center roof, Hurricane Gloria, or the debate over the state income tax in 1991, he always kept his cool and offered a professional news report that, in many cases, he made up as he went along. 
People may have wondered why Walt Dibble always seemed more sincere than other newscasters. The reason probably stems from the fact that Walt Dibble reported the news in his own words that came from his own mind and his own heart. 
Walt Dibble loved his profession, and he was a father figure for hundreds of Connecticut broadcasters. He treated the interns at the radio station with the same respect as lifelong colleagues, and he would always encourage them to embark on a career in radio. Mr. Dibble brought a similar approach to the classes he taught at the Connecticut School of Broadcasting and Southern Connecticut State University. He did not need to teach, but he did so because he wanted to pass the torch on to future broadcasters. 
In this day and age where most people get their news from television, and more and more radio stations are broadcasting nationally syndicated radio shows, Walt Dibble was a throwback to an era when the radio was the place where people went to get their local news. While it will be difficult for anyone to deliver the news with the style and grace of Walt Dibble, I only hope that somebody will carry on his tradition of excellence in broadcasting to ensure that Connecticut residents will still be able to receive local news, on local radio stations, from local broadcasters whom they know and trust. 
Walt Dibble lived a truly charmed life. He interviewed Presidents of the United States, he saw his son pitch in the World Series, and for more than 40 years he got to go to work to do a job that he loved. But in the end, it is the people of Connecticut who are charmed for having known this great man.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, spring has always been known as a season of rebirth, but, sadly, the Spring of 1997 saw the passing of one of the true culinary landmarks of Washington, D.C. as the Roma Restaurant closed its doors after 77 years. 
In the days since the Roma closed, the local newspapers have been filled with articles and letters to the editor paying tribute to the Washington institution. All of the writers had different memories of what made the Roma so special to them. For some it was the outdoor courtyard with the elaborate garden and grape arbor. For others it was the unique experience of dining amongst stuffed tigers, lions, and other wild game that Roma founder Frank Abbo had killed on safari. For some people it was simply the linguine with clam sauce. 
But for everyone who frequented the Roma, there are fond memories of the wonderful people who worked at this restaurant and made it such an enjoyable place to spend an afternoon or an evening. 
Patrons of the Roma have described members of the Abbo family, who owned and operated the Roma since it was founded in 1920, as having the biggest hearts in Washington. 
While most restaurants are closed for Thanksgiving and Christmas, the Roma was always open, as the Abbos cooked countless turkeys and prepared thousands of meals over the years for unfortunate people who could not afford to buy a warm holiday meal. 
The Roma was not just a business. It was more like a club where friends would meet regularly to get together and enjoy some good food and have a good time. 
Whenever I dined at the Roma, it felt like going to dinner at a friend's house. In a sense, it was, since the Roma's owner, Bobby Abbo has been a friend of mine for many years. But while I know that my friendship with Bobby will persevere and I will continue to see him, I will surely miss the many friendly faces that I may no longer see now that the Roma has closed. It would be impossible for me to remember all of the people whom I befriended at the Roma. However, I would specifically like to mention Maria Amaya, Hugo Terzi, and John Squitero and thank them for the kindness that they extended toward me over the years. 
In closing, I will miss the gardens, and I will miss the food. But, most important, I will miss the people that made the Roma such a special place. I wish all of them well, and I thank them for all of the wonderful memories they have provided me and so many others.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to six elementary schools from my home state of Connecticut whose achievements have earned them the honor of being named blue ribbon schools. The blue ribbon schools program was established in 1982 to honor the best elementary and secondary schools in the country. This program promotes excellence in education by providing national recognition to a diverse group of schools that display an uncommon ability to help their students to reach their potential. 
These blue ribbon schools, with their varied socioeconomic, geographic, and educational needs, prove that, with the right tools, all of our schools can be successful. They display the qualities of excellence that are necessary to prepare our young children for the challenges of the next century. Their formula for success is no secret. Each has strong leadership, a sense of mission, parental involvement, high quality teaching, and high standards and high expectations for each and every student. 
It is important that we make every child in this country believe in themselves, and blue ribbon schools are challenging our students to try harder and demand more from themselves. 
Of the 76,000 elementary schools across the country, only 263 are honored as blue ribbon schools, and I am proud of the fact that all six nominated schools from Connecticut were chosen to be honored. These six schools from Connecticut are Ellen B. Hubble Elementary School in Bristol, Highland Elementary School in Chesire, East Farms School in Farmington, the Center School in Litchfield, the Peck Place School in Litchfield, and West District School in Unionville. Each is different and unique, but they hold in common a commitment to helping all their students achieve high standards. I would like to briefly mention some of the unique accomplishments of each of these schools. 
Ellen P. Hubble School in Bristol is a center for innovation in education, where learning is fun. The school brings excitement to learning by developing building-wide themes. In the past, the school has been transformed into a farm, a forest, and a circus, and the children have responded by bringing uncommon enthusiasm to their schoolwork. The students of Ellen P. Hubble have also been very active in their community. Through the random acts of kindness and make a difference day program, students have worked on activities ranging from supporting a shelter for battered women to providing help for Bosnian refugees. 
Highland Elementary School is a reflection of the town of Cheshire's dedication to provide each young person with a nurturing, motivating, and enjoyable learning environment. Highland Elementary has formed a collaborative intervention team, composed of teachers and administrators, whose role is to identify and address the complex needs of each individual student. The teachers set high standards for their students, but the results have shown that great teaching inspires active learning. In addition, Highland is a member of the national network of Partnership 2000 schools, which fosters home-school partnerships. 
The East Farms School in Farmington is centered around the belief that all children are capable of becoming skillful, lifelong learners. The staff works within collaborative teams which develop an engaging inter-disciplinary curriculum. East Farms is the first school in Connecticut to establish their own publishing center. For 3 years, parents have assisted children and teachers in the publication of over 1,000 original books each year. This effort has not only brought students, parents, and teachers together in a learning exercise, it has also reinforced the value and importance of written work. 
At the Center School in Litchfield, lessons are planned around student inquiry, and teachers serve as facilitators rather than lecturers. In addition, students at the Center School are taught that the best way to solve a problem is by cooperating with others, and students are instilled with a strong sense of community. The school has been at the forefront of instructional reform, and the school's thematically arranged, interdisciplinary units of instruction have been hailed as exemplary by local, state, and national educators. The Center School was the first elementary school in Connecticut to be accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, and they recently received the Connecticut Award for Excellence. 
Teachers are at the center of efforts to provide children with a quality education at the Peck Place School in Orange. This school has invested in highly-qualified staff with 92 percent of the staff holding advanced degrees. Beyond an excellent traditional elementary schools curriculum, Peck Place also offers both French and Spanish to its students. Students and parents are enthusiastic partners in this effort. The Peck Place School proves a strong learning environment leads to improved performance by students. Connecticut mastery test scores have shown significant improvement in every grade, and grade four scores have jumped from 25 percent meeting or exceeding the State goals in 1993 to 74 percent in 1995. 
West District School in Unionville is a true neighborhood school where nearly half of the students walk to school every day, and many of them are the children of former students. West District is committed to the belief that all students are capable of learning at a high level if you nurture each student's special strengths. West District has formed a school development council, made up of teachers, staff, and parents, to work on ways to improve the school and to develop priorities for each school year. Last year the school chose to focus its efforts on addressing the needs of low-performing students, and the school worked diligently to bridge the gap between their most successful students and those who struggle with their classwork. The results have been successful as the vast majority of students are now performing at the high levels. West District boasts some of the highest Connecticut Mastery scores in the State, with 84 percent of sixth graders and 80 percent of fourth graders reaching the excellent level on the Connecticut mastery test in math. In addition, 80 percent of sixth graders achieved excellence in reading and 75 percent of fourth graders reached the excellence level in writing. 
Once again I would like to congratulate these six schools for being honored as blue ribbon schools. I believe that they all serve as models for other schools and communities seeking to provide young students with a nurturing environment that will enable each child to develop into a life-long learner.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my sincere congratulations to the students of Trumbull High School, who recently won an award at the `We the People * * * The Citizen and the Constitution' national finals in Washington, DC. 
The `We the People * * *' program includes a comprehensive curriculum on the history and principles of American constitutional democracy. It culminates in a competition testing student teams' knowledge of the Constitution, structured as a congressional hearing with students testifying as constitutional experts. This innovative approach has received critical acclaim from educators and scholars alike, and the curriculum stands as a model for future educational programs. Students involved in the `We the People * * *' program not only gain an understanding of constitutional history, but many of them also show a much stronger commitment to democratic principles and feel more involved in the political process. 
The students from Trumbull High School were recognized for their expertise on Unit 6 `Role of Citizen' of the `We the People * * *' curriculum. I'm very proud of their accomplishment, and would like to recognize them all by name: Katherine Baker, Scott Baker, Heather Beardsley, Annette Besso, Andrew Braverman, Meredith Bryk, Christopher Cheng, Jonathan Chin, Jessica Cohen, Vimala George, Kristy Gordon, Travis Halky, Stephen Henshaw, Ryan Leichsenring, Jennifer Liu, Devon Nykaza, Nicole Perreault, Diane Perry, Anne Rackliffe, Sophia Rountos, Rachel Simonds, and Alan Stern. 
In February 1963, President John F. Kennedy said that `the future promise of any nation can be directly measured by the present prospect of its youth.' Frighteningly low voter turnout has recently raised concerns about public frustration with our political system. And yet, when I had the opportunity to meet with these Trumbull high schoolers, I was struck by the students' optimism and thoughtfulness about our great constitutional democracy. Their strong sense of civic responsibility provides me with great hope for our future.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, any town in America can find somebody to run their local government. But few cities ever have a leader whose courage, hope, and humor serve to inspire others to expect more from themselves and their community. East Lyme was fortunate enough to know one of these leaders--David L. Cini. Mr. Cini served as East Lyme's first selectman since 1989, and, sadly, he died earlier this month at the age of 60. 
Eight years ago, I attended a political rally for David Cini that was held in a vacant lot behind a beauty salon in the small town of Niantic, CT, which is part of East Lyme. Also in attendance at this rally were Senator Joe Lieberman, Congressman Sam Gejdenson, and a host of other local dignitaries. Upon realizing that there were two U.S. Senators, a Congressman, and many other elected officials in attendance at this rally, I asked aloud, `Why are all of these important people gathered behind a beauty salon in Niantic?' David Cini quickly stood up and responded, `Because Niantic is the center of the universe, and I am going to be the first selectman.' 
For David Cini, Niantic and East Lyme was the center of the universe, and he really loved and took pride in this town and its people. One time, David cut short a week-long vacation in Florida to come back to East Lyme. He said that East Lyme was the best place to live and work so why leave? Mr. Cini loved the city of East Lyme and his primary concern as first selectman was improving the quality of life for these people. 
But while David Cini was completely committed to the people of East Lyme, he also recognized that the interests of one town are often connected to the interests of neighboring communities. He worked tirelessly to see that the towns in southeastern Connecticut worked together to preserve prosperity in the region. Mr. Cini was instrumental in the formation of the Council of Governments, which is comprised of the chief executive officers of 20 southeastern Connecticut towns, and he served as the council's first chairman. 
Throughout his tenure as East Lyme's top official, Mr. Cini had to overcome various health problems, but he always maintained a positive attitude, and you never saw him without a smile on his face. David was always too concerned with the welfare of others to dwell on his own personal interests. 
When you ask his friends what they will remember most about David Cini, they all mention his sense of humor. He was frequently seen joking with workers at Town Hall, and with his modest and unassuming manner, he could always make people laugh and put them at ease. 
His humor will be missed in Town Hall, and so will his leadership. David Cini was known and respected by his colleagues in politics, but, more important, he was admired by the people that he was elected to represent. 
He is survived by his wife Sally, seven siblings, five children, and four grandchildren. I extend my heartfelt condolences to them all.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I'm introducing two pieces of legislation intended to address the ongoing and utter failure of our Nation's child support efforts. 
Last week, the General Accounting Office released a long-awaited report on efforts to collect child support throughout the country. It paints a picture of a broken child support system: 
One where four out of five parents legally required to pay child support simply ignore court orders to do so; one where nearly three in four custodial parents--and their children--who receive no child support live in poverty (as of 1991); and one where a staggering $34 billion in child support payments remain uncollected. 
The current system of child support is not just a failure by the States to collect money. It's a nationwide failure to care for America's children. 
Imagine what parents could do for their kids with these billions in unpaid child support obligations. Currently, Congress and the President are engaged in a heated debate over how to provide health insurance to the 10 1/2 million kids who don't currently have it. We might not be having that debate if the child support system was working. 
Imagine how much better parents could prepare their children to get the right start in life. With each passing day, we are learning about how incredibly important the first years, months, even days of life are to a child's future well-being. Most importantly, they need what money can't buy: Love, affection, and attention--preferably by two parents rather than one. But they also need wholesome food, a clean and safe neighborhood, child care that nurtures rather than warehouses, and early learning that stretches young minds. Yet, nearly two in three--64 percent--of children under the age of 6 who live only with their mothers live in poverty. 
For two decades, the Federal Government has tried to 
help States crack down on deadbeat parents. For two decades they have, by and large, failed to get the job done. It's time now to try a different approach. 
In 1975, we established the child support enforcement program, which paid the majority of the administrative and operating costs incurred by States in enforcing child support rules. 
In 1980, we passed legislation to help States pay to computerize child support orders. 
In 1988, we passed a law requiring States to establish computer registries, and committed $2.6 billion to the effort. 
We set a deadline of 1995 for implementation and certification of those registries. But only a handful of States met that deadline. 
So in 1995, we extended the deadline 2 years, to October 1, 1997. Yet, at this moment, only 15 States have met the requirements of certification. And GAO predicts many will not meet them by October 1--a result of mismanagement, interagency squabbles, and a failure to accurately assess the cost and complexity of computerizing child support enforcement. 
Note that Connecticut at the moment is conditionally certified. That's a nice way of saying that it's close to meeting the requirements of certification, but not there yet. And while there has been some improvement in enforcement efforts, overall our State's performance is weak by any standard. Some $663 million in child support obligations remain unpaid and uncollected. The child support payment rate in our State--the percentage of payments that are on time and in full--is only 16 percent. That's below the national average. 
My legislation will do several things. 
First, and most importantly, it will federalize the child support system. It will make paying child support as much of an obligation as paying taxes. Instead of 50 or more entities struggling to create a coherent system of collection, we'll have one collector: the IRS. People may not like the IRS--but that's partly because it gets the job done. This bill creates a new child support enforcement division within the IRS, and allows the IRS to use its normal tax collection methods to collect child support. My legislation would also allow the use of Federal courts to enforce child support orders--which will immensely help track deadbeat parents across State lines. And it preserves the role of States in determining paternity and establishing child support orders in the first place. 
Second, this legislation tries a new approach to help States do a better job in child support enforcement. It's an approach that a number of States have tried with considerable success. It's called child support assurance. The bill I introduce today would provide demonstration grants to three, four, or five States. Those States would in turn guarantee child support payments each month to children and custodial parents. When this approach was tried in New York, a number of positive developments occurred. First, children got the support they needed. Second, welfare payments dropped. Third, New York could devote more resources to enforcing child support orders because it had to worry less about caring for parents and kids who weren't receiving child support payments. Overall, New York saved $10 for every $1 it invested in this program. 
Last week's GAO report demonstrates that it's time for our Nation to take a new approach in efforts to enforce child support obligations. This legislation can work. And now is the time to try it.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to support the restoration of funding for the National Endowment for Democracy in the Justice, State, Commerce appropriations bill. The amount is very modest--$30 million--and the same level of funding as the NED currently receives for this fiscal year. 
What is the NED? It is a grant-making organization that is governed by an independent, nonpartisan board of directors. NED monies are utilized to fund the activities of the four independent institutes--the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute, the Free Trade Union Institute, and Center for International Private Enterprise. 
In addition to funding the programs of these institutes, NED also provides grants directly to support democratic activist groups throughout the world. This includes grass roots organizations in Nigeria and Zaire, women's groups in moderate Islamic countries, civic groups who worked to make the recently held Mexican elections open and transparent, pro-democracy groups in Cuba, China and Burma. These are just a small handful of the activities funded by NED. 
The endowment also sponsors the Journal of Democracy, a well known and highly regarded scholarly publication on global democracy issues. The journal is part of the work of the International Forum for Democratic Studies--NED's research center. In addition to the publication of the journal, the Forum holds important conferences on issues of particular relevance to democratic societies, such as civil-military relations, economic reform, and the role of political parties. 
In other words, NED has become an important focal point for democracy-promotion activities around the globe. 
For those who say they don't know what NED or the grantee agencies have been doing with the funds they receive, I would urge them to take a long look at the annual report which NED issues every year. I have with me the latest report for 1996--that report goes into great detail where the monies are being spent. It is my view that if my colleagues would take a look at this publication they would be impressed with the extensive activities being undertaken with relatively small amounts of money. 
Mr. President, I strongly agree with President Clinton's assessment of the NED. Earlier this year he said of the NED, `through its everyday efforts, the Endowment provides renewed evidence of the universality of the democratic ideal and of the benefits to our Nation of our continued international engagement.' 
I urge my colleagues to support the restoration of funding for the Endowment.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment of my colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry]. This amendment will restore the COPS antidomestic violence grants created by the Violence Against Women Act--a program of vital importance that funds local police and community initiatives to combat domestic violence. 
Domestic violence is a serious scourge on our society. Once every 9 seconds, a woman is beaten by her husband or boyfriend, according to FBI crime statistics. Four women are killed each day at the hands of their domestic attackers, according to the National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women. And 16 people were killed by family violence in Connecticut between September 1995 and September 1996. That is totally unacceptable. 
Mr. President, for quite some time I have been extremely concerned that antidomestic violence programs currently funded through domestic violence COPS grants will no longer have a source of funding as the COPS grants for this purpose are eliminated. 
For too long before Congress enacted the 1994 crime law and Violence Against Women Act, domestic violence was considered a private matter--something to be dealt with inside the home, and outside of public view and public policy. The Violence Against Women Act represented a consensus that government and our communities should work together to prevent and stop domestic violence, and that it should be one of our highest priorities. 
In Connecticut, many communities were able to rise to that challenge when they received anti-domestic violence grants under the COPS program. More than ten Connecticut cites and towns have used these grants to establish law enforcement infrastructures to support a diverse range of anti-domestic violence programs, each specifically tailored to the needs of that local community. I recently had the opportunity to visit with two police chiefs who are using anti-domestic violence COPS grants to run domestic violence prevention and intervention programs in Bridgeport, CT, and Groton, CT. They have developed different programs that make use of a wide range of resources to fight domestic violence, utilizing police officers, involving victims' shelters and services, incorporating counseling for both victims and batterers, and aggressively pursuing prosecution of batterers. 
Programs like these send a message from our communities to victims and batterers alike. These programs say that domestic violence has no place in Connecticut or anywhere in our country. These programs say that if you are a batterer, we will stop you, we will catch you, and we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law. And I am told by police chiefs throughout Connecticut that that is why these programs, and the funds that make them possible, have truly improved their ability to combat domestic violence. Domestic violence is preventable, if we provide the funding for initiatives to stop it. 
Now, however, the elimination of antidomestic violence COPS grants threatens to force an untimely end to successful programs like those in Connecticut. Law enforcement officials would be hindered in their effort to prevent domestic violence and catch and punish perpetrators, and victims of domestic violence would continue to suffer. Let's not abandon police chiefs when they've just begun to win the battle against domestic violence. Let's not turn our backs on the victims who need our help. 
I wrote to the Commerce-State-Justice appropriators to ask them to maintain the funding for these important programs, and I am pleased today to cosponsor the amendment that would do just that. Hundreds of police chiefs and countless victims across the country are counting on us to do no less. 
I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his amendment, and I join him in urging my colleagues to adopt it.  
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier this month, the American flag was flown proudly throughout Connecticut and across this great land, as we celebrated our Independence Day. But the previous Friday, Old Glory was flying at half-staff in the town of Fairfield, CT, as the town mourned the passing of its longest serving first selectman--John J. Sullivan. 
John Sullivan came to Fairfield from Salem, MA, in the 1930's, and for more than 20 years, he was known throughout town as the owner and operator of Sullivan's Flower Shop on the Post Road. But in 1959, John Sullivan ran for public office for the first time in his life, and he was elected as the town's first selectman. His election was particularly significant, because it broke a 51-year Republican hold on Fairfield's top job. Although John Sullivan was a Democrat in a town dominated by Republicans, he was reelected 11 times, and his 24-year tenure stands as the longest in the town's history. 
I think that a large reason John Sullivan was so successful in reaching across party lines to be an effective leader is because his first concern was people, not politics. When describing his management style as the head of the board of selectmen, John Sullivan said, `I don't tell them how to vote * * * I tell them it's good for the community.' 
One of the most notable battles of his political career came in 1965, when John won reelection over a popular young challenger named Stewart B. McKinney. After this defeat, Mr. McKinney went on to serve seven terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, and John Sullivan often joked that if it weren't for him, McKinney would have never been a Congressman. The two of them went on to form a close political friendship. In fact, the only building in Fairfield which bears John Sullivan's name is the Sullivan-McKinney senior housing complex. 
During his tenure as first selectman, the population of Fairfield increased by 25 percent and the town's annual budget increased fourfold. But while John Sullivan oversaw the growth and development of Fairfield, the greatest sign of his legacy is the 1,200 acres of land that he had set aside as open space. Under John Sullivan's leadership, the town of Fairfield was able to secure Federal funds to purchase open space land and beach-front property. John Sullivan fought to maintain the small-town character of Fairfield, and there are now parks and woodland areas in Fairfield that serve as a peaceful refuge in this area of rapid urbanization. 
John Sullivan remained active in the community long after his political career ended. He worked on behalf of many charitable organizations, in particular St. Vincent's Medical Center Foundation in Bridgeport where he served as associate executive director. A devout Roman Catholic, John was a longtime member and trustee of St. Thomas Aquinas Church. He went to Mass every day, and in 1984, John was appointed a Knight of St. Gregory by Pope John Paul II. 
I think that the one quote that best illustrates what kind of person John Sullivan was came in 1983 when he retired from public office. John said, `I am the richest man in the world. I ask for nothing. I want to give as much as I can.' 
I attended John Sullivan's funeral, and having known him personally, I was not surprised to see how many people came out to pay tribute to this wonderful man. John Sullivan was a true patriot, and he will be dearly missed by all who knew him. 
John was the husband of the late Mary B. Cahill Sullivan. He is survived by his brother Edwin Sullivan, his daughter Mary Donahue, and his seven grandsons, John, James, Brian, Robert, Paul, William, and Patrick. I offer my most heartfelt condolences to all of them.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to join my colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, as we introduce the Creating Improved Delivery of Child Care: Affordable, Reliable, and Educational (CIDCARE) Act of 1997. 
This legislation will go a long way toward giving parents peace of mind. Child care shouldn't be like going to Las Vegas--where you roll the dice and hope for the best. Parents should be confident that when they are not able to be with their children, their children will still be well cared for. We shouldn't be gambling with our children's health and safety. 
Up to this point Mr. President, we in the federal government have largely deferred the issue of quality of child care to the states. The sole significant contribution of the federal government to improving the quality of this nation's child care is the modest 4% setaside for quality improvement that we struggled to create within the child care development block grant. This lack of federal support for quality has not served children well. 
A few years ago my good friend, Professor Ed Zigler of Yale University, did a survey of state child care regulations. He found, in short, that states are failing the `quality test'--no state had child care regulations in place that could be characterized as good quality standards. Only a third of states had minimally acceptable regulations. Two-thirds of states had regulations that didn't even address the basics--caregiver training, safe environments, appropriate provider-child ratios. 
Keep in mind, we're not even talking about how well or whether states actually enforced those standards. This study was simply asking a question about the first step in quality--whether states had basic child care quality standards on the books that providers could be held to. This legislation addresses, for the first time on a federal level, the issues of quality child care. We have safety standards for the food we eat and the cars we drive. Is it too much to have some basic standards for child care providers--individuals who literally hold a child's life in their hands? I think not, Mr. President. And even beyond basic health and safety standards, we must consider how we can assist caregivers in supporting children's growth and development. 
Mr. President, this legislation will help working families afford child care. Specifically, this bill more equitably distributes the child care tax credit by making the credit refundable for lower income families, increasing the credit for families under $55,000, and phasing down the credit to a minimum of 10% for higher income taxpayers. Further, it increases the amount that employees can contribute to Dependent Care Assistance Plans (DCAP).  
The CIDCARE bill further provides incentives for parents to choose high quality child care by providing a higher tax credit and larger DCAP allowances for families that use accredited or credentialed services, reflecting the higher expenses associated with higher quality care. 
Additionally, this legislation encourages child care centers and providers to offer high quality child care. It gives child care providers a higher deduction for the educational expenses related to achieving or maintaining accreditation. It further provides $50 million to create and operate a technology-based training infrastructure, that builds upon existing distance learning, Internet, and satellite resources, to enable child care providers nationwide to receive training, education, and support. It also provides loan forgiveness for Perkins and Stafford educational loans for child care workers who obtain a degree in early childhood education or receive professional child care credentials. This bill would also require federal child care centers to meet all state and local licensing and other regulatory requirements related to the provision of child care. 
This legislation will also give businesses incentives to support quality child care for their employees and the community at large. It will allow businesses a charitable deduction for donating educational equipment to non-profit child care providers, support entities, and public schools and provides a tax credit for employers who develop child care centers for their employees. 
Finally, Mr. President, the CIDCARE bill will provide grants to states to support quality child care. It establishes a $260 million competitive grant program to assist states in improving the quality of child care through mechanisms such as: salary increases for credentialed child care providers: developing standards for the accreditation and credentialing of child care providers; scholarship programs to help child care providers meet the costs of education and training; expanding training and technical assistance activities; consumer education efforts, and increased rates of reimbursement for the care of children with special needs. 
Mr. President, quality child care can no longer be considered a luxury reserved for the very few. This should not be a partisan issue. All of us want the best for our children. And when they can't be with their parents, we want them to be in high quality care. This legislation will move us in that direction. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Jeffords and myself in support of the CIDCARE bill.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, during the consideration of the foreign operations appropriations bill yesterday, I offered an amendment along with Senator McCain on the drug certification issue. During the course of that debate, some references were made to Gen. Barry McCaffrey that I thought were unfortunate and incorrect. 
John McCain, our colleague from Arizona, rightly stood up and pointed out that Barry McCaffrey, whatever one's views may have been on the certification issue, enjoys, I think, without any question, the tremendous confidence of the Members of this body. We may disagree on various policy issues. I wanted to associate myself with Senator McCain's remarks and express my gratitude to General McCaffrey for taking on this job, one of the most difficult jobs in Government, that is, to be the drug czar. 
Mr. President, I wanted to express my confidence, and I am confident the confidence of my colleagues, in Barry McCaffrey. This is a very difficult job he has taken on. It is tremendously complex. It is obviously a source of great, great disturbance in this country to watch the ever-increasing proliferation of illegal drugs, and obviously there is a domestic feature to this and there is an international feature to it. His job is not an easy one and he has to deal with people all over the globe. I think he does so with a great deal of integrity, seriousness, and forthrightness. He has been tremendously responsive to those of us up here on Capitol Hill who care about this issue. 
I thank Senator McCain for his remarks yesterday and associate myself, as I said, with those remarks, and once again express my high degree of confidence in the General and my appreciation as well for the work he has done. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the funding for the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as allocated in the Treasury, General Government, Civil Service Appropriations Bill. 
All of us know that Congress' appropriators are tasked with guiding one of the most difficult of our duties--deciding how to spend the taxpayers' money. While I appreciate the magnitude and difficulty of this task as approached by the Subcommittee on Treasury, General Government, and Civil Service Appropriations, I am disappointed that the committee did not provide the FEC with full funding at its request of $34.2 million, as supported by the President. 
Mr. President, the citizens' cries for campaign finance reform are growing louder and louder. Why? Because campaign spending is out of control. As money floods endlessly into our electoral system, however, I fear the voice of the average American will be drowned out and democracy will be the victim. 
Much must be done to truly and effectively clean up our political campaigns. But one thing we can do to start right now is provide the FEC--the agency charged by Congress with overseeing our campaign finance system--with the finances it needs to promptly and effectively enforce the laws that govern our campaigns. 
Consider that, in just eight years, we have seen a fourfold increase in the amount of money raised and spent by both parties, from $220 million raised by both parties in 1988 to $881 million raised in 1996. 
In just four years, we have seen a 73 percent increase in political costs. A 73 percent increase in political costs since 1992--while wages rose 13 percent and education costs rose 17 percent during that same period. 
Congressional spending in 1996 general elections was $626.4 million, 6.3 percent higher than the record 1994 levels. 
And an unprecedented $2.5 billion in financial activity was reported to the commission in 1996. 
And it was the FEC that had to oversee all this spending, to be sure it complied with the law. 
This increase in campaign spending has therefore generated a sharp increase FEC's workload. Between 1994 and November of 1996, the FEC's caseload rose 36 percent, and because complaints related to the 1996 election are still being filed, the FEC expects the caseload to ultimately rise by 52 percent. Yet, providing adequate funding for the FEC has been a constant battle. Recent rescissions and funding rollbacks have prevented the FEC from keeping up with its ever-increasing workload and meeting inflation in rent and salary costs. 
This combination of a decreasing budget and an increasing workload have hamstrung the FEC's ability to fulfill its watchdog role in a timely and effective manner. At the same time the FEC's caseload has risen, staff cuts required by the post-FY '95 budget reductions have led to a 25 percent drop in the FEC's ability to handle those cases. 
Perhaps that is one reason why the FEC has become known as a toothless tiger. I believe it is time to give this tiger the teeth it needs to carry out its duties. 
Mr. President, we are in the midst of multiple government investigations into campaign financing--investigations I wholeheartedly support. But as Congress has allocated millions of dollars for burgeoning Congressional campaign finance investigations, the least we can do is provide adequate funding for the independent and bipartisan FEC to do its job. 
Many of my colleagues have said that campaign finance reform is not the issue for 1997. The illegalities of 1996, they say, is the issue. Yet, at the same time, they refuse to fund the very agency that should be first to uncover and punish any illegalities. 
In October 1996, following news reports of alleged irregularities in fundraising by both political parties, I initiated a request that the FEC conduct an investigation of the Democratic National Committee, and pledged to make available all relevant records and personnel. At a Rules Committee hearing earlier this year, I was shocked to learn that as of February 1997, due to the tremendous backlog of cases and funding shortfalls at the FEC, that investigation had not even begun. While I am informed today that the investigation has now begun, I believe the delay in commencing the audit is illustrative of the magnitude of the FEC's budget problems.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offered the second-degree amendment and it doesn't substantially change the original amendment, but it is so that we can have an up-or-down vote on the substance of the amendment I offered on behalf of myself, my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, Senator Daschle, Senator Lugar, Senator Domenici, Senator Cochran, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Hutchison, Senator Hagel, Senator Warner, and Senator Inouye. 
Mr. President, we believe that the approach contained in this amendment will lead to a far more cooperative and effective effort to meet the international threat posed by the international drug trafficking that is occurring in our country and elsewhere around the globe. 
The pending amendment calls upon the President of the United States to establish a high-level interdisciplinary task force, under the direction of General Barry McCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, to develop a comprehensive strategy for dealing with the supply and demand side of the drug problem. 
This amendment also urges the President of the United States to encourage other drug-producing, and transit countries to undertake similar efforts. Within a year's time, it calls for an international summit to be held, at which time the efforts of all of the parties would be merged into a multilateral battle plan to engage the illegal drug trade on every front. 
In order to create the kind of international cooperation and mutual respect that must be present if this effort is to produce the results all of us desire, our amendment would also temporarily suspend, for 2 years, the annual drug certification procedure while efforts are ongoing to develop and implement a new strategy. It does not repeal the certification process, but suspends it for 2 years in order to try this new dynamic. Barry McCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, supports this amendment, as does the administration. 
As you know, the issue of how best to construct and implement an effective counternarcotics policy has been the subject of much debate in this Chamber and, I add, much disagreement over the years. Our intention in offering this amendment today is to try and see if there isn't some way to end what has become a stale annual event, an event that has not brought us one step closer to mounting a credible effort to eliminate or even contain the international drug Mafia. 
We all can agree that drugs are a huge problem and a growing problem. Illegal drugs aren't some theoretical abstraction that only concerns Members of Congress. Most American families know --many firsthand, unfortunately--the dangers inherent in the drug trade. They worry about their children, their schools, their streets, and their communities. They know only too well the impact that unfettered drug gangs can have on them, their families, and the towns in which they live. 
We can all agree here, Mr. President, that there is an important international component to the drug menace. Drug kingpins have no respect for international borders. They ply their trade clandestinely wherever the opportunities may arise. The international drug trade poses a direct threat, I argue, to the United States as a government here at home, and to international efforts to promote democracy, economic stability, human rights, and the rule of law throughout the globe; but most especially, I think, here in our own hemisphere. 
Mr. President, I have concerns about the international implications of the drug trade. Of even greater concern to me personally are the effects it is having here in the United States. Today, approximately 12.8 million Americans use illegal drugs, including 1.5 million cocaine users, 600,000 heroin addicts, and 9.8 million people who have used marijuana. 
This menace isn't just confined to our inner cities or the poor. Illegal drug use occurs among members of every ethnic and socioeconomic group in this country. The human and economic costs are enormous and staggering. Drug-related illness, death, and crime cost our Government and the taxpayers of this Nation approximately $67 billion in 1996, including costs for lost productivity, premature death, and incarceration. 
The drug trade is an enormously lucrative business. Drug trafficking generates estimated revenues of $400 billion annually. Although often left unstated, it is United States' demands for these illegal drugs which has been a driving force making drug trafficking the incredibly lucrative enterprise it has become. The principal focus of the U.S. international counternarcotics efforts has been to endeavor to go to the source, to penetrate the narcotrafficking organizations that control the production and distribution of drugs, and to dismantle them. An important component of that international effort since 1986 has also included as its centerpiece the so called `annual certification process.' 
Mr. President, I commend those who authored the certification process. Their intent, as is the intent of us who offer this amendment, is the same; that is, to try and figure out a way to slow down this traffic that pours into our country. Mr. President, I respectfully suggest that, after 10 years, the certification process has not helped. Therefore, we are trying, through this amendment, a new process by which we might, hopefully, change the dynamic and reverse the present trends that continue upward. The United States has spent more than $25 billion since 1981 for foreign interdictions and source country counternarcotics projects, and has been issuing an annual certification report card since 1986. 
Yet, despite these efforts, seizures at the borders, from the high seas, and other countries, foreign drugs are cheaper and more readily available in the United States today than they were two decades ago. Drugs have continued to flood our neighborhoods and wreak havoc on our families and our communities. I believe, as do my cosponsors of this amendment, that it is time to be honest and to admit that our international drug strategy isn't working, and that means the entire certification process. 
Let's look at what some leading editorial pages have recently said about certification; what the Nation's editorial pages say about drug `certification.' 
The Washington Post: 
Congress put the United States into the business of grading other nations on their performance in the war against drugs, and punishing those found to fall short, back in 1986. `Certification' then seemed an idea worth testing. It has now been tested. It's a flop. 
The Miami Herald, I quote:  
Not surprisingly, both certified allies and decertified pariah states have taken umbrage at this unilateral finger-pointing by the world's largest consumer of illegal narcotics * * * With certification on hold, the administration should have time to craft a better policy. 
San Francisco Chronicle: 
Often obscured in the complexities of international relations is the utter hypocrisy of the certification process, in which the United States--the world's leading consumer of illegal drugs--passes judgment on countries that do not live up to our lofty standards of narcotics control * * * If the United States, with all its power and riches, cannot control or even diminish the demand for drugs within its own borders, it is absurd to demand that much poorer nations save us from ourselves * * * Congress should rethink the world certification process and deal with international problems on a country-by-country basis as the need arises * * *

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me just emphasize, if I can, that I don't necessarily agree with all of the conclusions in these editorials. Some have suggested repeal. There is a part of me that finds that appealing. But I am not sure what we are going to offer over the next 2 years is necessarily going to work either. I don't have any absolute certainty of guarantees that what we offer as an alternative will work. But I think all of us can agree that suspension for a couple of years, as General McCaffrey has suggested, to try the cover the dynamic here is worth the effort and worth a try. 
This doesn't mean you are less strong or less outraged or less concerned about what is happening to narcotics trafficking. Quite the contrary. I think those who support this recognize that we are trying to get a better handle on this to see if we can't have better answers because the current process is not working. We need a better idea. Hopefully people of good intention, good will, and putting their shoulders to the wheel in this country and elsewhere can come up with some better ideas over the next 2 years and really begin to make some headway in this effort. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in response to my colleague's questions, I would say, First, the price of drugs is lower today, the lowest they have been in two decades. We just came from a hearing chaired by our colleague from Georgia, which my colleague from Massachusetts, who is on the floor, attended. We heard at that hearing that the problem is getting worse--not better. In the countries that we have decertified, I say to my colleague from Arizona, over the last couple of years the problem gets worse--not better. We are getting less cooperation in many places. There is a sense of antagonism about how we approach this issue. 
So while I applaud the intentions of those who authored this process--and I understand the rationale for it back in 1986--from time to time I think we have to step back and ask ourselves blunt questions as to what we have tried to do, no matter how well intended. Is it working? If it is not, and if the problem is getting worse, then I would say to my colleague from Arizona, in response to his question, that maybe we ought to think anew. That is what this amendment does, without repealing the certification process but merely suspending it for a couple of years to see if we can't come up with a better idea.

Mr. DODD. In response to my colleague's questions, I would agree with him. That is one of the problems with this. It is so uneven in its application, and as such one might argue that the effectiveness of it is thereby debilitating--that, if we are going to certify some, and waive others where the problem arguably is the same, although one might make a case that there are various efforts in certain countries, I think you end up with the kind of situation we are in today where the desire for cooperation and the efforts of cooperation have been severely curtailed as a result of it. 
So even if you are trying to send a message here, it gets lost in the process. I note in the case of Colombia--which is certainly a major source country problem without any question whatsoever--but I pointed out, as I know my colleague from Arizona has from time to time, that this has paralyzed the country of Colombia. Many may recall that a number of years ago the entire supreme court of that country was assassinated. One attorney general after the other, the chief prosecutor, all of these people have been assassinated. Presidential candidates get assassinated. One might argue that they are paying an awful price in that nation. 
If we decertify, we lose any kind of cooperation in terms of what we ought to be trying to seek there. In the case of Mexico, as my colleague has pointed out--he certainly knows Mexico as well as any Member of this body--there are serious problems there and well documented. Yet, both of us are aware of the fact that there are serious economic implications. So we send a signal of waiving and apply a different standard, and that message is not just heard in both Colombia and Mexico, it resonates throughout this hemisphere. Again, my colleague from Arizona spends a great deal of time on hemispheric issues. He has heard what I have heard over and over again; this is not helping at all. There are other countries involved. We have laundering, transit countries, other countries producing, and, frankly, this effort of cooperation is just collapsing in our midst. 
So this has not worked.

Mr. DODD. I say, in my response to the questions, the Senator is absolutely correct. He stated it very well. And that certainly was the evidence offered by General McCaffrey and others whose business it is on a daily basis to monitor these events--and he suggested to us that, if cooperation is what we are seeking, the vehicle we have been using is not having the desired effect despite again the good intentions of those who sought this process. 
I say to my colleague from Arizona, in response to his question, that the genesis of the certification process dates back to a time when I think there was bipartisan frustration over whether or not there was enough attention being paid at the executive branch level in terms of the drug-related issue. So a certification process was put in place. 
I think most would argue today that however true those feelings may have been over a decade ago that over the last number of years there has been a heightened degree of involvement on the part of the executive branch--witness, of course, General McCaffrey, whom we all respect--doing the best they can. It is their conclusion, as well as my colleague from Arizona, as he pointed out, that this is counterproductive. 
I might point out, that the elections that recently took place in Mexico were historic. I think my colleague and I would agree on this. It looks as close to a democratic and corruption-free election as probably has been held in Mexico. You have new members of the national legislature, and hopefully a new beginning in many ways here. It seems to me that our efforts here might do a lot to get that kind of cooperation out of new members of the Mexican Government--the legislative branch, along with President Zedillo, who, I think all of us would agree, has certainly been most cooperative in this effort. 
So I agree with my colleague.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it would. I urge my colleague at the appropriate time to ask unanimous consent that these letters be a part of the Record. I thank General McCaffrey for his letter and Sandy Berger for his letter. 
Again, they state it very well. My colleague from Arizona has stated it well. We offer this suspension--and, again, I want to emphasize `suspension,' Mr. President--for 2 years of the present law, not a repeal. There are some who would like to repeal it, and I might be counted among those, but I respect the fact that a suspension is the best way to go at this point. 
But our colleague from Arizona states it well. The present system is broken. It is not working. We need some new, fresh efforts here. And with the commitment of General McCaffrey here saying to us, look, my office is prepared to lead an interagency task force to develop a new strategy. His letter to us today, I think it says it all. What better way to get started, if you will, than to have a clean slate for a couple of years to allow General McCaffrey and his team to go forward and try to do that without repealing the law of certification but merely suspending it. 
You are going to get a lot more cooperation, it seems to me, with a suspension for 2 years and trying to bring these countries in than there will be if we gather as we do annually and go through this process, as our colleague from Arizona pointed out here, again on the certification. We are out here debating 11th-hour negotiations on waivers, all efforts to try to avoid a catastrophe, and once again find ourselves in a mess with certification practices and no advance strategy to deal with this issue. I am grateful to the Senator from Arizona, the administration and General McCaffrey for this effort. 
I think this is a good, bipartisan effort, Mr. President, to come up with a new dynamic, and I thank again my colleague for his support and leadership on this effort.  
Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator. 
Madam President, I have been listening for the last hour and a half, roughly, to all the argument against this amendment, except for my 2 colleagues from Texas, to whom I am grateful for making their case. I want to make the case on behalf of Senator McCain and myself, and Senators Domenici, Cochran, Daschle, Kerrey, Warner, Inouye, Hutchison, and others who have supported this amendment, the cosponsors of the amendment. We have had 11 years. We didn't come up with this overnight. We have had 11 years. We have now 12.8 million people using illegal drugs in this country; 1.5 million cocaine addicts; 600,000 heroin addicts. What do we want to do, wait another year, another 2 years? Do you want that number to be 13 million drug addicts in the country? How about a million heroin addicts? When do we stop? 
The present system isn't working. We have decertified about 7 countries over the last several years. If anything, we have had less cooperation--Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Syria, Colombia--and what do we get back from it? If this is working so well, are these countries cooperating today? No, we are not getting cooperation. All we are getting is a deluge of drugs pouring into the country. 
So I don't disagree that maybe the certification may be the only answer. But how about for 24 months we try something else, after 11 years, and if we get nothing but an increase in supply, lower costs, and the problem becomes worse and worse and worse, why don't we try something else? That is all Senator McCain and I are suggesting--for 24 months, suspend the certification process. Listen to General McCaffrey; he supports what we are trying to do here. He doesn't have a silver bullet either. But maybe, just maybe, we might come up with a better idea and do so in a sense of cooperation with nations we are going to have to have cooperation from if we are going to succeed. 
So, Madam President, with all due respect, when I hear that this is coming sort of unannounced--and I listened today, as I was at those hearings as well, to those witnesses and I heard them as well. The situation is worse today than 6 months ago, a year ago, or two years ago, and it is getting worse. So how about trying something else, which is something we don't do terribly frequently around here; we stick with provisions and say you can't change them. 
We represent 5 percent of the world's population and we consume over 50 percent of the illegal drugs in the world. Before we start lecturing everybody else, we ought to look in our own backyard and decide what we can do here at home as well. 
For those reasons, I urge our colleagues to give us a chance, with this modest proposal, to try something different. As General McCaffrey said in his letter, and Sandy Berger at the National Security Council, this deserves an opportunity to be tried. I urge my colleagues to do that.

Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am going to yield 30 seconds to my colleague from Arizona. 
This amendment, offered by myself, Senator McCain and many others, suspends for 24 months the voting on the certification process. All the reports are collected, but this is an opportunity, as General McCaffrey says in his letter endorsing this amendment, this gives us time to try something different. After 11 years, the problem has gotten worse. We need to try a different dynamic. This will give us 24 months to try it. We urge the adoption of the amendment. 
I yield to my colleague from Arizona.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to rise to comment on the amendment that may be offered by the distinguished Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin]. His amendment would seek to close, once and for all, the U.S. Army School of the Americas, presently located at Fort Benning, GA. 
I am totally sympathetic with the intent of the Senator's amendment. Clearly the entire history of the School of the America's, and particularly the period from 1982-1991, is shameful. It has left a legacy that is an ugly blemish on our country's credibility as an advocate of full respect for human rights and the rule of law in a region where human rights violations have occurred with impunity. 
Like Senator Durbin, I believe that the United States has a special obligation to promote democracy throughout the world, and most especially in our own hemisphere. 
Given the recent history of military rule in many countries in the region, it is particularly important that the United States strongly support the concept of civilian control over national military institutions. 
It also means highlighting the importance of respecting the human rights of all the peoples of the hemisphere. And, in particular, the obligation of military and security forces throughout the region that they do so. Finally it means stressing the principle that national military and security forces are accountable for acts that fall short of acceptable international human rights standards and practices. 
I would say to my colleague from Illinois, that if closing down the School of the Americas would remedy all of the evils that have been perpetrated by a number of individuals trained there over the years, I would strongly support his effort. 
Unfortunately, even if we were to shut the doors at the School of the Americas tomorrow, that would not be the case. Moreover, the School of the Americas is not the only location where Latin American military personnel receive United States-supported training. 
Equally important is acknowledgment that countries throughout the region have legitimate national security interests that necessitate the existence of national armed forces in these countries. 
Shutting the School of the Americas doesn't obviate the need that regional militaries get the right kind of training for their personnel. 
I have had the opportunity to review excepts from the manuals that were utilized in the training of Latin American personnel throughout the 1980's and into the early 1990's. Clearly these manuals espoused practices that can only be described as coercion, torture, and assassination. 
I know that the Defense Department has looked into the background of these manuals, and has found, not once but twice, that mistakes were made--but that no one is really responsible. 
Frankly, it defies credibility to accept one of the central conclusions of the 1997 Defense Department 
inspector general's review of this. 
Among other things, the IG concluded that while, 
. . . five of the seven manuals contained language and statements in violation of legal, regulatory, or policy prohibitions, such as motivation by fear, payment of bounties for enemy dead, false imprisonment, and the use of truth serum . . . . Army personnel involved in the preparation and presentation of the intelligence courses did not recognize that the training materials contravened DOD policy and [there was] no evidence that a deliberate and orchestrated attempt was made to violate DOD or U.S. Army policies. 
So much for any sensitivity with respect to human rights that United States troops are supposed to be indoctrinated in. 
School of the Americas instructors tutored Latin American military personnel in how to use threats of force with prisoners, neutralize opponents, hold prisoners in clandestine jails, and infiltrate and spy on civilian organizations and opposition political parties for at least 10 years. Despite the fact that such training explicitly violates U.S. policy. 
The IG does not deny that such training was a clear violation of U.S. policy, but attributes it to the equivalent of staff error. The IG found that-- 
. . . from 1982 to 1991, many mistakes were made and repeated (with respect to use of these manuals) by numerous and continually changing personnel in several organizations from Panama to Georgia to Washington, DC. Lack of attention to the Department of Defense and U.S. Army policies and procedures by those personnel and organizations perpetrated the assumption that the materials in the Spanish language intelligence manuals were proper and doctrinally correct. 
I don't know anything about the background of the current IG who came to this conclusion. 
But I think it is safe to say that if he/she had bothered to review the extensive Congress debate that occurred during much of this same time period over United States policy with respect to Latin America--he would have found the often stated concern about the substantial human rights abuses that were being perpetrated by members of these military forces, particularly those in Central America. 
Those of us who were here remember only too well that the Department of Defense was being queried on a weekly basis about all aspects of U.S. policy during that time period--including the training and other support the United States was providing to these military and security forces. 
Many of us in this body who participated in those rancorous debates could take up hours here today reliving that period. 
But that isn't a good use of the Senate's time, nor does it do anything to address the underlying concerns with respect to the nature and content of United States-sponsored military training programs for the Latin American and Caribbean region. 
The amendment that I will offer at the appropriate time would go to the heart of this. It would not close the School of the Americas. Rather, it would mandate that at least 36 percent of IMET-supported course curriculum 
be for, so-called expanded IMET courses--namely those devoted to training Latin American Armed Forces in skills that will better prepare them to serve their democratic countries as we enter the 21st century. It would also require that these courses be available to nonmilitary government officials with responsibilities for defense policies in their countries as well. 
As many of my colleagues are aware, in 1989 Senator Leahy first introduced the concept of this new, so-called expanded IMET. Simply put, to qualify as an expanded IMET course its purpose must be to educate Latin American military and civilian personnel in the proper management of their defense resources, in improving their systems of military justice in accordance with internationally recognized principles of human rights or in fostering greater respect for and understanding of the principle of civilian control of the military. 
Despite the fact that Senator Leahy first proposed the creation of expanded IMET more than 8 years ago, even today Latin American military students are afforded very few opportunities to avail themselves of such courses. 
Only 4 of the more than 50 courses offered in the 1997 School of the America's curriculum quality as expanded IMET courses. 
That is totally unacceptable and is additional evidence that the U.S. Army just doesn't get it when it comes to the importance that must be accorded to promoting respect for human rights throughout the hemisphere. 
For that reason this amendment would specifically mandate that 30 percent of Latin American IMET funds be spent in support of preparing Latin American military and appropriate civilian and legislative defense personnel for their appropriate roles in democratic societies as we begin the next millennium. 
I would hope that all of my colleagues would support this amendment.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, last week I had worked out an amendment with the managers of the national defense authorization bill that provided for the Secretary of Defense to study and report on the status of environmental problems in Bermuda associated with the United States military presence on that island for more than 50 years. Senator Inhofe, the subcommittee chairman was particularly helpful in working with me. 
Inadvertently that amendment was not included in the managers en bloc amendment package on Friday afternoon. However, I am very grateful to the chairman and ranking member of the Arms Services Committee that, by unanimous consent, they have agreed to include this amendment in the authorization bill. 
Mr. President, for more than 50 years, United States military personnel were deployed to bases on the Island of Bermuda. In fact, United States bases occupied approximately one-tenth of Bermuda's land area. The 1941 Leased Bases Agreement formalized the conditions under which the United States military remained in Bermuda until 1995. The United States was not charged a penny in rent for its use of these properties during all of that period. 
I know that the distinguished ranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Inouye, is fully aware of the questions that have been raised related to the United States military presence in Bermuda. I would ask him whether he believes that this is something that the Secretary of Defense should look into?

Mr. DODD. Mr President, I know that my distinguished colleague from Hawaii knows well that Bermuda is actually a tiny group of islands, 21 square miles in land area. Its environmental situation is unique in many respects--land is obviously scarce, fresh water resources are very limited, and storage capacity for hazardous waste disposal doesn't exist. It is also one of the most northerly coral reef areas, making the marine environment surrounding the island extremely fragile as well. 
Mr. President, I call to the attention of my distinguished colleague from Hawaii that it would appear that the formerly United States occupied properties that have now reverted back to Bermudian authorities could pose a number of problems for that Government--problems that they are now seeking our help in ameliorating. These problems include soil and ground water pollution and asbestos hazards contained in now deserted U.S. military installations on the bases. 
For example, most of the buildings on the bases will require demolition, if this property is to be useable again. That means that the hazardous asbestos must also be removed and appropriately stored. In addition, industrial wastes and raw sewage that were disposed of in Bassett's Cave over time will pose a threat to parts of the island's water system unless they are removed. Underground and above-ground petroleum storage tanks--many in poor condition--are leaking into surrounding soils and ground water. Left behind landfills are also causing environmental problems.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleagues, Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye, for their work on this appropriations bill and the bipartisan spirit in which it was crafted. 
I wish to speak for a moment on the amendment I offered on Persian Gulf war illnesses that was accepted by the chairman and ranking member. 
The amendment will provide $4.5 million for the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration to determine what treatments are working for those who are afflicted with Persian Gulf war illnesses. 
The reasonableness and necessity for action along these lines seem so obvious that many of my colleagues probably find it difficult to believe that such action has not already been taken. To allay their doubts, let me quote directly from a GAO report released just last month: `There is an absence of efforts to measure Gulf War veterans clinical progress. This leaves the government unable to promptly determine the quality and effectiveness of treatments currently being provided to Gulf War veterans.' 
That's not an angry Senator making unsupported allegations. That's the objective, nonpartisan view of the General Accounting Office. 
Mr. President, at this point, it seems to me that we've left our ailing troops on the battlefield. Here we are, 6 years after the end of the Persian Gulf war and it takes an act of Congress to begin an effective examination of which treatments are most effective in caring for our veterans with Persian Gulf war illnesses. 
While I am heartened by the fact that we're offering examinations to those who served in the Persian Gulf War, I feel it's important to take the next step to determine what happens after that initial examination. Often I hear stories of families being forced to look outside the government agencies to get the care and compensation their Persian Gulf war veterans deserve. 
So those are the reasons that I offered the amendments to the Defense authorization bill and the Defense appropriations bill. Mr. President, nearly 700,000 men and women served in our Armed Forces in the Persian Gulf war. Five thousand of them were constituents of mine. Depending on what reports you read, as many as 10 percent of those who served are today ailing from some form or another of these Persian Gulf war illnesses. That's far too many to be left out on the battlefield. One ailing veteran forgotten by this country is too many. I expect to see some progress now on finding and employing effective treatments for those with Persian Gulf war illnesses. 
Let me again express my gratitude to the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii for approving of this funding and accepting the amendment. I'm sure they feel equally compelled by the issues raised here.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to offer some brief comments, if I may, regarding a good friend to many of us here who will be returning to his country in the next few days. I speak of Dermot A. Gallagher, Mr. President, the current Ambassador of Ireland to the United States. 
Mr. President, Dermot Gallagher can leave the United States with pride in the work that he has done for his Government and his country. 
I have had the privilege, Mr. President, of working closely with Dermot over the last 6 years, as many of us have. It has been an extremely positive experience, and I have come to consider Dermot not only a competent diplomat, but a good friend, and a good friend to this country. Without doubt, Dermot Gallagher is a consummate professional, an able and talented diplomat, and an individual who has served his country with skill and grace. And in no small measure, he has been assisted in that process by his lovely wife Maeve who has been a partner in this endeavor of theirs over the last number of years. 
It goes without saying that Ambassador Gallagher has had an extraordinarily busy and productive tenure as Ireland's Ambassador in Washington. From early 1994 until the present, Ireland, and particularly the Northern Ireland peace process, have been front-burner issues for the Irish, the British, and our own Government. 
Naturally, Dermot Gallagher has been in the thick of all of it. He has been an effective spokesman for his Government with the State Department, the White House, and the Congress. He has also been enormously helpful, I might point out, Mr. President, to those of us who have been actively involved in trying to get the peace process back on track in that country following the tragic decision of the IRA last year to break the August 1994 cease-fire. 
Ambassador Gallagher may be returning home to Dublin, but I am confident he will remain actively involved in many of the same issues with which he has become so intimately knowledgeable. I say this because Ambassador Gallagher will be returning to Dublin to assume the position of Second Secretary General within the Department of Foreign Affairs, where he will continue to play a major role in Anglo-Irish issues, especially in the Northern Ireland peace process. 
Given the recent events in Drumcree, where once again violence erupted, Mr. President, in connection with the annual Orange Order parade season, he will have his work cut out for him. Dermot will play a critical role in advising the newly elected Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, on the most effective policies for the Irish Government to pursue in order to restore a climate of trust, peace, and reinvigorate the currently stalled peace process. 
So, Mr. President, I know again I speak for all of my colleagues here when I bid Ambassador Gallagher and his wife Maeve and their family a farewell and a thank you for a job very well done. We continue to look forward to working with him in the years ahead.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to my friend and colleague from South Carolina, the distinguished chairman of the committee, and Senator Levin and others who have done, I think, a wonderful job in putting this bill together. I commend them for it. It is comprehensive, from a parochial standpoint. There are issues in my State that are addressed in this defense authorization bill which I think are extremely important from a national security standpoint, maintaining an industrial base, the teaming approach, the creative approach that the Defense Department has come up with that Electric Boat Division and Newport News in Virginia have joined together in a teaming process for the next generation of submarine technology that will allow both of those industrial bases to maintain their viability well into the next century. 
Mr. President, stepping back a bit and looking at the Defense authorization bill as a whole, I'd like to complement my colleagues, Senator Thurmond and Senator Levin, the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for bringing to the floor a bill that provides for the Nation's defense in a sound and fiscally responsible manner. 
Let me comment on several provisions of the bill in particular. 
First and foremost, this bill supports the submarine teaming plan which will save hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and keep our current submarine industrial base viable for the near future. The Navy estimates that this teaming plan will save $650 million, or about half a submarine, when compared to straight competition. That's a fact, and it has not been disputed. In this era of cost cutting, teaming on submarines is clearly the best course. Moreover, if at some point in the future there is enough work for full competition between two submarine builders, only the teaming plan will ensure that two submarine builders still exist. 
It is far too early, however, to become complacent on this matter, for high hurdles remain, but I plan to do my utmost to make sure that this plan, fully backed by the Navy, becomes law. 
On a related matter, I'm glad to see that we are on track in authorizing funds to complete the third and final Seawolf submarine. Just last week, Electric Boat in Groton, CT, turned over to the Navy the U.S.S. Seawolf, the first submarine in the class and the most advanced submarine in the world. It once again demonstrates that the Nation looks to Connecticut to produce the world's finest equipment for the world's finest fighting forces. 
This bill also calls for 36 UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters, a testament to the continued need for these versatile aircraft used by nearly every branch of the Armed Forces as well as a host of countries around the world. Also, these helicopters are ever-present in disaster relief operations, from the wildfires in California to the floods in the Dakotas. This bill will ease a bit the National Guard's massive shortfall in modern helicopters. Any National Guard adjutant general will attest to the outstanding capabilities of these helicopters, especially when compared to the aging, Vietnam-era UH-1 Huey helicopters many units may be forced to continue to use for the coming years. 
Finally, this bill holds off on more rounds of base closures and I support that position. Although I've stood behind base closure rounds in the past, we don't have a good handle at this point on the costs and benefits from those previous rounds, so I'm disinclined to go forward. The GAO has found that, while there are probably eventual savings that accrue from BRAC rounds, the specific amounts cannot be pinned down from the available data. Furthermore, GAO has found that environmental cleanup costs have been underestimated and revenue from land sales has been overestimated--both resulting in lesser savings than DoD had initially calculated. 
That is why I have signed onto an amendment offered by Senator Dorgan that has the support of both the majority leader and the minority leader. The amendment simply requires that we closely examine the data from the four previous base closure rounds as well as the shutdowns scheduled over the next year before we go forward with additional rounds. This doesn't seem too much to ask when we consider the difficulties that confront communities that surround a military base on the closure list. We owe it to those communities to provide accurate estimates rather than the more familiar overstatements of savings used to justify their extreme hardship. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, this is an amendment that was adopted in the other body's consideration of the authorization for the Armed Services of this country, adopted 417-0. But I thought it was worthwhile for this body to speak as well to this issue. 
I speak of the gulf war illnesses, Mr. President, that virtually every Member of this body and others have expressed deep concern about to the members of their own States who served in the gulf war. We know now that at least 10 percent of the 700,000 that served in the war may have been afflicted with a gulf war illness of one kind. To the credit of General Schwarzkopf and others who testified in recent weeks, it was suggested this matter ought to be pursued. 
It is mystifying and disturbing to many exactly what kind of exposure those men and women were subjected to. I do not know that anyone can tell you categorically what the answer is yet, but this amendment tracks some of the conclusions reached by the General Accounting Office that they revealed in a recent report about the gulf war illnesses. The author of the amendment in the House, as well as myself, tracked that report, drafted this language, and are asking our colleagues to support it so that we might not only get to the bottom of this and provide the kind of treatment that our veterans deserve, but also maybe minimize in future situations being faced with the kind of difficulties that we have all heard about in various hearings that have been held in this body and the other over the last number of months regarding this issue. 
This amendment, as I mentioned a moment ago, will provide, I think, some real solace, not to mention significant help, particularly help to the 700,000 members of the Armed Forces who served in the Persian Gulf war. And perhaps as many, as I said, as 10 percent of them who may be suffering from some form of these Persian Gulf war illnesses. It is a modest attempt to help those people. 
In a $268 billion defense bill, I do not think we ought to find it too difficult to provide $4.5 million, which is what this amendment does, to study the most effective treatments of gulf war illnesses and encourage efforts to replicate those treatments. If there is one thing I think this body and this Nation can agree on, it is to do better by our gulf war veterans. 
Clearly, our colleagues in the House recognized the imperative here. That body approved an amendment 417-0. 
Mr. President, let me just briefly describe this amendment and why I think it is necessary. 
This amendment will require the Defense Department and the Veterans Administration to work together to determine what is 
working in the treatment of gulf war illnesses. While the DOD and VA have taken an important step of offering examinations to all who fought in the Persian Gulf war, those agencies have not examined the adequacy and effectiveness of treatments after those initial examinations. 
Mr. President, let me, just as an aside here, suggest as well utilizing the forum of this body to urge the gulf war veterans to visit their veterans hospitals in their States to be examined. There are 5,000 people in my State who served in the gulf war. Only about 400 to 500 have showed up at the veterans hospital in West Haven to be examined to determine whether or not they may be suffering any of the effects of the gulf war illnesses. 
Many have had no effects whatsoever. But we are being told by experts that some of the reactions are delayed reactions, and they may not be showing up in the normal predictable course of events in a timely fashion. But if more people would just go for that half an hour examination, I am confident that the overwhelming majority will not find that they suffered any consequence, but it would be helpful for them and their families, but it would assist us immeasurably as we try to get to the bottom of this issue. 
This, as I said, is an amendment that would help us identify some of the treatments that are working. This is based on the General Accounting Office report that was recently released and called `Improved Monitoring of Clinical Progress and Reexamination of Research Emphasis Are Needed.' It clearly asserts that neither the DOD nor the VA has a mechanism in place to monitor the effectiveness of treatment after those initial exams. This amendment would provide such a means, one that I feel is long overdue. 
But it is not enough, in my view, to take just a close look at the present treatments. I think we must look ahead to make sure we do not repeat the mistakes. And this amendment will take steps on that front as well. 
For example, the Defense Department has been unable to provide the location of military units at certain times during the Persian Gulf war. Specifically, we are apparently uncertain of troop movements in the proximity of the ammunition depot at Khamisiyah when it was destroyed. 
That is why this amendment, I think, would be helpful in requiring the Defense Department to develop a plan to collect and maintain information regarding the daily location of units engaged in a contingency or combat operation. Had we done that during the gulf war, we would know where our troops were when the emissions of chemical or biological agents occurred. That is vitally important information. 
Furthermore, both the General Accounting Office and the President's Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses have highlighted the loss or incompleteness of military medical records. Now, years later, as researchers attempt to determine who is and who is not suffering from an illness that resulted from their service in the Persian Gulf war, the fact that in many cases they cannot piece together medical histories does not allow them to make an informed decision. 
This amendment, Mr. President, would therefore require the Department of Defense to put a system in place that would accurately record the medical condition of service members prior to their deployment and retain such data in a centralized location to ease future access. Again, this is a modest proposal that would have prevented, I think, our current difficulties had it been in place prior to or during the Persian Gulf conflict. 
Concerning the fact that troops in the Persian Gulf were given drugs that did not yet receive FDA approval for usage, this amendment would require that members of the Armed Forces at least be notified when they receive an investigational new drug. That way, if such drugs are required, at least our troops will not have any mistaken impressions about them. 
Finally, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It gives the Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs wide discretion and simply guides their action in areas where I think there have been some shortcomings. 
The final objective is a better understanding of the best treatments of these illnesses and to guard against similar problems in the future. 
Again, even though we have passed legislation banning the use of chemical weapons--the treaty--I think we all realize that this may be a reoccurring problem in the future. And this modest amendment, I think, would go a great distance to alleviating some of these problems. 
Again, I emphasize that this has been adopted by the other body unanimously. I think it would be worthwhile if this body were to express its opinion on this issue as well. 
For those reasons, Mr. President, I offer this amendment and urge its adoption. 
Mr. President, I am not asking for a rollcall vote on this. One may be necessary.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is an amendment that I offer on behalf of myself and my colleague from Arizona. This really is an amendment commending the people of Mexico, the Government of Mexico, and the people of Mexico as well, for this remarkable election that occurred just last Sunday which, for the first time in 68 years, has changed the political landscape of that country. 
One might ask, `Why are we offering a resolution on this? They had their election. So be it.' 
Mr. President, for over the last number of years, the only time the issue of Mexico has come up on the floor of the Senate has been in a usually highly critical way having to do with the issue of drugs, narcotics, and our concern there. We had a debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement; obviously, that provoked a lot of criticism. 
I thought it might be worthwhile for this body to take a moment out to say to our neighbor to the south, we applaud you as a people and as a Government for the election that you went through last Sunday. 
To those who were victorious, we congratulate them. To those who lost, we express our regrets for you. We commend President Zedillo for having embraced the results, who saw to it that a process was in place that would not allow the corruption that occurred in the last election when apparently people who were legitimately elected were denied those victories. 
The people of Mexico voted in strong numbers. There is a new mayor for the city of Mexico. Mexico, in the past, has not had freely elected mayors. 
So while we as a Congress have been critical of Mexico in the past, I think it is worthwhile to take a moment out to say, `Well done,' and that Mexico has done an excellent job here. It is the first election. We hope there will be many more like it in the years to come. Obviously, one election is only the beginning of a process, but it is good for those of us who wanted to see improved relations between ourselves and our neighbor to the south. 
My colleague from Arizona has spent a good deal of his time as a Member of this body interested in Mexico, not just from a geographical standpoint, although the State shares a border with our neighbor to the south, but because of his concern, as well, over the issue of narcotics and trade, the border issues which his State and other States in the Southwest face all the time. 
We are not reluctant, as a body, to raise our voice where criticism is due. It is worthwhile to take a few moments out and to offer praise where praise is due. The people of Mexico, the Government of Mexico, the candidates and the parties involved, I think, are worthy of taking a moment out to congratulate them on their election last Sunday and to urge they continue in that process in the years ahead. 
I urge the adoption of this language, and on this amendment, at some point, I will want to get a recorded vote because I am sure it will be unanimous, and I think it may be worthwhile to have such a recorded vote when it is appropriate and proper to do so.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for reasons that will become obvious as I engage in these remarks on why I am offering this amendment at this time, this amendment congratulates Chris Patten, who served as the Governor General of Hong Kong. We can wait, I suppose, a few weeks, and it might lose its sense of timeliness. 
I think Chris Patten did a remarkable job in Hong Kong. He was the source of a lot of criticism within the People's Republic of China and elsewhere because he spoke up on behalf of democracy in Hong Kong and established the first freely elected assembly in Hong Kong, which we are hopeful will be reinstituted based on commitments that have been made. 
I thought it might be worthwhile for us as a body here to express our appreciation for the job that Chris Patten did during his tenure as a Governor of Hong Kong. It was a remarkable and historic tenure. 
Before the July 4th recess, I spoke at some length about Chris Patten's accomplishments as the last Governor of Hong Kong under British rule. Much of what I said at the time I have sought to incorporate in the sense-of-the-Congress amendment. 
Mr. President, we all watched the pomp and circumstance on Monday, June 30, as the clock in Hong Kong ticked toward midnight. At 1 minute before midnight Hong Kong time we witnessed the Union Jack being lowered for the last time, and the unfurling of the People's Republic of China flag in the night sky. 
That was truly a historic occasion. Appropriately, the events were attended by representatives from governments around the world. July 1, 1997, will at the very least, become an important footnote in the history of the 20th century. 
Having said that, I think the U.S. Senate should also acknowledge what preceded those events--the very impressive accomplishments of the Governor, Chris Patten, during his tenure in Hong Kong. We should thank him, I think, for his service to his own country, but more importantly, in many ways to the people of Hong Kong. Simply put, that is what my amendment seeks to do. 
I hope my colleagues support this expression of our appreciation and congratulate him for a job well done on behalf not only of his own nation, the people of Hong Kong, but for all democracy-loving people around the globe. 
I ask for the adoption of the amendment at the appropriate time. I will reserve the yeas and nays. I do not want to take up time for a recorded vote unnecessarily.

Mr. DODD. Madam President, I understand from the distinguished chairman of the committee there is no objection to this amendment. My colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, and I offered this amendment. We are asking for a recorded vote here because in so many instances over the past 5 years when we have had votes on Mexico, every one of them has been over a negative issue. This resolution merely commends the people of Mexico and the Government of Mexico for the very fine election that they had last Sunday. I thought it would be worthwhile for this body to say to Mexico how much we appreciate and admire their process last week and hope it portends great news for the coming years. 
With that, Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, with Wednesday's passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Senate with some trepidation, has taken a number of courageous steps toward ensuring long-term solvency of the Medicare Program. 
Specifically, I believe that the adoption of means testing of Medicare premiums moves us in the right direction toward the long-term solvency of this critically important program. It is important to remember that this provision will affect only those seniors with individual annual incomes over $50,000 and married seniors with incomes above $75,000, on a sliding-scale basis. While some tried to portray this provision as a retreat from protecting our Nation's seniors, I view it as a step toward ensuring that our seniors will be well served for a long time to come. The adoption of this provision simply says that those Americans who can afford to contribute a little more for their health care should do so. Such a measure is surely needed if we are to sustain the safety net that Medicare provides to millions of senior citizens. 
While I supported that particular part of the bill, I must share my deep concern over other provisions that I feel go too far. I find particularly unacceptable the provision which will raise the age at which individuals are eligible to receive Medicare from 65 to 67. The likelihood of these seniors finding affordable private insurance is slim--many will be forced to forego coverage. At a time when the number of uninsured individuals in this country is growing and employer-sponsored insurance is declining, I find it astonishing that some would choose to exacerbate the current problem further with this measure. 
I also opposed a provision that will require the poorest and sickest seniors to pay up to $700 a year in home health costs. One-quarter of the home health users are over 85; 43 percent have incomes below $10,000. Forcing the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries to bear this significant financial burden under the guise of addressing the long-term financial challenges of this program is indefensible. 
Because of these concerns, I was unable to support this bill. It is my sincere hope, however, that these issues will be resolved in conference and that ultimately we will pass into law a measure that truly will protect our Nation's seniors and the vital safety net that Medicare provides to them.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. First, I would like to commend the Finance Committee on the job it has done. Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan should be praised for their efforts to craft a bipartisan bill, something that the House clearly failed to achieve in its tax-writing committee. 
The Finance bill contains many good measures, including a $500-per-child tax credit, which brings much needed relief to working Americans. This bill provides tax relief for higher education, making college more accessible to millions of Americans. The underlying bill also expands Individual Retirement Accounts helping many Americans to meet the financial demands of raising a family and planning for retirement. The bill before us today also recognizes the importance providing tax relief for businesses by extending the research tax credit for 31 months, encouraging more investments in research and development. 
In addition, the Finance bill provides funding for Amtrak, and creates an inner-city passenger rail fund that would help finance improvements in public transportation. This bill facilitates environmental cleanup efforts in many urban and rural areas, helping to make our country a healthier place to live. 
While I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues who worked so hard to craft a bipartisan tax relief bill, I am concerned that this measure misses opportunities to provide meaningful tax relief for American families. During Senate consideration, I voted for a number of amendments to make this bill more equitable. Some of these amendments succeeded. Many did not. 
In particular, I was pleased when my colleagues accepted my amendment concerning student loan forgiveness for people who choose a career in community service and public sector work. This amendment will help us to deal with the growing problem of student indebtedness. 
I also supported the Nickles amendment to extend self-employment health insurance deductibility to 100 percent. This measure will prove extremely helpful to self-employed business men and women. 
I was also pleased to support the Kohl amendment which creates a tax incentive for businesses to provide child care for employees. 
Each of these amendments make this bill better for American families. Regrettably, other amendments that would have strengthened this bill did not succeed. 
Most notably, I, along with my colleague from Vermont Senator Jeffords, offered an amendment that would have increased the child tax credit for most families by making it refundable for the many low-income families with little or no tax liability. It is a fair and equitable measure, one that would have tremendously helped our working families, and I am disappointed that this amendment failed. 
In addition, the Daschle amendment would have invested an additional $10 billion in education and more in the child tax credit. Unfortunately, this amendment was defeated. 
Finally, my colleague from Massachusetts Senator Kerry offered his own amendment to make the $500-per-child tax credit refundable against payroll taxes, a measure that would have brought much needed relief to many working Americans struggling to raise a family. Once again, an opportunity to make tax relief more equitable was defeated. 
Despite my reservations about this bill, and my disappointment in the failure of several amendments, I am encouraged by the fact that today, on the floor of the United States Senate, we came together in a bipartisan manner to enact tax relief to millions of American families. I hope that the conference committee will report a bill that is both fair and equitable, benefitting working families, small businesses and family farms. 
Finally, Mr. President, it is imperative that during the conference negotiations, we remain committed to preserving the integrity of the balanced budget agreement. The American people will not be served by a budget that achieves balance briefly in 2002 and then veers back out of balance afterward. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join a bipartisan group of Senators today in supporting the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. It brings us much closer to enacting legislation easing the tax burden which weighs heavily on too many Americans.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to say a thank you on behalf of myself and I feel a thank you as well on behalf of my 99 colleagues to his Excellency, Christopher F. Patten, the outgoing Governor of Hong Kong. Governor Patten has the particular distinction of being the last of 28 British Governors to preside over Hong Kong before this territory reverts back to the People's Republic of China on July 1--in just a few days. 
Chris Patten, as those of us in this body have come to know him over the years, is a truly remarkable individual. He has been a superb administrator and an inspiration to the people who he has sought to govern in Hong Kong. 
During his 5 years there, Chris Patten has watched the economy flourish under his stewardship. It grew by more than 30 percent in real terms over that period--a truly impressive performance. He has presided over a capable and honest civil service. Crime has fallen. The political situation has been stable and further democratized. 
These are all important achievements, but, in my view, the most important legacy of the Patten administration is that it leaves behind the seeds of democracy firmly planted in the minds and hearts of the people of Hong Kong. 
Thanks to Governor Patten and the people of Hong Kong, they were able to experience democracy firsthand by electing members of their local legislature, thereby making good on the British commitment to put in place a solidly based democratic administration. 
Sadly, Mr. President, the Chinese have already made the decision to dismantle the elected legislature and to replace it with an appointed council, hand-picked by Beijing. That may work for the moment. In time we will know whether the `provisional legislature' installed by Beijing is only a temporary setback to democracy or the first step down a very dark, dark road, indeed. I hope it is not the latter. 
Hopefully, Beijing will come to appreciate that it is virtually impossible to totally destroy democratic aspirations. As Governor Patten recently so eloquently put it, `You can dismantle institutions but you can't dismantle benchmarks. People now know what a fair election is like, and they will surely know what an unfair election is like if one takes place.' 
Many political leaders leave office, Mr. President, less than popular with those that they have governed, some deservedly so and others unfairly so, because they have had to make hard choices that only history will record kindly. 
Not in the case of Chris Patten, in my view. Although few 
have had to make tougher decisions than he has, he leaves Hong Kong enormously popular, with 79 percent of the people of Hong Kong viewing him as having done a very good job, indeed. 
On Monday, June 30, Governor Patten and his wife, Lavender, and his daughters, Kate, Laura, and Alice, will depart Hong Kong. I am confident that the people of that place will hold Chris Patten in their hearts for years and years to come. As one who considers him a personal friend, I would like to add my personal congratulations and thanks to him for all that he has endeavored to do, and I know that his many, many friends here in this body and the other and across this country, and particularly in Hong Kong, will not forget the challenges he has placed before the Government of the People's Republic of China.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, I come to the Senate floor to introduce legislation designed to send a signal to the Clinton administration that the current United States policy of banning the sale or transfer of sophisticated fighter aircraft and other armaments to Latin American countries--which has by and large been United States policy for some 20 years--should not be altered. 
The bill I am introducing today would call upon the President to respect the requests of a number of Latin American leaders and prominent political figures to maintain a moratorium on the export of United States advanced weapons to that region. It would also prohibit the issuances of the necessary licenses for such exports unless the President first certificated that such sale was in the national security interest of the United States and the Congress concurred with that finding. 
The Clinton administration is currently in the process of reviewing that policy predominantly as a result of heavy lobbying by those who are seeking to open up a new front for high dollar sales of state-of-the-art defense technology to countries in the Western Hemisphere--particularly those in South America. 
Mr. President, President Clinton has a record he can be proud of with respect to the Western Hemisphere. The 1994 Summit of the Americas, hosted by the United States, to which all but one head of state in the hemisphere was invited, was hugely successful. 
Since that time, the President, together with his colleagues throughout the region, has endeavored to pursue the hemispheric agenda that the region's leaders agreed to during the course of that summit--namely to strengthen democracy, increase trade, bolster national security and combat drug trafficking. 
I would respectfully assert that were the United States to alter our policy of arms restraint with respect to the region, we would be undermining efforts to implement those important hemispheric objectives. Heretofore, the President had been on the record in support of arms restraint, particularly with respect to sales to developing countries. 
Last year, President Clinton joined with other members of the so called G-7 countries at the Lyon Summit to underscore the importance of developing and transition countries giving priority to avoiding unproductive expenditures, in particular excessive military spending. 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is responsible for monitoring economic policies and balance of payments throughout the world, has also given high priority to warning against the dangers of arms purchases. 
Most recently, on June 19, during the Article IV consultations with the United States, where the performance of the United States economy was reviewed, the IMF staff, `urged the United States, together with other major countries, to administer their policies on military sales to developing and transition economy countries in a way that avoids encouraging unproductive expenditures and heightening security tensions.' 
It would be the ultimate irony, after all the time and effort that the President and his administration has expended in helping to plant the seeds of democracy in our own hemisphere, and in so carefully nurturing those seeds as they have germinated and bloomed, if he were to make a decision that would undermine all of those efforts. 
I believe that a decision to alter our current policy to permit the export of highly advanced weaponry to the region would do just that. Over the medium term it could only serve to disturb the delicate regional military balance and thereby pose a serious threat to regional peace and economic prosperity. 
Mr. President, if you were to listen to American defense contractors you would think that our current policy has prevented them from earning even 1 dollar on arms sales to Latin America. Nothing could be further from the truth. Between 1992-1995 the United States was the single largest supplier of weapons to Latin America, capturing more than 25 percent of that market. According to the Congressional Research Service during fiscal years 1993-1996, U.S. arms sales to Latin American nations averaged nearly $200 million annually. 
No one is suggesting that Latin American countries, or that Latin American militaries do not have legitimate defense and national security requirements that can only be met from foreign sources. I would strongly argue that our current policy is absolutely compatible with those countries being able to fulfill their legitimate requirements. 
Sales of appropriate U.S. defense articles and equipment have and should continue. 
But, collective arms restraint should also be a part of any effort by regional leaders to prepare their armed forces for their role in the 21st century. 
In that regard, I believe that the Governments of Argentina and Brazil deserve special recognition for the very significant progress they have made in this area. 
Mr. President, the region is at peace. Democracy is the order of the day. The demands on governments throughout the region to meet pressing economic and social needs have never been greater while government resources are severely constrained. Now would seem a perfect opportunity to make real progress in reaching a regional arms control agreement to deter future arms races, and thereby better marshal scarce resources. 
The entire region has just recently recovered from a decade of negative growth. And, while growth is now on the upswing in many countries, more than half of them currently have per-capita income levels below those achieved by them 10 years ago. The educational systems throughout the region need major infusions of resources to prepare the children of the Americas for the next decade. Currently, less than half of those children who enter the first grade remain in school through the fifth grade. This is a staggering statistic and one that needs to be changed. However, that isn't going to happen unless government resources are devoted to this objective. 
Perhaps that is why there has been no drumbeat from governments throughout the hemisphere that President Clinton abandon our policy of arms restraint. In fact, heads of state from Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay have publicly expressed their concerns about our altering the current United States policy. 
They know better than we do, the kinds of pressures that they will confront from their own militaries once this proverbial cat is out of the bag. 
One military instititution after another will seek to justify demands for more and more costly defense expenditures in order to maintain parity with neighboring militaries--in some cases militaries that they have been in conflict within the last 20 years--Peru and Ecuador as recently as 1995. 
I am strongly supportive of efforts designed to improve U.S. export performance. Certainly we all want to see U.S. exports continue to grow--exports are critical to the health of our own economy and are a primary source of jobs for hard working American men and women. 
However, I would argue that it is shortsighted on our part to push countries in the hemisphere to divert scarce resources for nonproductive, one-time, arms purchases. 
These resources could be more wisely spent repairing badly eroded infrastructures and on other productive investments that will reduce unemployment in these countries and generate domestic purchasing power that will provide for a more stable and sustainable market for U.S. nondefense exports. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that the legislation I am introducing today will call attention to the issues and concerns I have raised today, and hopefully will provoke a serious debate on the wisdom of altering a policy that has worked so well to promote U.S. interests in this hemisphere.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I send to the desk a joint resolution on behalf of myself and Senator John McCain which we believe will lead to more cooperative and effective efforts to meet the international threat posed by international drug trafficking. 
The resolution that we are introducing today calls upon the President to establish a high level, interdisciplinary task force under the direction of Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, to develop a comprehensive strategy for dealing with the supply and demand side of the drug problem. 
It also urges the President to encourage other drug producing and transit countries to undertake similar efforts. Within a year's time it calls for an international summit to be held, at which time, the efforts of all the parties would be merged into a multilateral battle plan to engage the illegal drug trade on every front. 
In order to create the kind of international cooperation and mutual respect that must be present if this effort is to produce results, the resolution would also suspend the annual drug certification procedure for a period of 2 years, while efforts are ongoing to develop and implement a new strategy. 
As you know, Mr. President, the issue of how best to construct and implement an effective counter narcotics policy has been the subject of much debate in this Chamber, and I would add much disagreement. 
My intention in introducing this resolution today is to try to see if there is some way to end what has become a stale annual event that has not brought us any closer to mounting a credible effort to eliminate or even contain the international drug mafia. 
We all can agree that drugs are a problem--a big problem. We can agree as well that the international drug trade poses a direct threat to the United States and to international efforts to promote democracy, economic stability, human rights, and the rule of law throughout the world, but most especially in our own hemisphere. 
While the international impact is serious and of great concern, of even greater concern to me personally are effects it is having here at home. Today, approximately 12,800,000 Americans use illegal drugs, including 1,500,000 cocaine users, 600,000 heroin addicts, and 9,800,000 smokers of marijuana. This menace isn't just confined to inner cities or the poor. Illegal drug use occurs among members of every ethnic and socioeconomic group in the United States. 
The human and economic costs are enormous: Drug related illness, death, and crime cost the United States approximately $67 billion in 1996, including costs for lost productivity, premature death, and incarceration. 
This is an enormously lucrative business--drug trafficking generates estimated revenues of $400 billion annually. 
The United States has spent more than $25 billion for foreign interdictions and source country counter narcotics programs since 1981, and despite impressive seizures at the border, on the high seas, and in other countries, foreign drugs are cheaper and more readily available in the United States today than two decades ago. 
So, despite the fact that we have had this drug certification procedure in place since 1986--more than 10 years--drugs continue to pour into this country and to wreak havoc on our families and communities. 
I think it is time to be honest and admit our international drug strategy isn't working and that means the entire certification process. Nor are efforts to revise the certification process to make it easier, politically, for the U.S. Congress to stick a finger in the eye of other governments by unilaterally grading them, likely to materially improve the situation--especially when we are not prepared to subject ourselves to similar unilateral grading by others. 
Rather, I believe that we need to reach out to other governments who share our concerns about the threat that drugs pose to the very fabric of their societies and our own. It is arrogant to assume we are the only Nation that cares about such matters. We need to sit down and figure out what each of us can do better to make it harder for drug traffickers to ply their trade. It is in that spirit that I commend the resolution that Senator McCain and I are introducing today to our colleagues. 
Together, working collectively we can defeat the traffickers. But if we expend our energies playing the blame game, we are certainly not going to effectively address this threat. 
We aren't going to stop one additional teenager from becoming hooked on drugs, or one more citizen from being mugged outside his home by some drug crazed thief. 
I would urge my colleagues to give some thought and attention to our legislative initiative. We believe it is worthy of support.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Daschle alternative tax cut amendment. First, let me commend the Finance Committee on the job it's done. Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan should be commended for their efforts to craft a bipartisan bill, something that the other body failed to achieve in their tax-writing committee. 
Clearly, the Finance bill is better than the bill offered in the House in several respects. However, I believe we can do better, and we must do better to assist America's working families. And that is what the Daschle substitute is all about. It offers families fair and equitable tax relief. 
And let's be honest: even in the midst of the strongest economic recovery of the century, many families at the lower income levels are still struggling. They worry about job security, pensions, meeting the costs of higher education, and finding good quality child care. Appropriate, targeted tax relief for these families can help them meet these challenges. 
The House and Senate bills, regrettably, shower most of their tax cut benefits not on working families, but on those who least need relief. They deny relief to taxpayers and small businesses in the middle and at the bottom of the income scale. The Finance Committee bill grants 65 percent of its tax cuts on the wealthiest 20 percent of the population. 
Mr. President, the Daschle amendment seeks to right these wrongs by bringing relief to working Americans and small businesses. Unlike the competing proposals, the Daschle amendment promotes fairness and puts working families first. In contrast to the Finance Committee bill, our amendment provides 65 percent of tax relief not to the most affluent 20 percent, but to the middle 60 percent. That's about twice as much tax relief for the middle class as the Republican Finance Committee proposal. 
Under the Daschle amendment, the affluent would get their fair share of the tax cuts, but no more. The top 1 percent of taxpayers would only receive 1 percent of the tax cut, compared to the Archer and Roth proposals which give 19 percent and 13 percent, respectively, of their tax cut to the top 1 percent of income earners. 
But fundamentally this debate isn't about statistics. It's about meeting vital family needs and providing additional resources to meet the many challenges they face. The Daschle amendment strengthens families and puts working families first. It provides payroll tax relief by making the child tax credit refundable against all payroll taxes, not just income taxes. An average family of four earning $35,000 pays $2,700 in income taxes, and another $5,300 in payroll taxes. These are the families who desperately need tax relief, and these are the families who would benefit from the Daschle amendment. This provision alone would extend the child tax credit to 10 million more children and families. 
The House Ways and Means and the Senate Finance bills deny credit to many working families. Families making less than $25,000 would receive no credit due to their negligible income tax liability. Further, these bills would cut the child credit for families qualifying for the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
There are few issues more critical to American families than education. The Daschle amendment recognizes this and provides $10 billion more in education benefits to working American families. The Daschle amendment provides more for school construction, more for Pell grant recipients, and more for tax credits for families to send their children to college. The Ways and Means and Finance bills provide less--less for school construction, less for Pell Grant recipients, and less for tax credits for families to send their children to college. I think we can all agree that unless we tap and nurture the talents and energies of all our people, we won't be able to meet the challenges of the 21st century. 
The Daschle amendment also offers fair and equitable relief to middle class investors, small businesses, and family farms. Under the Daschle amendment, all investors would get the same 30 percent capital gains break that the top 1 percent of income earners already have. This proposal cuts the capital gains rate nearly twice as deeply for most small businesses and provides much needed relief. 
Under the Ways and Means and Finance bills, however, primarily the wealthiest taxpayers would reap the benefits of an across-the-board capital gains tax cut. For example, a person who makes $45,000 would receive an average capital gains tax cut of $255, while one who makes $200,000 or more would receive an average cut of $11,520. Clearly, these bills are skewed to benefit the wealthiest income earners and disadvantage those who most need tax relief--working families. 
Further, the Democratic alternative targets all estate tax cuts to family businesses and family farms, in an effort to relieve the tax burden felt by many. Again, however, the Ways and Means and Finance bills favor the wealthy by providing $35 billion in estate tax cuts to the wealthiest 1.4 percent of estate owners. Clearly, Mr. President, we must do better to bring relief to a much larger percentage of estate owners in America. 
Finally, Mr. President, in the midst of providing tax relief that is fair and equitable, it is imperative that we not lose sight of our obligation to enact legislation that is fiscally responsible. The Daschle amendment allows us to maintain the fiscal discipline we have worked so hard to achieve in recent years, dating back to the wise decisions we made in 1993. 
The Finance Committee bill is heavily backloaded. The Joint Tax Committee estimates that the cost of that measure will explode in the out years, costing $830 billion by the year 2017. I have grave concerns about facing the prospect of losing some $830 billion in revenue. And that is why I offered an amendment during the budget reconciliation negotiations which demanded that we adhere to our budget agreement in which we agreed to a net tax cut of $85 billion through 2002, and not more than $250 billion through 2007. 
Mr. President, we must be committed to preserving the integrity of the balanced budget agreement and adopt a tax package that is fair and responsible. The American people will not be served by a budget that reaches balance briefly in 2002 and then veers back out of balance afterward. The Daschle amendment balances the budget by the year 2002, and does not threaten to push the budget out of balance beyond 2002. 
Mr. President, Senator Daschle's alternative plan is fair, it puts families first, and it stimulates jobs and growth. And not least, it is not a ticking time bomb that threatens to push the budget out of balance, blowing a hole in the deficit in later years. And that, Mr. President, is why I urge my colleagues to support this fair, equitable, and modest measure.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I want to commend my colleague from Vermont. This is an amendment which will be offered by the distinguished Senator from Vermont, along with myself, Senator Roberts of Kansas, Senator Kohl of Wisconsin, Senator Landrieu, Senator Snowe, Senator Johnson, and others. 
Mr. President, this is a modest proposal that is designed to do what all of us agree needs to be done. 
We have provided over the last number of years some 
significant support for child care in this country. For example, there is the Child Care Development Block Grant program which Senator Hatch and I authored back in the mid-1980's. There is also the Head Start program, which has been very, very helpful to so many families in this country in providing a positive learning environment for children. There is also the current child care tax credit. All of these are designed to provide assistance to those families today who are trying to juggle the very difficult task of providing an income for their families and also a safer environment for their children. 
Good quality child care can no longer be considered a luxury. There are 13 million children every day in this country who are placed in child care settings. There are an awful lot of single parents out there raising families. There are two-income families that are providing for their children. These families want to be sure that their children are in a safe place. 
We have done a great deal to help families with the affordability of child care. We have done a lot to increase the availability of child care. 
What Senator Jeffords, Senator Roberts, Senator Kohl, myself, Senator Snowe, Senator Landrieu, Senator Johnson, and others are trying to do is to use the Tax Code to try to do a better job of dealing with quality. 
I want to be very clear that there is nothing in this amendment which sets national standards for quality--as our colleagues over the years have had some serious reservations about setting national child care quality standards. This amendment simply defines a quality setting as one that meets standards or certification set by States, local governments or private, non-profit entities--we don't specify any standards--what those standards must be. With this amendment we just try to create incentives so that child care settings will get some encouragement to improve quality. 
Let me just enumerate what some of those incentives are. 
We expand the tax deductions for businesses who contribute educational equipment and supplies to public child care providers. 
We provide tax incentives to families who seek out higher quality care, realizing that such care is more expensive. 
Let me step back, if I can, for a minute. 
Mr. President, earlier this year, national magazines had cover stories on early childhood development. We now know that in the earliest stages of a child's life--zero to 36 months--it is absolutely critical that they be nurtured and cared for so that they can develop to their fullest potential. We've all heard by now about how the synapses in the brain of a child are formed --1,000 trillion of them just in those earliest years. Now we have scientific evidence of how important it is to read to children, to hold children, and to play with children in order to wire their brains for the skills they'll need later. 
Obviously, the best caretakers of children are loving parents. That is the best child care--be cared for by prepared parents. No one can argue against that. But we also know that there are a lot of these parents who can't be there all day with their children. 
So what do we do to proximate that caring, prepared parent situation when the parent is unable to be there? What are we trying to do? Do we leave the situation to chance and say to parents, `Good luck. Do what you can. Hopefully you can find the kind of care you would provide if you were there.' That is a difficult statement to make to parents since we all understand that not every setting is a safe one or a healthy one, that in fact there are vast differences in the quality of child care. 
Rather than applying any rigid standards here, however, we will leave to the States and to communities to decide what works best. And then we provide the tax incentives to businesses to contribute equipment and supplies to help to improve the quality child care. We provide the incentives to those parents who seek out quality child care because it can cost a bit more. In doing all this we will hopefully encourage other child care providers to improve their own quality and to ultimately raise the levels of quality around the country. 
With this amendment we also make the child care tax credit refundable because we realize that as we go from welfare to work that we are going to have a lot of these poorer families out there who are going to have difficulty affording quality child care. Refundability is critical--if we only provide tax credits to those who pay taxes, then we miss helping a lot of these poorer families who can truly use the assistance. 
It is certainly a lot more expensive to provide child care than it is to provide welfare in most States. So as people move from welfare to work, do we want them leaving kids in the street, where hopefully a neighbor or someone else is around to keep an eye on them, or should they be in a quality environment? I think all of us agree they should be in a quality environment and one that their parents hopefully can afford. 
Senator Jeffords has provided us with a way to reach this goal by using the Tax Code. It is not a direct appropriation. We realize how difficult it is to get funding for child care programs. Through the largess of our membership here over the last number of years, we have increased the child care block grant to $1 billion. That amount of money, but it does not even approximate the demand. And only 4 percent of that total amount is there for quality--hardly enough, really, when you think of the tremendous increase in demand for child care that is now going to occur across the country as a result of the enactment of welfare reform. 
This proposal is designed to provide incentives to businesses to set up quality child care center and to families to seek quality care. We pay for this by making minor adjustments for those receiving the tax credit at the highest income levels by reducing the credit progressively by 1 percent, but never going below a credit of 10 percent of allowable expenses. So by just adjusting the benefit a bit we can provide the resources here to promote quality. 
I urge our colleagues' support. This is going to need 60 votes, and that is a hard number to reach, but we ought to be doing everything we can to improve the quality of child care. This ought not to be a partisan debate. We have come up with an offset. We pay for this with minor adjustments to the Tax Code. This is a bipartisan amendment. With my colleagues from Vermont, Kansas, from Maine, from Louisiana, from Wisconsin and South Dakota, we have come up with a good proposal that we think meets the concerns that some have raised and still provides a way to ensure through the Tax Code that child care is not only available and affordable but also high quality. 
And so, at the appropriate time, Mr. President, when the amendment is offered by the distinguished Senator from Vermont, we would urge our colleagues to be supportive.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a modest amendment that will make a major difference to thousands of young men and women who chose careers in community service. 
As is well-known, the rewards of a community service job are not the salaries. Few choose teaching in Head Start, working for the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, or a career in nursing with the expectation of riches, big houses or luxurious vacations. In fact, for too many in these fields the salaries are substandard and pension and other benefits are questionable. The rewards come from knowing at the end of the day that they have made a difference in the lives of children and others in their communities. 
Many of these careers require post-secondary education, and today, higher education means debt. In 1995-96, total federal student loan debt rose to over $24 billion dollars; $264 million in my home state of connecticut. Nearly 7 million students borrowed to meet the costs of college. 
Mr. President, I believe we must do more about this problem of rising student debt. Not only are students deterred from pursuing rewarding, community-related work, but they and their families are also being scared off from pursuing the dream of higher education at all. This undermines our economy and nation as a whole; it is clear we will not be able to meet the challenges of the next century without harnessing and nurturing the talents of all Americans. 
For nearly 40 years, this is what federal higher education policy has been about--from the GI bill to Pell grants, the federal government has provided the means for millions of Americans to attend college. Rising costs, and the increasing reliance on loans to finance them, is beginning to undermine our central federal commitment. 
There are some good things, but many missed opportunities, In the bill before us today. The modified HOPE Scholarship should be improved and I support amendments to do so. The tax deduction for student loan interest, and some of the family savings provisions will also assist families in meeting the costs of higher education. 
But there is a great deal missing. Most notably, the President's proposal to support lifelong learning through a $10,000 tax deduction for tuition. This tax relief is critical to America's families and others pursuing higher education beyond the first two years. Continuing education is vitally important for nurses, teachers, technical workers and others. Yet this package does little for them to assist in these efforts. The Democratic alternative rightly restored this critical benefit. 
In addition, few of these tax advantages go to the neediest students and their families, despite the fact that this is the group with the most limited access to higher education. I hope that we can make progress on these fronts during today's consideration of this bill. 
Mr. President, this amendment also helps fill in the gaps in this bill. With rising student indebtedness, students literally cannot afford to take jobs as Head Start teachers, nurses or police officers. As a result, we and all our communities lose the talents and energies of these trained and motivated young people. 
The Dodd amendment supports the work of students who chose a career in community service by ensuring that they are not disadvantaged in the treatment of loan forgiveness associated with their work. 
It is not uncommon that public and private non-profit student loan programs provide for the forgiveness of a student's loans should that student chose to go into certain community service fields. For instance, the Federal Perkins Loan programs provides forgiveness for Head Start teachers, teachers in certain urban and rural areas, police officers, nurses, members of the Armed Forces and certain others. 
However, the Tax Code currently disadvantages those students who receive loan forgiveness from the private sector. The amount forgiven by nonpublic entities is currently treated as income, which can result in much higher tax liability for the student, undermining the effect of this important benefit. 
Specifically, this amendment would expand section 108(f) of the Internal Revenue Code so that an individual's gross income does not include forgiveness of loans made by tax-exempt charitable organizations, such as universities or private foundations, if the proceeds of such loans are used to pay costs of attendance at an educational institution or to refinance outstanding student loans and the student is not employed by the lender organization. As under present law, the Section 108 (f) exclusion would apply only if the forgiveness is contingent on the student's working for a certain period of time in certain professions for any of a broad class of employers, so long as a public service requirement is met. 
The exclusion also corrects an oversight in the enactment of the income contingent repayment option under the current student loan program, which provides low-income, high-debt students with the option of stretching out their payments over 25 years. This program allows students to pursue interests in lower paying fields while continuing to meet their obligations to the tax payers to repay their student loans. If the student makes payments for 25 years and still has a remaining balance, the Government forgives their loan. Unfortunately, when we enacted this vital program, we neglected to clarify that this forgiveness should not be taxable. This amendment would make this correction and fulfill the Government's promise to needy students. 
This initiative has been scored by the Joint Tax Committee to have a minimal impact on revenue and therefore this amendment does not require offsetting revenues. The administration supports this initiative and it is also included in Chairman Archer's house bill. 
Mr. President, I believe this is a simple step we can take to assist thousands of young people who chose careers in community service, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. DODD. We are very sensitive to these concerns, as my colleague has raised these issue on numerous occasions. I should have stated at the outset that the Senator from Indiana chairs the Subcommittee on Children and Families, on which I have been proud to serve as ranking member. He has been instrumental for so many years in helping children and families. I hold him in high regard on this issue. 
If I can read this briefly from the amendment for my colleague from Indiana--the terms credentialing and accreditation are used to refer to formal credentialing and accreditation processes by a private nonprofit or public entity that is State recognized (minimum requirements: age-appropriate health and safety standards, age-appropriate developmental and educational activities as an integral part of the program, outside monitoring of the program/individual accreditation/credentialing instruments based on peer-validated research programs/facilities meet any applicable state and local licensing requirements, and on-going staff development/training which includes related skills testing). There are several organizations and a few states that currently provide accreditation and/or credentialing for early childhood development programs, child care and child care providers. 
That language was drafted with help by religious and non-profit groups. We specifically provide that they may create standards. We have really gotten away from the notion that standards must be set at the Federal level. Centers and providers certified and accreditated by private nonprofits would qualify for the tax credit.

Mr. DODD. I do not disagree. There is an incentive. You still get the credit for using a non-accredited provider, but you simply get a larger one if you use one that has been accredited or certified. Our goal here is to try and get standards up for all child care setting, whether a home-based care program, a church-based care program, or a public setting. 
I am not arguing that a parent or a grandparent can't provide terrific child care. But, we just want to make sure that at least we are encouraging quality standards, whether State established or private nonprofit standards, to increase the opportunity for that child to get the proper kind of care.

Mr. DODD. Just a quick point. I want to point out this amendment of ours is phased in over 5 years, so there will be plenty of notice and time here for providers to try to get themselves ready to met quality standards. We do not rush this in; we allow time for providers and families to learn about and to prepare for higher quality care. 
My second point is that accredited or certified settings cost a bit more. If parents want to place their children in those situations, given the fact it costs more, our providing a tax incentive with a bit more of a break makes sense. I thank my colleague for allowing me to make those points to my colleague.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about an amendment that I have submitted with my colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato, to benefit firefighters and law enforcement officers in our respective states of Connecticut and New York. 
For the firefighters and police officers of Connecticut, this amendment seeks simply to correct a wrong that, while unintentional, has cost these committed public servants a great deal of money and anguish. It has always been the intention of the state of Connecticut to provide its police officers and firefighters heart and hypertension benefits tax-free by considering them workmen's compensation for tax purposes. Based on that intention, these individuals accepted benefits with the understanding that they were not taxable. 
However, the original version of Connecticut's Heart and Hypertension law contained language which made the benefits from the statute taxable under a ruling by the IRS in 1991. As a result of the problem with the state law, and through no fault of their own, these citizens have been charged with millions of dollars in back taxes, interest, and penalties by the IRS. 
Connecticut has since amended its law, but that change does not help those police officers and firefighters who received benefits prior to the amendment. This legislation would remove their tax liability for heart and hypertension benefits for the years prior to the IRS ruling (1989, 1990, and 1991). The bill is narrowly drafted to accomplish that limited purpose, and would not affect the tax treatment of benefits awarded after January 1, 1992. 
Mr. President, the police officers and firefighters of Connecticut serve our state's citizens with courage and compassion. The least we can do is provide them with this small measure in recognition of their bravery and commitment. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
The measure has been scored to cost $11 million for FY98 only.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to help communities that suffer when nuclear power plants operate in an unsafe manner. 
As most of my colleagues know, when the NRC discovers safety violations at a nuclear power plant, it is authorized to fine that facility for its transgressions, and these fines have been as high as $1.25 million. Under current law these fines go directly into the federal treasury, with no allowances being made for the communities that are home to these deficient nuclear power plants. When a nuclear facility is poorly operated, it often creates severe safety, environmental, and economic concerns for surrounding communities. Therefore, it is only fair that those communities should receive a portion of any NRC fines to go toward addressing matters of local concern. That is why I have introduced the Distressed Communities Support Act. 
This legislation is simple and straightforward--it would allow 50 percent of the fines levied by the NRC against nuclear facilities to be funneled back to communities adversely affected by the plant's mismanagement. 
The Distressed Communities Support Act would be extremely helpful to towns adjacent to nuclear plants which may be trying to develop special health, safety, and environmental programs. More important, this bill would help communities where the safety violations of the nuclear plant require that the plant be permanently shut down and decommissioned. 
It is a fact that nuclear plants around the country are aging, making it increasingly difficult for many of them to meet safety standards and remain operational. Therefore, it is important that communities throughout the country have increased access to resources to deal with problems caused by negligent nuclear plants. In my home state of Connecticut, the time to help local communities is now. 
The Connecticut Yankee nuclear plant in Haddam, Connecticut is in the beginning stages of decommissioning. In light of numerous safety violations, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered the plant closed until these safety concerns were addressed. Then, in December of 1996, the owners of Connecticut Yankee decided to permanently close the facility. This decision came despite the fact that the license for the facility was set to expire in 2007. While the owners of Connecticut Yankee had chosen to permanently close the plant, the NRC continued its review of the safety violations, and fined Connecticut Yankee $650,000. 
This early decommissioning of this plant will have a dramatic impact on Haddam and other surrounding towns. Connecticut Yankee was the area's largest employer and represented almost half of the tax base in the town of Haddam--a town of just under 7,500 residents. It employed more than 300 individuals. The sudden loss of tax revenue and jobs will have a devastating impact on this area, and the town may well be forced to raise local taxes and make cuts in town services, including the public schools. 
In addition to the economic impact is the serious health and environmental impact of the way in which this facility was run. The people of Haddam and surrounding towns are facing difficult days as they contend with radioactive waste and related problems. 
While local officials and residents are looking at innovative ways to rebuild their town's tax base, Haddam needs and clearly deserves financial assistance to get on the road to economic recovery. As we look for ways to provide financial assistance for this community, it only seems logical that some portion of the $650,000 in fines should go toward helping these people. 
It is even more fitting that a town like Haddam should receive some federal assistance, because the federal government is partly responsible for this town's problems. NRC Commissioner Shirley Jackson has stated that the NRC failed to adequately regulate this plant to ensure safety, and stricter monitoring could have prevented a number of the problems that this plant has experienced. A recent GAO report released by Senator Lieberman details the failings of the NRC in overseeing CT Yankee and other plants. 
In most every case where a nuclear power plant's negligence prompts a fine by the NRC, the communities surrounding the plant will feel some negative repercussions. Therefore, I believe that a portion of these fines should be available to the affected communities. 
While the Distressed Communities Support Act will not solve all of the problems of towns like Haddam, Connecticut, it is a fair and simple initiative that will provide relief to thousands of Americans. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I hope this amendment will be agreed to. This is an amendment I think all of our colleagues can support. I am offering it on behalf of myself and the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad. It will preserve the Medicaid coverage for some 30,000 children who, if we do nothing else, are going to lose it. These are the most severe disabled children in the country. This was a slip, more than anything else, I think, when we passed the welfare reform law last year. We learned these children might lose their Medicaid coverage as a consequence of losing their SSI. Since then there has been a broad agreement we should step in and try to preserve health care for the most needy of all children. In fact, the bipartisan budget agreement called for continued Medicaid coverage for these children. So, this amendment merely plugs that gap that we had all agreed on. It simply honors the agreement. Its cost is modest. It is about $100 million over 5 years. 
I can argue if we can find $16 billion to provide insurance for kids who lack it, surely we could set aside a fraction of that to provide insurance for children who stand to lose it. That is what we are faced with. If we do not do this, these 30,000 severely disabled children would be cut off.

Mr. DODD. I realize we are running out of time. Let me, on the Senator's time--I raised this earlier, I say to the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. We are not convinced that is the case. I understood that was the argument made to me and that has not been confirmed. So we are running the risk here, if it is not the case. I would rather adopt the amendment. If it turns out it is OK, then we protected these children. If you do not do it, it's not part of the $16 billion, 30,000 disabled children lose their Medicaid benefits. We have to do it by law, and I would rather err on that side than err on the other side.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment is very important to the hospitals across the country. Under the law, the first 
hospital that cannot provide care would have its fees reduced if the patient is sent to a second hospital that can provide acute care. That is a good idea. What happens, however, is that patients that are moved from the first hospital to a home setting, no longer needing acute care, the fees of the first hospital are also reduced. We did not intend that to be the case. This amendment corrects that mistake. This is broadly supported by every hospital across the country. 
My colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato, is my cosponsor on this, along with Senator Leahy. We hope it will be accepted.

It seems to me that proceeding with a degree of caution to make sure all the people that we want to benefit will be benefited and those to be excluded will be excluded properly, is not a lot to ask. 
I urge the proposal of the Senator from Massachusetts be adopted. It seems to me we ought not to be fighting over 24 months. We have agreed to means test. We waited a long time to get to this. Now we should do it intelligently.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the more colorful characters in my home State, Ron D. Aliano, who on June 24, 1997, will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the creation of his first business in Norwich, CT. 
Ron is renowned throughout my State for his positive attitude and his determination to tap the potential that he saw in the town of Norwich. He challenged Norwich residents to commit themselves to the revitalization of their hometown, and he is one of the leaders of this community's urban renewal. 
Ron Aliano is a man who believes that you can achieve any goal through commitment and hard work. He is also an ardent believer in the theory that, `if you're going to do something, you do it right.' The best illustration of Ron's commitment to doing a task first rate would be the Marina at American Wharf. 
For years, people talked about developing the Norwich waterfront, but these plans never amounted to anything more than talk. But Ron Aliano was the man who had the determination to make this project come to fruition. Before construction began on the Marina at American Wharf, Ron visited 86 successful marinas around the country to see what worked, and he tried to incorporate the best elements of each into his project. Today, boaters from Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, and all over Connecticut have rented slips in Norwich. Many people would argue that American Wharf is the nicest marina in New England, and it is the central spoke in Norwich's revitalization efforts. 
Another, more unique illustration of Ron's commitment to doing things first rate would be the miniature golf course that Ron constructed in downtown Norwich. Instead of windmills and plastic dinosaurs, this course is lined with waterfalls and finely manicured gardens. It even has a volcano, a claim that very few miniature golf courses can make. This course has attracted people to the downtown area, stimulating the Norwich economy. 
While Ron has worked diligently to develop Norwich, he also recognizes the fact that Norwich's strength lies in its history and tradition. As a result, he is deeply committed to preserving the town's rich heritage. In a misguided effort, certain developers uprooted cobblestone streets and destroyed several 19th century homes in Norwich, replacing them with a parking garage. In addition, many other deteriorating old buildings were in danger of being demolished. Fortunately, Ron Aliano and other members of the private sector invested substantial resources to purchase and renovate these old buildings, and Norwich is currently home to more significant historic buildings than any other city in Connecticut. 
Although Ron has been associated with a number of high profile projects in Norwich, his first business priority has always been his ambulance service, which will be 25 years old next Tuesday. Ron's ambulance service has enjoyed a dramatic evolution since its birth. Ron founded the company with a business partner, but, in 1981, he became the sole owner of the company and changed its name to American Ambulance Service. While the company started with only two used ambulances, Ron now operates a fleet of 21 ambulances, nine invalid coaches, two paramedic response vehicles, one watercraft ambulance, as well as numerous administrative and support vehicles. American Ambulance has provided ambulance coverage to U.S. Presidents, and this business continues to offer the highest quality care to Connecticut citizens. 
What makes Ron Aliano's passion for Norwich so unusual is that he is not a native son. Ron is actually from Bristol, Connecticut, and he didn't move to Norwich until he started American Ambulance Service in 1972. Therefore, as Ron Aliano celebrates the 25th anniversary of his oldest business, I think it is only appropriate that the town of Norwich, which once named Ron Aliano as their `Citizen of the Year,' should celebrate the day when Ron became one of its own.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the bill to halt the unmitigated spread of landmines sponsored by Senator Leahy and Senator Hagel. In particular, I laud Senator Leahy's tireless efforts in lining up over half the Members of the Senate behind this important legislation. Also, Senator Hagel's experience as an Army sergeant in Vietnam and his unrelenting support for veterans and the military make his leadership role on this bill quite appropriate. 
This bill would halt new deployments of U.S. antipersonnel mines starting on January 1, 2000. What better way to open the new millennium than to clamp down on these hidden, unmanageable devices that kill or injure someone somewhere every 22 minutes. 
Let's not lose sight of the fact that landmines kill and maim without impunity--men, women, and children alike will continue to lose their lives or limbs as long as landmines remain buried around the globe. That attribute, the completely random killing, sets these devices apart from all other weapons of war, with the possible exception of weapons of mass destruction. Yet, even a hydrogen bomb cannot kill a child playing in a pasture a decade after the bomb was dropped. 
Today there are 100 million land mines in 68 countries that wait potently to explode, be it tomorrow, years from now, or decades hence. More soldiers, U.N. peacekeepers, and children will surely lose their lives before the world acts to stem the tide of these horrible weapons. The question is: How many hundreds more must die needlessly before we pursue vigorously a treaty banning antipersonnel landmines? 
Late last year, the U.N. General Assembly resolved, without a single dissenting vote, to do just that. Having introduced that resolution in our customary role as world leader, we must now take action.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Abraham to introduce a resolution that will allow the National Safe Kids Campaign to use a small portion of the Capitol Hill grounds to provide a very important community service, a Car Seat Check-Up event. This initiative, called Safe Kids Buckle-Up, is a joint project of the National Safe Kids Campaign and the General Motors Corporation. Its purpose is to educate families about the importance of buckling up on every ride. Child passenger safety has received significant attention in the past year, and this program will provide parents and care givers with the essential information they need to ensure that their children are safely restrained in an automobile. 
Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of unintentional injury-related death to children ages 14 and under, yet 40 percent of kids are still riding unrestrained! More disturbing is the fact that, of the children who are buckled up, eight out of ten are restrained incorrectly. Each year more than 1400 children die in automobile accidents, and an additional 280,000 are injured. Tragically, most of these injuries could have been prevented. Child safety seats are proven life savers, reducing the risk of death by 69 percent for infants and 47 percent for toddlers. 
It will take a nationwide effort to combat this problem. Safe Kids Buckle-Up will be part of such effort. It is a national grassroots effort that will disseminate key safety messages through the more than 200 Safe Kids Coalitions, health and education outlets--such as hospitals and community health centers--and GM dealerships in all 50 states. Additionally, educational workshops and Car Seat Check Up events will be available at participating GM dealerships. 
On August 28, 1997, this program will be launched here at the Capitol, highlighted by a Car Seat Check Up for Federal employees, Congressional members and staff, and others from the metropolitan area. This event will kick off Labor Day weekend--one of the biggest travel weekends of the year. I am honored to be supporting this event and the overall program with my friend and colleague Senator Abraham. We urge our colleagues to support this Congressional Resolution allowing this event to take place. Protecting our children is a critical national priority that deserves national attention.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my admiration for the thousands of Americans who spent last Saturday morning running to help bring attention to breast cancer and to raise money to aid in finding a cure for this terrible disease--the leading cause of death among women ages 35 to 54. In Washington alone, more than 35,000 runners and walkers, including several members of my own staff, joined the Vice President and his wife to raise more than $1 million for breast cancer research in the Race for the Cure. This effort is even more impressive when you consider that this race took place in 77 cities across the country. Since its inception in 1982, the Race for the Cure has raised $45 million and funded 230 grants in basic science and clinical research, as well as education and screening projects. The incredible turnout for this event displays the widespread concern over the devastation of breast cancer. 
Every 3 minutes another woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. This year alone, more than 180,000 women will struggle with this disease, and more than 44,000 women will die as a result of it. One in eight women will develop breast cancer within their lifetime, making it likely that every American will be touched in some way by this disease. 
Until we find a cure for this disease, it is crucial that we educate women about the importance of early detection. If the cancer can be confined to the breast, the survival rate is 93 percent. Women need to understand the importance of mammograms, monthly breast self-examinations, regular exercise and a low-fat, high fiber diet. 
Mammography screening exams are the best early detection system available, and I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the reauthorization of the Mammography Quality Standards Act. Since it was originally passed in the 102d Congress, this legislation has provided women with safe and reliable mammography services. Through this reauthorization, mammography service providers will be required to retain women's mammography records so that an accurate medical history is maintained. In addition, it will ensure that patients are notified about substandard mammography facilities. It is crucial that we address this need, as early detection is often the key to effective treatment and recovery. 
Women who undergo treatment for breast cancer deserve the best and most appropriate care. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1997, another bill that I have cosponsored, guarantees that health care providers cover inpatient care for mastectomies, lumpectomies, and lymph node dissection. These procedures can be both physically and psychologically traumatizing, and we must provide these women with the option to have an overnight stay in the hospital after surgery. 
This bill would also require HMO's to provide coverage for reconstructive surgery that is necessitated by breast cancer. Currently, this reconstructive surgery may be considered cosmetic, but this categorization is illogical as it ignores the trauma that results from a full mastectomy and other breast cancer related procedures. Last, this bill will guarantee that HMO's cover secondary consultations when any form of cancer has been diagnosed. 
I know that my colleagues share my concern with the problem of breast cancer, and I hope that they will support these legislative efforts to help women prevail over this disease. 
Again, I wish to commend all those who participated in the Race for the Cure, and I only hope that their efforts move us closer to the Race's noble goal: a true cure for this debilitating illness.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I hope that Senator DeWine would accept my perfecting amendment that I offer to his amendment. I understand that the managers of the bill are prepared to accept it, if the sponsor of the underlying amendment has no problem, which I understand he does not. 
I believe that those who use violence as a political tool should not be rewarded with a United States visa for those actions. While his amendment covers a number of categories of individuals who have been involved in political killings and other illegal acts, there would seem to be two categories of individuals who played a very prominent role in the reign of terror that characterized Haiti between September 1991 and October 1994 when the duly elected government was restored to office with the assistance of the international community. I am of course talking about the High Command of the Haitian Armed Forces and the paramilitary organization known as FRAPH. 
Clearly members of the Haitian High Command violated every norm of accepted international law with respect to their efforts to overthrow a democratically elected government. But more importantly, their treatment of the Haitian people during the coup regime was reprehensible. Surely granting entry to the United States of such individuals would serve no useful private or public purpose. 
Similarly, the paramilitary organization which came to be known as FRAPH undertook such heinous acts as kidnaping, rape and murder as a concerted effort to intimidate the Haitian people. Individuals who were members of this organization should also be excluded from entry into the United States. 
Mr. President I believe that this amendment adds the necessary balance to the pending amendment and I urge its adoption.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to join with Senator Coverdell in introducing the Charitable Donation Antitrust Immunity Act. The bill would strengthen the Charitable Gift Annuity Antitrust Relief Act, which enjoyed broad bipartisan support when it passed the Congress in 1995. 
Every day across this country, charitable organizations help build better lives for millions of Americans. They are on the front lines in the effort to provide food, clothing, shelter, medicine, and educational support to less fortunate individuals. Their efforts help prevent our social fabric from fraying. 
Over the years, charities have used gift annuities as a means of making it easier for people to donate money. Generally, these transactions work as follows: a person donates money or some other asset to a charity and receives a tax deduction. The charity then invests the money and makes fixed, periodic payments to the donor. When the donor dies, the remainder of the gift goes to the charity. These arrangements help both donors and charities, and it was never the intent of Congress to unduly restrict their use. 
Regrettably, the benevolent endeavors of charities have been jeopardized by a lawsuit, Ozee and Richie versus The American Council on Gift Annuities. The lawsuit alleges that the use of annuity rates published by the Council constitutes price fixing, and thus a violation of the antitrust laws. The suit also alleges violations of securities and insurance laws. The plaintiffs ask that money donated to charities through charitable gift annuities be returned, along with additional damages. I have heard from a broad spectrum of charitable organizations in Connecticut and across the country who say that this lawsuit is undermining their ability to raise funds and continue their work. 
In order to save our Nation's charities millions of dollars in legal fees, and to preserve a critically important fundraising tool for charities, I joined with Senator Hutchison and introduced the Charitable Gift Annuity Antitrust Relief Act of 1995. With the help of many of my colleagues in both the House and Senate, we passed that measure quickly. The intent of the legislation was to exempt the use of charitable gift annuities from antitrust laws. Regrettably, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did not interpret the legislation in this manner and the lawsuit continues. 
Consequently, we now need to make a few technical changes to clarify the intent of the law. Although these changes would put an end to the litigation and ensure that charities can continue to do their good work, they will not make it easier for charities to commit fraud. The legislation would not change the antifraud provisions in Federal securities law or affect Federal tax laws relating to fraud. People could still bring appropriate lawsuits against cheats or swindlers attempting to disguise themselves as charities, or charities acting fraudulently. 
Mr. President, charitable organizations work hard every day to help fill some of the gaps in the American safety net. We must support their efforts. The Charitable Donation Antitrust Immunity Act will help. I applaud Senator Coverdell's work on this legislation, and I urge all of my Senate colleagues to help move it forward expeditiously.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1997. It seeks to correct the May 1994 Supreme Court Decision in the matter of Carbone versus Town of Clarkstown which has had a devastating impact on Connecticut and States around the country. This bill is very similar to the proposal that overwhelmingly passed the Senate in the last Congress by a vote of 94 to 6. It protects communities and taxpayers that have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to build economical and environmentally clean solid waste facilities --only to see those dollars now potentially lost because of the Carbone decision. Carbone held that towns and cities cannot control the flow of solid waste to facilities it has built or operated. 
In this bill, flow control authority, would remain with those communities that were operating or constructing disposal facilities or had contracted for such disposal prior to the Carbone decision. There is no prospective flow control; in fact, the authority would cease 30 years after enactment of the legislation. 
Approximately 35 States were adversely affected by the Carbone decision, which invalidated local flow control authority an issue that is vital to the fiscal soundness and public safety of States and localities. The Justices left it to Congress to reinstate flow control, and it is my belief that if Congress does not enact this legislation, States will continue to suffer environmentally and financially. 
State and local governments and State-created entities have a vested interest in how solid waste produced within their borders is transported and disposed of. Flow control is the backbone of Connecticut's integrated waste management plan. My State and many others had the foresight to plan ahead--to move away from landfills toward a more environmentally and economically sound system of recycling and waste-to-energy facilities. And it had been working. 
Localities made significant capital investments to construct expensive waste disposal facilities. In Connecticut, they incurred almost $750 million in debt. More than 80 percent of municipalities in Connecticut have contracts with the State's six waste-to-energy facilities. 
By 1991, the recycling rate had increased to 23 percent, but has remained flat since 1994. In 1989, there were 50 landfills, and today, there are only three, a sign of Connecticut's progress in devising a better way to dispose of its solid waste. 
Revenues from the facilities, used to pay off the bonds, were to be ensured by flow control authority. Without the ability to direct waste to appropriate facilities, these revenue bonds are in jeopardy. Municipalities entered into put or pay contracts--wherein they agree to dispose of a set amount of waste at a designated facility or pay a penalty. Now, after Carbone they are forced to pay for the shortfall created by trash moving to cheaper, less environmentally friendly disposal areas. Facilities in Connecticut are reporting tonnage reductions of more than 20 percent. That translates into hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue from reduced energy production and tipping fees--what the waste haulers pay to dump the trash. 
At a time when Congress is working to ease the tax burden on working families, the Carbone case will cause taxes to increase for a great many Connecticut residents if towns are unable to meet their trash quotas. Citizens would be forced to pay twice --first, to have their waste transported, and again to cover the put-or-pay requirement. 
This legislation strikes an appropriate balance between the interests of communities who must dispose of their solid waste and the interests of the haulers paid to move it. I am confident that if we pass this flow control legislation, Connecticut municipalities, and localities around the Nation will be able to administer their solid waste management systems in environmentally sound and fiscally responsible manners. 
I understand Senator Chafee is currently working to craft legislation on this subject. I look forward to working with him and my other colleagues to resolve this complex problem facing our States and localities. Furthermore, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.

Mr. DODD. I want to begin by commending our colleagues from New Mexico and from New Jersey, Senator Domenici and Senator Lautenberg, for their herculean efforts on this budget process. This is a very difficult task. 
I had--I say guardedly--the privilege of serving on the Budget Committee for a number of years, and it is more of a sentence than a duty in many ways, considering the laborious task day in and day out of going through the number-crunching process. I feel a special sense of appreciation for the work of those who serve on the committee, and for those who lead the committee in the case of the chairman and the ranking Democratic member. 
I would like to take a few moments if I could to discuss just one aspect of this budget resolution, one that has already been addressed by Senator Lautenberg, the ranking Democratic member of the committee. It is a provision that started out as a rather innocuous suggestion that was adopted unanimously by this body as part of the budget resolution and then became the source, Mr. President, of some controversy over the last several days. But the issue has been resolved, due to the efforts of Senator Lautenberg, Senator Domenici and others, to the satisfaction of everyone, including the author of the original provision, and that is myself. 
The budget agreement, as we all know, was reached by the President and the Congress and includes a number of provisions designed to protect the priorities that Americans care about while ensuring that the budget would reach balance in the year 2002 and thereafter. 
One of the stipulations of the budget agreement specified that the cost of the tax cuts would be a net $85 billion over 5 years and a net $250 billion, one-quarter of a trillion dollars, over 10 years. There was a letter, in fact, signed by the majority leader of the Senate, Mr. Lott, and the Speaker of the House, Speaker Gingrich, and sent to the President. I quote it here: `It was agreed that the net tax cut shall be $85 billion through the year 2002 and not more than $250 billion through the year 2007.' 
As I say, this letter was signed by both leaders. I was surprised, however, Mr. President, when the budget resolution came to the floor more than 2 weeks ago with no mention whatever of the cost of the tax cuts over 10 years. The resolution fulfilled the first part of the agreement by instructing the tax-writing committees to craft legislation that would cost no more than $85 billion over the first five years. But when it came to the understanding on the $250 billion, that had been left out of the resolution, entirely. That is a large amount indeed, a quarter of a trillion dollars. 
Mr. President, in my view, again, I think this budget resolution is a good resolution. I offered amendments to shift some of the priorities here. I lost in that effort. I wish we had done more in the area of early childhood development, Healthy Start, Head Start, child care. I will still make those arguments from time to time. But there are improvements clearly in many important areas of this budget. 
Even though I disagreed in part with it, I think it is a good resolution. But the provisions on tax cuts left me with a great deal of concern because you could write the tax cut part of this budget resolution, much of which I agree with, in such a way that for the first 5 years the revenue losses would be limited to $85 billion. But we all know how to write these in such a way that the second 5 years they could blow totally out of proportion and we end up where we were in the mid-1980s, again looking at a huge deficit. I might add that even with my language, there is no guarantee that that will not happen after 10 years. But at least over the first 10 years with the agreement we have reached here, we are left with an assurance that that is not going to happen in the short term, and future Congresses will have an opportunity to examine how these tax cuts are working. 
So this new language that will be included in the agreement, I think, will be a major step forward. 
I should tell my colleagues what happened procedurally. My amendment to put in place a cap of $250 billion over 10 years was accepted on a voice vote. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico and my colleague from New Jersey agreed with the amendment. It was adopted. In fact, Senator Lautenberg enthusiastically supported the amendment. It ended up in conference, but there was no similar language in the House version. But then John Spratt, the distinguished Congressman from South Carolina, went to the floor on the House side and instructed the House conferees that my amendment should be adopted. To the credit of many of the Republican Members of the House, as well as Democrats, they agreed with John Spratt. So he carried overwhelmingly in a House vote to accept my amendment.

Mr. DODD. Let me read from that letter: 
Furthermore, we can assure you that, consistent with the May 15, 1997 letter from the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate to the President which stated, `It was agreed that the net tax cut shall be $85 billion through 2002 and not more than $250 billion through 2007,' the 10-year net revenue loss will not exceed $250 billion. 
This language confirms the agreement made by the President, the Senate, and the Congress, as well as the sense-of-the-Congress resolution and the certification. 
Some may argue you have given up, it is not exactly law. I do not see it that way. I am satisfied people have made their commitments, and those commitments have been confirmed. This letter has been signed by the two chairs of the committee, and that ought to be satisfactory enough for people that we mean what we say in these resolutions. What good is it going to be to have a budget in balance by the year 2002 that goes immediately out of balance in 2003 because we did not keep an eye on the tax expenditure side of this equation? 
So, with this new language that Senator Lautenberg and Senator Domenici worked on here, I am very satisfied this is a good resolution. I believe that those of us who have been concerned that this resolution, while balanced in the initial stages, could end up out of balance very quickly, have seen our concerns eased by this progress. 
So I want to thank once again the leadership of Senator Lautenberg, Senator Domenici, Senator Roth and Congressman Archer, as well as Congressman Spratt, for their work in this regard, and lastly just point out, Mr. President, I know that there are legitimate issues that have been raised by those who say, `Well, what happens in the second 10 years? You can craft the tax expenditure provisions so they could end up pushing us out of balance in the second 10 years.' I cannot argue with that. That could happen. We will have to look at it very closely. Obviously, the economy could change dramatically in 10 years. We may have to come back and revisit parts of this. 
So there are no reassurances for the second 10 and there are those who will lay out for you scenarios that show there is significant ballooning, if you will, of those tax cuts in the second 10 years. We may have to come back and revisit that. But by putting in the net cap of $250 billion over the next 10 years, I think we have done a great deal to avoid the kind of problem that occurred in the early 1980's when no such caps were put in place and we saw as a result of the 1981 tax program a major deficit created in this country. 
I voted against that 16 years ago. I am glad I did. I think I was proven correct by what happened. I think we have avoided any likelihood of that occurring, certainly in the short run, here, and we will have plenty of opportunities in the Congress to respond if for whatever reason that begins to happen later on. 
I thank the leadership and my colleague from New Mexico and the Senator from New Jersey for this agreement and look forward to supporting the resolution.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a group of outstanding students from my home State of Connecticut. Each of these young people has been recognized by the greater Hartford regional YWCA for essays they wrote on the elimination of racism. As authors of the winning essays, these young people attended the second annual `In the Company of Women' luncheon with featured speaker Maya Angelou. I was privileged to attend that luncheon and meet some of the essay contest winners. Their words have inspired me and I am proud to share some of their insight with you today. 
Danalyn Elder of Weaver High School in Hartford, says `I do not consider color (except perhaps if I am saying it is beautiful.)' Courtney Yuen of Hall High School in West Hartford talks about dreams `* * * that offer a glimpse of a world without racism * * *' Richardo Solomon of Bloomfield High School quotes Dr. Martin Luther King in considering whether people can `* * * search deep down in their hearts to see a world without racism.' 
In her winning essay, Julie Meslin explains that `A world without racism would not be an easy place to live.' Julie concludes, however, that * * * `we would be pioneers in a movement that the human soul has longed for since the beginning of time. And it would be worth it.' Frederick Jelks of Bloomfield High School describes the pursuit of a world without racism as a collective effort of individuals regardless of race or heritage. This effort, he explains, `will not happen over night. The change will come about gradually * * * we may speed up that day when we can all kiss the glass of equality.' 
In his essay entitled `Color Me This,' Greg Binstock of Hall High School considers the innocence of a young girl who loves all the colors of the rainbow equally and sees no reason to segregate the black and red pieces in a checkers game. In a moving biographical sketch, Radmila Khamzina shares her experiences with racism in her home country of Azerbaijan, and her insights on racism here in America. 
Cheryl Vasquez of Wethersfield High School also uses personal experiences to share her thoughts on a world without racism. As a Puerto Rican girl, Cheryl has felt the pain of racism. In the end, she concludes that `A world without racism would be a world of more hope, a world of more dreams and a world of equality as God intended it to be.' Samantha Allaire of Manchester High School discusses a world without racism in which all employees receive equal opportunity and equal pay. This would produce a `more efficient and productive workforce altogether.' 
In his short story about a world without racism, Jamilla Deria of Weaver High School imagines a scenario in which his 
`Little Africa' is inhabited by people of every nationality, living in harmony. In this world, Jesus has `an afro and piercing black skin instead of having blonde hair and blue eyes.' This seemingly mixed up world is, in the end, `groovy man, real groovy.' Simshindo Msola of Weaver High School talks about the devastating effects that racism has had on members of the black community. The elimination of racism would enable African-Americans and indeed all people to perform to their fullest potential and `People would begin to have a positive and good attitude about themselves, and society at large would benefit and improve.' 
Nayoka Rose of Weaver High School sees a world without racism at `. . . the time of birth and death.' Infants lay side by side in a nursery, regardless of color, creed or heritage, and at death we lay side by side as `. . . death knows no color or race.' Michelle Davis of Weaver High School imagines a world without racism in which we would not have war, fewer people would be incarcerated and more people would have jobs. This world, Michelle says, does not have to be a dream. 
Mizzara Belton of Weaver High School says that `The thought of excluding racism from my world is a joy.' She envisions a society where the color of one's skin would not affect the treatment you receive in a department store, your educational opportunities or prospects for employment. Finally, Kelly Citroni of Bolton High School considers those who have died as a result of racism. The holocaust and slavery might never have happened, there would be no Ku Klux Klan, and Dr. Martin Luther King would not have been killed at the hands of a `. . . person prejudiced against his skin color.' Our world, Kelly concludes, would experience `dramatic change for the better' without racism. 
I am extremely proud of these young people and their thought-provoking essays. Each student is able to describe the beauty of a world without racism while sharing personal experiences and dreams. 
These Connecticut students are well aware of the effects of racism. Most of them have experienced first-hand the pain of hatred and prejudice. Their essays, however, illustrate the hope that lies in each and every city throughout our great country. One must only stop to listen to the dreams of our youth to see that blossoms of hope and optimism are flourishing among us. These young people can help us appreciate that we do not have to live with racism. If we close our eyes and imagine all people are one, we can envision the joy of a world without racism.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see my other colleagues here on the floor. I, too, wish to rise this afternoon and pay tribute to my friend and colleague from South Carolina. This past Memorial Day, we recognized the significant achievements and accomplishments of many Americans who sacrificed their lives for this country. In a matter of days, we will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the famous speech that Gen. George Marshall gave at Harvard University announcing the Marshall Plan on June 7, 1947. But this past Memorial Day, we also recognized a milestone achieved by our colleague from South Carolina, who became the longest serving Member in the history of the U.S. Senate. 
I was recalling the words of another famous American given in a Memorial Day address in 1884. Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, another great American known for his longevity, said on that day, `Life is action and passion. It is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived.' 
Mr. President, whatever else may be said about our friend and colleague, Strom Thurmond, he is a man of action and passion. That has been the history of his public life. It is a distinguished career that has covered so many milestones, many of which have been mentioned here this morning. 
One of his accomplishments which impressed me the most was the fact that at age 41, when a lot of people are preparing to play a round of golf, Strom Thurmond got into a glider and flew behind enemy lines on D-day as a volunteer. It was not required of him. He was not ordered to do it. But at that age he decided this is something he ought to do, to be a part of a major effort to retard one of the greatest threats in history, certainly in the history of this country, to democracy and freedom. A remarkable statement about an individual. 
I am also deeply impressed by the fact that he was elected to the Senate under four different banners: as a Democrat, as a Republican, as a Dixiecrat, and, the most impressive of all, as a write-in. The fact that citizens of the State had to go and write his name in, that they had to make the conscious decision to write his name on a ballot--it wasn't just a question of going in and supporting a political party--but for people to consciously go in and write his name on the ballot was truly a remarkable achievement. It is something that I think clearly demonstrates the significance of the affection with which he is held. 
Senator Thurmond has had to tolerate many things during his Senate career, not least of which, he has had to put up with two generations of my family. One of the dearest friends my father had when he served in the U.S. Senate was the Senator from South 
Carolina. In fact, among the dozens of pictures I have hanging in my office's conference room, I have just two pictures with colleagues of mine. One of them happens to be a photograph which I cherish of myself standing with the senior Senator from South Carolina, which he very generously inscribed to me, and he made special mention of my father and their relationship. I am deeply appreciative of the loyalty and friendship which Strom Thurmond shared with my father, who has been gone these many years now, some 27 years. He passed away that long ago. But theirs was a wonderful friendship. They didn't always agree on issues, but they did agree on some matters. They agreed about the great threat that communism and Marxism posed to this country and stood shoulder to shoulder in that regard. While they disagreed on other issues, there was still a great affection. So today I stand here, not just as a colleague from Connecticut, but on behalf of a family that deeply appreciates the loyalty and friendship that Strom Thurmond has demonstrated over these many, many years. 
Let me just conclude because so many other things have already been said which I would endorse and second. Strom Thurmond and I don't always agree on the issues. We agree on some, but not many. But what I love about Strom Thurmond, and what I think America and what the people of his State love about him, is not his particular views on issues that come and go, that pass with the time; these issues that are temporal. What people love about Strom Thurmond, what his colleagues love about him, Democrat and Republican, is that he is a man who, as Oliver Wendell Holmes described, is a man of passion, action and conviction. Whether or not we agree with Strom Thurmond is really not the point. It is so refreshing, at a time when everyone seems to end up sort of muddled, that you have an individual who has deep, deep convictions and is willing to stand alone and defend them even when he is the only person in the room doing so. Even to people who disagreed with him over the years, he ought to stand, as I know he does to our colleagues, as a monument to principle, to individuality, to conviction and to that passion and action that Oliver Wendell Holmes talked about more than a century ago. 
Mr. President, I am deeply honored to be able to stand here today. When Strom completes this term, he will be 100. I look forward to standing on the floor of the Senate with him sitting here, celebrating that milestone with him, I hope, as his colleague. The fact that he has been sent back here by the people of South Carolina eight times through all sorts of changes in the political climate in this country is a great tribute to the people of South Carolina. But I think all of them would agree with me when I say it is a greater tribute and higher tribute to the man who represents that State and represents America in so many different ways. I am deeply honored to stand with my colleagues to pay tribute to truly an American original, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a truly remarkable man who, on May 30, 1997, will celebrate his retirement after 38 years as an educator--Richard Lloyd Thompson, Sr. of Middletown, CT. 
Within every middle-sized town in America, there is a small handful of individuals that form the backbone of that community. Everyone knows and respects these individuals, because they are continually working to strengthen neighborhoods and help others. They always place the needs of others above their own, and they continually give of themselves to ensure that their hometown is a better place in which to live. Dick Thompson is one of these individuals. 
People like Dick Thompson are every bit as important to the city of Middletown, CT as major employers like Aetna, Pratt & Whitney, and Wesleyan University. He has helped to educate more than a generation of students in Middletown, and countless children and their families in this town have had their lives positively impacted by him. 
Dick has seen Middletown grow and mature before his own eyes. After teaching in the Hartford Public Schools for 10 years, he came to Middletown in 1971 to serve as the principal at Bielefield Elementary School. When Dick accepted this job, he entered a newly racially integrated school as the first nonwhite school administrator in the history of this school system. Through the strength of his own character, he was able to guide the school through a period of social uneasiness, and he has been an institution within the Middletown school system ever since. 
But Dick Thompson's contributions extend far outside the school. He has served on Middletown's Planning and Zoning Commission, their Charter Revision Commission, and their Salvation Army Advisory Committee. To illustrate the broad variety of his community involvement, he has been named an honorary deputy by the Middlesex County Sherriff's Association, and he has also served as a Middlesex County justice of the peace. 
I have been fortunate to get to know Dick personally through his involvement with the Democratic Party. He has been a local and State delegate for Middletown's Democratic Town Committee, and he has also served on Middletown's Democratic Nominating Committee. 
Despite the broad range of Dick Thompson's community service, the driving force behind all of his activities has been his concern for children. As someone who was orphaned at the age of 5, and who lived in an orphanage from ages 5 to 18, Dick is keenly aware of the needs of children and the positive impact that the surrounding community can have on a child's life. Dick sits on Middletown's Youth Services Commission, and he has taken a very active role in the lives of children through his service as a Deacon in his church. Dick has been a mentor for many children, and he has helped to instill these young people with a strong set of values that they will carry for a lifetime. 
As Dick approaches his retirement, I am certain that he would consider his commitment to his family to be his greatest accomplishment. Dick has been happily married to his wife Betty for more than 30 years, and together they have raised two wonderful children. Following in the family tradition, their daughter, Claudette Renee, worked as an educator of children and adults. She worked for Head Start programs in both Boston and Atlanta, and she currently serves as a technical director for an international corporation in Maryland. Their son, Richard, graduated from law school in 1994, and he is working as an attorney in the Washington, D.C. area. There is no greater source of pride for a parent than to see his children succeed, and Dick should be pleased to know that his pride in his children is exceeded only by their admiration for their father. 
Again, I want to congratulate Dick Thompson on his retirement, and I wish him the best of luck in all his future endeavors.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in strong support of the amendment offered by Senator Moseley-Braun to begin a vital undertaking--the rebuilding of America's crumbling schools. 
Mr. President, we all talk a good game here about children. We say time and time again that America's children are at the center of our efforts--be it education, job training, or tax policy. However, this amendment asks us to support more than rhetoric, it asks us to support the actual foundations of our schools. 
Unfortunately, our schools are in desperate need of help in this area. In the richest Nation in the world, we have schools without adequate heat or plumbing and leaky roofs. One-third of all students in this country go to school in buildings that are considered inadequate, and 60 percent of American students attend school in buildings that are in need of repair. There are schools just minutes from us here today, where whole sections of the school are unusable because they are too dangerous for children to be in. Beyond basic repairs, schools are also lacking electrical and telephone capabilities necessary to install computers in the classrooms. 
These problems are everywhere, but here are a few examples from my State. Seventy-seven percent of Connecticut's schools report a need to upgrade or repair on-site buildings to reach a good overall condition. Sixty-eight percent of schools report at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor, 32 percent inadequate roofs, 23 percent inadequate exterior walls or windows, and 29 percent inadequate electrical systems. One of the stated goals of our national education policy is to connect every school in the country to the Internet and teach every student to use the Internet by the age of 12. Well, I have heard from principals in my State who can only dream of computers in the classroom, and they simply hope to obtain a few telephones with voice mail capacity to improve communications with parents. 
Mr. President, this is a national travesty. We expect children to be ready for the 21st century, and we encourage them to stay in school, go to college, and work hard. But we are not keeping up our side of the bargain. Schools with no heat, plumbing that doesn't work, windows that don't open, and no capacity for technology--these are schools that fall short of anyone's expectations, particularly the expectations of our students. 
The amendment we are debating here today takes a modest step to begin to address this serious challenge. The General Accounting Office has estimated that over $110 billion is needed to repair our schools. This amendment would dedicate an additional $5 billion that would be significantly leveraged at the State and local level to $20 billion to begin this task and lead the way in this effort. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have an amendment that is on the list. I am going to do this very briefly to accommodate our colleagues who are anticipating a series of upcoming votes.

<TEXT>
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, let me explain, as I said when I offered an amendment earlier in the week, I intend to support this budget resolution. I think it is a good resolution. I commend the leadership for putting it together. There is some disagreement around the fringes. 
Fundamentally, this is a good agreement. I am impressed with the balance that is included in here. One of the ways this balance is accomplished is by limiting, of course, as we know, the size of tax cuts, both initially and in the latter years. 
The agreement entered into by the President, the majority leader, my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Lott, and Speaker Gingrich specifies tax cuts should cost no more than $85 billion in the first 5 years and no more than $250 billion over the 10-year period. 
I read from the letter signed by our distinguished majority leader and the Speaker. I quote from the letter, Mr. President: 
It was agreed that the net tax cut shall be $85 billion through 2002 and not more than $250 billion through 2007. 
As I said, this was signed by the majority leader and the Speaker. I was surprised, however, Mr. President, to learn that this budget resolution does not fully conform in a sense because there is no reflection of the $250 billion over 10 years. It does include the $85 billion over the first 5 years. There is no particular reason they should not be included. It was part of the agreement. 
In my view, the resolution ought to reflect the agreement. We do not specify, obviously, what is to be done. That is up to the specific committees; in our case, the Finance Committee; in the House, the Ways and Means Committee. All it does is conform to the overall agreement of tax cuts should not exceed $250 billion over 10 years. The absence of that reference in the resolution, I think, leaves open the question whether or not we are going to meet those guidelines. 
So, Mr. President, I offer this modification with reconciliation instructions so that the tax cuts are not limited to $85 billion but also be limited to $250 billion in 10 years. This language would be binding, but not in the sense of how it is done. We are not out of the woods, obviously, at the end of 10 years. There are reports we could have a ballooning problem, as we did after the 1981 agreement. I think by including the $250 billion here, it does conform very explicitly, as I said, with the letter.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, so my colleagues can appreciate this, this is not gamesmanship or trying to be cute about this in any way, but merely to have our reconciliation instructions conform to what the letter says we do. I think that would certainly put everyone at ease about the commitments we are all making to this resolution when it comes to deficit reduction. 
The great tragedy would be if we got to the end of 5 years and have no requirement that we try to limit it to $250 billion at the end of 10 years, and you have deficit reduction and balance for 1 year, and then it will explode out of proportion after that period of time. That is the reason for the amendment. 
I appreciate, again, my colleague providing me these few minutes to explain the amendment.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills which seek to address one of the most critical problems tearing at the fabric of American society: substance abuse. When we consider health care costs, lost time on the job, increased crime, and other related factors, it is estimated that drug and alcohol abuse cost this Nation more than $300 billion in 1993. While some efforts to address this problem have been successful, there is still a great deal of work to be done. The two bills that I am introducing, the Services for Children of Substance Abusers Act and the Substance Abuse Treatment for Adolescents Act, seek to provide additional tools for families to fight the battle of addiction and its debilitating social consequences. 
Addiction threatens the American family in several ways. The long term emotional health of an individual is shaped during childhood, and the children of substance abusers face numerous obstacles during their development. The children of substance abusers are typically deprived of the parent's attention and concern, and often the financial support to provide food, clothing, and shelter. In the most dramatic cases, children are exposed to substances prenatally and are deprived of a healthy future before they are even born. 
An estimated 7 million children are growing up with at least one substance abusing parent, and more than 200,000 women who gave birth in the United States in 1992 used illegal drugs at some time during their pregnancy. In addition, alcohol consumption by pregnant women has recently surged, despite public campaigns about the effects of alcohol on the developing fetus. Clearly these parents will need help if they hope to overcome their addictions and raise healthy children. Unfortunately, these parents often face several obstacles on the road to recovery. 
The basic problem with our current drug and alcohol treatment programs is that they fail to address the wide range of problems that addicted parents face. Many were physically or sexually abused as children. Many are victims of domestic violence. Many lack any formal job skills. Many will need child care assistance if they hope to enroll in a treatment program. Many fear that they will lose their children if they come forward for treatment. In short, these parents face several problems which extend far beyond their addictions. 
The Children of Substance Abusers Act is currently authorized in the Public Health Services Act, but it has never been funded. Today, I introduce a revised version of this legislation that seeks to give families affected by substance abuse somewhere to turn. The heart of the bill is the grant program which will provide $50 million for a comprehensive range of health, developmental, and social services to children, parents, and other family members. These services will enhance the ability of parents to access drug and alcohol treatment and promote family preservation, where appropriate. 
The bill ensures that all children whose parents are substance abusers can enter the program and receive a range of services. The legislation addresses another critical need by providing grants to train professionals, child welfare workers, and other providers serving children to identify and address the effects of familial substance abuse. 
For years we have talked about the impact of substance abuse on families. We have all visited the neonatal intensive care units, and we have all seen reports on children who were abused and neglected because their parents were on drugs. The time has come for Congress to respond to what is going on in this country and take an aggressive step toward alleviating these problems. 
The Children of Substance Abusers Act is critical to our efforts to reach out to those families that are struggling with substance abuse, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation I introduce today and fund this critical program. 
On another front, the increased prevalence of substance abuse among young Americans poses an additional public health crisis. Last year, the percentage of teens using drugs within the past month rose from 8.2 to 10.9 percent, and the rate of drug use among 12 to 17 year-olds has doubled since 1992. I am particularly disappointed to learn that Connecticut's students report higher rates of drug use than their peers nationwide. 
Annually, more than 400,000 Americans under the age of 18 are in need of treatment, and in Connecticut approximately 6,700 students need substance abuse treatment. However, young people have few places to turn. Most treatment programs are designed for adults, and there are limited resources available for the treatment of adolescents with drug and alcohol problems. 
Federal and state initiatives have focused on preventing children from becoming substance abusers. While prevention efforts are effective and necessary, they do not provide for those adolescents with substance abuse problems. In addition, most substance abusing adolescents have co-occurring disorders, such as depression, learning disabilities, post-traumatic stress disorders, and other health problems which make treatment even more challenging. 
The Substance Abuse Treatment for Adolescents Act seeks to create a funding stream for adolescent treatment. This would be the first time that any money has ever been earmarked specifically for adolescent treatment, setting aside an estimated $70 million annually to address this problem. This bill would also eliminate the need within the public system for adolescent providers to compete with other groups for scarce treatment dollars, thereby allowing them to focus upon the real problem: successfully treating adolescent substance abusers. 
Mr. President, this legislation marks a significant step on the road toward improved treatment for adolescent substance abuse. It tells families that we care about their children's health and well-being, and it sends a signal to those individuals who struggle to help our kids overcome addiction that their hard work is not for naught, but will soon be rewarded.

Mr. DODD. Yes, Madam President. 
If my colleague will yield, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the budget proposal generally, and then I will be offering an amendment on behalf of myself and the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] and others. We have not reached any agreement on time, but I am sensitive to the needs of the committee to move along. I don't intend to take a long time on the amendment.

Mr. DODD. Madam President, I would like to spend a few minutes on the overall budget agreement. I know several of my colleagues have talked about it earlier today. 
I had the privilege of serving on the Budget Committee for a number of years with the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Domenici, and my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, and my colleague from South Carolina, whom I see on the floor, Senator Hollings, and others. 
It was involuntary servitude, I would say. Serving on the Budget Committee was not a position that I sought at all. I was asked to go on the committee and I served there for a number of years. I enjoyed my service. But it can be a thankless task in many ways to be on the Budget Committee. 
So, I begin these brief remarks by commending the chairman of the committee and the ranking Democrat, Senator Lautenberg, for their tremendous effort. It is not easy to put these agreements together, this year in particular. Over the last several months, we have seen a major effort here to come up with a budget agreement that would bring the Federal budget into balance over the next 5 years. I commend them for their efforts. 
I must say that despite reservations that we all have, I don't know of a single Member of this body who wouldn't have written a different agreement had they been king or queen for a day. 
So I begin by complimenting my colleagues and endorsing their 
work with reservations. I will offer an amendment to do a bit better for Head Start, Healthy Start and child care issues. 
I support this agreement. Obviously, I am going to watch what happens in the amendment process and reserve final judgment. I respect, as well, my colleagues on both sides who will have strong feelings about this agreement. But, as it stands today, I think the authors have done a pretty good job with this budget agreement. 
In 1981, I voted against that budget agreement. In my view, that deal went way too far. As has been pointed out already, this agreement is vastly different from the 1981 agreement that created such huge deficits from which we still are recovering. In many ways, today's agreement is an effort to really try to solve the problem that began back almost 16 years ago with that vote and the problems which were created by that legislation. 
David Stockman, who many may have forgotten, was the Director of the Office of Management and Budget at that time. He has since written a wonderful book about that agreement, `The Triumph of Politics,' which I strongly urge my colleagues to read if they want to know the history of what happened in 1981 when this earlier agreement was reached causing the deficit to reach the magnitude that we have seen in the last number of years. 
So this agreement I think needs to be seen in a broader context. It is the culmination of a 4-year effort by the President and supporters in this body and the other to try to come up with a budget that would protect American families, that would allow us to reduce that deficit and reduce interest rates, which are like a tremendous tax people pay when they buy homes or automobiles. Obviously, as we have seen over the last several years, the declining deficit has contributed significantly to the growth and expansion in this country. 
When the President came to office 4 years ago we had an annual deficit of some $290 billion. That annual deficit has been reduced to $67 billion, a major achievement over the last 4 years that has brought significant prosperity to this country. We have seen 12 million new jobs created, the lowest average inflation since John F. Kennedy was President; median family income rise over $1,600, and the list goes on and on of effects of the improved economy in this country. 
Without this progress, obviously, we would never have what we have today, and that is the first credible chance in a generation to actually eliminate the deficit completely. I believe that we must take advantage of this chance, and that is why I will support this resolution, provided that it is not amended beyond recognition. It is a good framework for a budget that achieves real balance while protecting our Nation's most important priorities. It is, of course, as I said only a framework. We will have to see what the details will be before ultimate passage. 
Obviously, there will be two sets of debates, the one that we will go through on the outlay side, and then, of course, on the tax-cut proposals, the specifics of which we will not see until the fall, and that will be another debate. I myself am going to be interested, as my colleagues will be, to see the details of the tax plan that is passed by the Finance Committee. 
Any final tax bill should be designed, I think all of us would agree, so that its cost in the out years is limited. And I listened very carefully to the remarks of my colleague from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes. I know my colleague from South Carolina will address this issue in part. Their concerns should not go unheeded because there is a legitimate concern about what happens at the end of this process. And if we end up where we were at the end of the 1981 process, with an explosion in the deficit, obviously, we may look back on this agreement and wish we had done otherwise. 
But nonetheless, I think it strikes a good balance here with tax cuts in the education field. I for one might reserve any tax cuts until we actually got down to zero. I think there is a lot of legitimacy in that argument. But I accept the notion that that is not going to happen, that we are going to have some tax cuts here, and some, like the postsecondary education tax cuts, can actually be helpful to many families. 
I would note as well that in addition to these tax cuts, there are large increases in discretionary spending on education. For instance, the Pell grant is increased to a historic high of $3,000 a year. Many of us have fought for this program, which we think is tremendously important, for years. There also is real progress in the area of children's health insurance. Obviously, we will have a chance with the Kennedy-Hatch proposal tomorrow to do even more in that regard. But nonetheless, I would be less than honest if I did not commend the budgeters for doing a lot in moving in the right direction. 
Madam President, I think the budget agreement is pretty good and one that I think is going to help the country. This has not been an easy process. There have been weeks and weeks of discussion. I respect that. I also respect the fact that each and every one of us here as individual Members of this body have the right certainly and obligation where we disagree to offer some changes to this agreement. 
And so for those reasons I will be offering an amendment that will increase funding for Head Start, Healthy Start, and child care. 
These are three issues that I have spent a good part of my entire career in this body working on. In fact, the Presiding Officer and I, in years past, worked on a number of issues together, as I have with a number of my colleagues here. I never would have passed the original child care development block grant legislation if it had not been for my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, who joined in bringing that bill together. 
On the issue of Head Start, there have been a lot of people here who supported the efforts over the years to do more. I noted in this budget, there is a determination to serve 1 million children by 2002 in Head Start. That is certainly progress; it is an increase of 200,000 over where we are today. But I think we can do better over 5 years. We should ensure that all eligible children are served. We know it works so well and makes such a difference in children's lives. Particularly now with welfare reform, we are going to have so many more families that are going to need to have child care or Head Start. It is clear we are coming up short in this area. Serving 1 million children in Head Start is a laudable goal--but it is far short of what is needed. With this amendment over 1.4 million children eligible and in need would receive Head Start services. 
In addition, this amendment would triple the size of the Early Head Start Program, which serves that critical zero to 3 group. We see so many of these families now that have these new infants, with Early Head Start, we can make a real difference in these children and their families to provide them a safe, quality environment where these infants will be while the parents go to work. 
Welfare reform is all about getting people off welfare and into jobs. However, we know, and the Governors tell us, there will be tremendous need in the child care area. If we are going to move these families off welfare and public assistance into a working environment, there must be someone to care for these children. 
I do not know of anyone who disagrees with that. No one wants to see children wander neighborhoods or in makeshift baby-sitting operations. In every State, there are horror stories of what has happened when parents have left children unattended and uncared for. We have had dreadful stories in my State in the last year alone; some five deaths have occurred in these settings that are far from high quality. I am not suggesting you are going to solve every one of those problems, but at a most basic level, none of us here could come to work each day if we had a child that we did not have someone to care for. We would miss votes, we would miss committee hearings, if it were a question of placing our child in a unsafe environment. And there is not one of our constituents who would disagree with that. We would be indicted publicly for irresponsibility. 
This is a fine agreement, but we can do better in this area. This amendment would provide Head Start to 400,000 more children, it doubles the size of the child care development block grant and addresses infant mortality. When we are talking about $85 billion in tax cuts--and I do not disagree with that--do not tell me we cannot find over 5 years less than $15 billion to deal with Early Head Start, Head Start, Healthy Start, and child care so that these kids and families can really have the kind of support they need in their lives. 
That is the intent of this amendment that I am offering on behalf of myself, Senator Jeffords, Senator Murray, Senator Bingaman, Senator Well- stone, and Senator Landrieu to this resolution. We think it is a modest request to make. It is not as if we do not respect the work of the Budget Committee. I also feel we can do a bit better here. 
I support the hard work of those who put this agreement together, but let us not suggest somehow that this is totally inviolate. Some suggestions we might offer here would make this a better bill in our view. I think quality child care is one of those issue. I know very few of my colleagues who disagree with that. I know of no one who disagrees with Head Start, the work its 
done, and the Early Head Start Program. A few more dollars here, shaving off a bit on one end to provide a bit more on the other is really not too much to ask to make this agreement that much more worthwhile.

Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I don't know how many Members want to speak on this, and there may not be that many. So rather than trying to spend the time negotiating an agreement, why not let it roll a little while on the bill; we just got underway, and see how it comes out. We may not need a time agreement. There is probably going to be just on this amendment 45 minutes, just the three of us on the floor who I know are sponsors of the amendment, and I presume Senator Jeffords is coming over, and there may be a couple of others. So we will try to move quickly. It is not my desire--I understand what the chairman wants to do, and we will try to move as fast as we can.

<TEXT>
Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator. 
Madam President, the amendment I have sent to the desk that is under consideration basically says I think we can do a little bit more here. That is basically what it comes down to. As I said earlier, it is not to be offered to undo the budget agreement that has been struck by the committee along with the President. I respect and support that agreement. 
I think we can do a bit more when it comes to investing in our most important resource. Statements are made over and over on the floor of this Chamber, about America's children. I do not know anyone who would list a higher priority than doing what we can to serve the most innocent in our society, who have the most in front of them. There is no lack of people expressing an interest in the subject matter today. 
I recall going back some 15 to 16 years ago when Senator Specter of Pennsylvania and I formed the first children's caucus of the Senate. We had a difficult time, but we tried to convince people over the years that this was a worthwhile endeavor in which to engage on child care, on the issue of Head Start, and family and medical leave. No one would believe it today, but back then we had to fight hard just to form a caucas. Fortunately, we were successful in that effort as well as in the effort to pass critical legislation on issues affecting families and their children. 
Today, few argue against these initiatives. Most people agree in our society, as we look to the 21st century, that we want to give our children the best start they can possibly have. We cannot guarantee them success. No one can be guaranteed that in our society. But we want to guarantee them an opportunity. 
What we are talking about with Healthy Start, Early Head Start, Head Start, and quality child care is trying to give children a good start, the best start we can so they will at least have the opportunity for success. 
In that regard, the amendment I am offering increases funding for three children's programs that strike at the very heart of the most basic needs of children in our Nation: Head Start, Healthy Start, and child care. These three programs truly are sound investments and, I think, time tested. These are not new ideas. They have been around now, in the case of Head Start, a generation. We have had the benefit of analyzing the programs and know they work. 
In the case of child care, it has been over a decade, and Healthy Start, almost as long. We know from recent scientific findings that creative, positive environments for children in their earliest years is an investment that yields tremendous returns in the long term. 
We are now engaged in the process of laying out this Nation's priorities for the next 5 years. In addition to numbers, we are laying out where are our priorities, where do we believe the most important things that need to be addressed over the next half decade are. We managed to find $85 billion in tax cuts intended to spur investment. While I do not necessarily disagree with that, I think it can be tremendously helpful and important. But I believe we can certainly find an additional $14.6 billion over the next 5 years to improve the investment of children, and that is what I am talking about. 
This amendment would provide for full funding of Head Start by the year 2002. The President's budget and the budget agreement take a positive step in this direction by committing, as I said, to serve 1 million children over the next 5 years. That is up from 800,000 currently to 1 million in 2002, 200,000 additional slots. I think we can do better. This amendment would ensure that all eligible children who need Head Start will get it. By increasing funding to $11.2 billion in the year 2002, Head Start could reach over 1.4 million children. That is 400,000 more who would be reached than under the budget agreement. 
As my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, related the other day, in Albuquerque, NM, they have a staggering number of children waiting to get into Head Start and were unable to because the resources were not there. I am sure that story can be repeated in every State in the country, where parents are trying to get their children into the programs. 
Going from 800,000, where we are today, to 1 million, 1.4 million over the next 5 years ought not be an impossibility for us to achieve in this country. 
This amendment would also triple funding for Early Head Start 
programs to $560 million by the year 2002. This program, which my colleagues certainly recall, provides high-quality child development for infants and toddlers ages zero to 3. Again, I am preaching to the choir here, I presume, because of the tremendous amount of new information on this 36-month period that occurs in a child's life, to see to it that they get the quality care and development they need. 
This amendment that I have offered on behalf of myself and Senator Jeffords, along with others, would also make an investment in quality child care. It would double the size of the child care development block grant to $2 billion annually and provide an additional $500 million each year to help increase quality and meet supply shortages in critically underserved types of care, including infant care and nontraditional hours. 
I heard my colleague from Minnesota speak on the need for child care during nontraditional hours. Most people think of people working from 8 to 5. However, there are a vast number of people in our country who do not work traditional hours because of time shifts and so forth. We have very few child care slots for the nontraditional hours. We need to be doing everything we can as people are struggling to hold their families together economically to provide for that quality child care. 
Again, I say to my colleagues, when Senator Hatch and I initially offered the Child Care Development Block Grant Program 10 years ago, we made the point over and over again how important it is to working people that their children are in quality child care. The block grant provides vital assistance to working families as they struggle to meet these needs. But it is not enough; it is sorely underfunded. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that in the wake of welfare reform, there will be a $1.4 billion shortage in assistance for child care. This amendment provides an additional $1 billion for supply and another $500 million to address issues of quality and supply in key areas such as infants and the nontraditional hours. Again, as we move people from welfare to work, it is going to be critically important that we have these quality slots out there for people. So that is the second part of this amendment. 
The additional $140 million is for the Healthy Start Program. Let me just remind my colleagues, I think all of us, I hope, have had an opportunity to visit Healthy Start programs. These programs offer to at-risk mothers prenatal care and other services that have been tremendously successful in seeing to it that new infants and their mothers get the proper care. Again, the studies show how critically important this can be for children's cognitive and emotional development. 
Overall, this effort dedicates an additional, as I said, $14 billion to meeting the most basic needs of our youngest children. Healthy Start, Head Start, and quality child care are all about the earliest days. Obviously, the quality child care can spill over to school years, to after school programs, but nonetheless, the bulk of it goes to the earliest days of these infants' lives to see to it they have the best possible beginning. I realize $14 billion is not an insignificant amount, but over 5 years, that is less than $3 billion a year to fully fund Head Start, to double quality child care, and to provide more resources for Healthy Start. If we can find the $85 billion over 5 years, isn't it possible to find $3 billion less than that a year to make a difference in the lives of children from zero to 5 years? 
So tonight, as we begin this process, this very first amendment that will be voted on in this budget debate, to say we have done a good job here and we can do a bit more. In my view, this agreement must serve the children who we talk about endlessly, who we debate and discuss at every meeting. Here is to reset our priorities for children with just a few more dollars. We know it is going to be hard. We realize there are other problems we are faced with, but when it comes to our children, this Congress, this Senate will stand up and say we can find the resources to see to it that these children get the proper kind of beginning that they deserve. 
But don't look in the faces of innocent children and tell them we can't do a bit more. I know we are going to do a lot for people in the upper income levels, I understand that. If we can do that, we can do this and still balance this budget by asking for a little less in some areas for children, even though they don't vote, don't have political action committees, and don't participate in this process. With all the speeches that are given over and over again, this is the time to let rhetoric become a reality. 
Madam President, at the proper time, obviously, I will ask for a rollcall vote on this amendment and urge my colleagues to join Senator Jeffords and me in this bipartisan proposal. Senator Jeffords is the chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee and has worked on a number of these issues over the years. He has joined with me, as Senator Coats did, on family and medical leave and Senator Hatch on the child care legislation. 
With that, I yield the floor and invite my colleagues' comments.

Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am going to shortly yield the floor as well to my colleague from New Mexico, who is also a cosponsor of the amendment. 
Let me just address the issue of how does this get paid for. We are not allowed specifically here to target revenue sources, but I have tried to lay out in the amendment where the revenues will come from. 
One source is the foreign sales corporation, which most of my colleagues may be familiar with. This was set up back about 1981 or 1982, in fact, part of another budget agreement, done in a conference report. These are basically paper companies with very few employees, if any, in some cases that enabled American companies to exempt export income from U.S. taxation. That is about $24 billion over 5 years. The cigarette tax is another source here. 
I cannot dictate a specific revenue source in this amendment--I am prohibited from specifically directing the Finance Committee. But it would certainly be my intention, as we stated here, to take the $14 billion over 5 years from those sources. If you took a little bit from the foreign sales corporation--you do not have to take all of it--some from the cigarette tax increase, it would be easy to pay for this amendment to provide for full funding for Head Start, child care, and Healthy Start programs. 
My colleague from New Mexico is here, and I yield, Madam President, 5 minutes to my colleague from New Mexico. 
Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.

<DOCNO>105-dodd-ct-16-19970520</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DODD. Briefly, Mr. President, the modification, as I pointed out a moment ago, obviously, under the way the budget agreement is struck here, we cannot dictate to the Finance Committee where revenues--that is up to the committee to decide. I listed various tax cuts that might be modified or increased to pay for the amendment. You have to offset it. I have listed a number at the end of the amendment. I have added the cigarette tax as one that could also be considered, obviously. So that is the modification I sent to the desk. I listed a couple of those already. 
As I said earlier, I think this agreement is a pretty good agreement. I began my remarks in offering the amendment by suggesting that I thought the members of the Budget Committee and others have done a good job, certainly, in this process, and the reason we are debating and voting is we have to offer our own ideas to it. My colleagues may reject the idea or accept the idea. 
I happen to believe that by doing a bit more, a little under $3 billion each year over the next 5 years, in Head Start, in child care, in Early Start, in Healthy Start, is in the best interests of our country. By doing so, by adding a bit more to the cigarette tax or lopping off some of the foreign sales corporation, a program that I think, in fact, we voted on, the billionaire tax cut I listed, 96 Senators voted, 1.6 billion it would bring in. Many times we voted on it. It is there. There are resources that would not in any way get to the issue of middle-income tax cuts that are also included as part of this agreement which I would support.

I respect immensely both my leaders, the chairman and the ranking member of the Budget Committee, and their positions on all of this. I understand their positions. I understand as well that, as Senators, we all have a chance to modify this resolution, hopefully without doing damage to the underlying agreement. 
This resolution is a 5-year commitment to our country. I thought it should also be a stronger 5-year commitment to our children. 
It seems to me that in the midst of everything else going on here, shifting around a little bit to accommodate those needs is very little to ask for America's kids. 
I understand again the leadership position on it. I respect it. I offered the amendment. I am one who supports this agreement, by the way. I am not out here to undo it. I simply want to make it better with this amendment. 
I regret that the leadership will oppose this amendment. But I respect that position, and urge my colleagues to support the amendment when the tabling motion is made.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote for Senate Concurrent Resolution 6--a resolution disapproving the alarming human rights conditions in Afghanistan and highlighting the deleterious effects increased political strife has had on Afghan women and girls. 
Intensification of armed hostilities and the proliferation of human rights abuses have characterized Afghanistan for too long. In both the countryside and in urban areas nearly two decades of civil conflict and chaos have wreaked havoc and disaster on innocent Afghan civilians. And, unfortunately the likelihood of peace for Afghans seems to grow dimmer with each new political development. 
After successfully ousting the Soviet military in 1992, foreign threats to peace were almost immediately replaced by civil threats. Rivalries among political and military Afghan intensified the civil turmoil. Regional conflicts reached a new level of severity in September 1996, after the Taliban coalition seized the capital city of Kabul. 
Upon seizure of Kabul and approximately two-thirds of Afghanistan, the Taliban imposed extreme restrictions on civilians including banning music and books, and specifically prohibiting women and girls from working or attending school. Penalties for those who do not observe the Taliban's strict code of conduct have been extreme ranging from verbal abuse, street beatings, amputations, to death. Western journalists were quick to report the upsurge of human rights abuses, writing about the summary justice used to punish Afghans, and the unusually brutal methods by which the Taliban killed Mr. Najibullah the former President. Amnesty International and other non-governmental organizations reported on the severity of the human rights situation in Afghanistan and urged greater international attention. The United Nations created a special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan to monitor the situation more closely. 
Among all the accounts of human rights abuses in Afghanistan what has been particularly disturbing to me is the treatment of women and girls. Though under the Taliban women are no longer treated as spoils of war, women and girls have been subjected to a series of extreme restrictions including the prohibition to work, attend school, or leave one's home during the day. Without the ability to work, mothers, many widowed due to armed conflict, have no means to support their families. Without the ability to leave their homes to buy food, clothing, attain medical attention, women are unable to care for themselves and their families. Without education, girls are not being taught how to read or write--basic skills necessary for adulthood. The conditions under which Afghan women and girls live is unacceptable, and I can think of no reasonable justification for such circumstances. 
Taliban leaders have been quick to point out in their defense that other political and military factions have committed numerous other human rights abuses. The Taliban is right to point this out. And while it is true that, none of the political factions vying for power in Afghanistan have thus far demonstrated a commitment to uphold international standards of human rights or decency. This does not diminish the gravity of those abuses committed by the Taliban, or the obligation of the international community to speak out against such abuses. 
The need for peace in Afghanistan is clear, but it is equally clear that peace will not be sustainable in an environment where human rights are routinely violated and disregarded. Internationally recognized rights such as freedom from torture, freedom of expression, and equality before the law regardless of race, gender, religion, or beliefs have long been absent in Afghanistan. Any ruling coalition, must know that the international community, and the United States in particular, will not turn a blind eye to a rights-abusive regime. 
Though, we, in the United States, can not singlehandedly solve the crisis in Afghanistan, for that is a process which must take place internally, we can and should do something. As a first step I have offered this resolution--a sense of the Congress which emphasizes the plight of Afghan women and girls, expresses support for the United Nations-led peace negotiations, and recommends that the administration re-evaluate United States policy toward Afghanistan. 
I believe this resolution will send a strong message to the warring factions in Afghanistan that the United States is deeply concerned about the deteriorating human rights conditions. Further I hope this resolution will provide some hope to Afghan women and girls who silently disagree with the Taliban's code of conduct. 
As the United States strongly supports an end to the armed conflict, we should emphasize that peace is not only defined by the absence of armed conflict but also the absence of human rights abuses. It has long been the experience of many other states that only with a rights-protective regime can there be any lasting prospects for peace.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I introduce the Federal Electronic and Information Technology Disability Compliance Act of 1997. In an effort to make it easier for persons with disabilities to work, this legislation will allow the Federal Government to take the lead in providing Federal employees who have disabilities with critical access to technological tools in the workplace. 
The Federal Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Compliance Act of 1997 strengthens Federal requirements that electronic tools and information technology purchased by Federal agencies be made accessible to their employees. Additionally, it would require States that receive Federal resources toward disability programs to meet accessibility guidelines when they purchase technology. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 requires such compliance, but currently there is no enforcement mechanism to assure that this is done. The House of Representatives today passed similar legislation introduced by Representative Anna Eshoo. 
Barriers to information and technology must be broken down. By giving Federal employees with disabilities the opportunity to utilize technological advancements, we provide them hope and encourage self-sufficiency. 
Additionally, I believe these new efforts will encourage the private sector to adopt similar procedures. Let the Federal Government provide a good example to the private sector in its efforts. 
Concrete examples of technological advancements that have aided persons with disabilities include: Telephones and fax machines with voice features for the visually impaired; voice mail that is converted for the deaf or hearing impaired; and CD-ROM or network-based information systems that can be equipped with audio descriptions of visual elements. 
Nationally, there are 49 million Americans who have disabilities. It is critical, Mr. President, that given the rapid introduction of new technologies, persons with disabilities not be allowed to fall behind. The more we can do to promote their equality, independence, and dignity, the better. 
I want to commend Mr. William Paul of United Technologies Corp., in my state of Connecticut, for first bringing this matter to my attention. Mr. Paul has identified a critical need among members of our society. His civic-minded actions deserve to be commended not only by people with disabilities, but by all Americans. 
Mr. President, I believe this a modest measure, that will improve the lives of the millions of Americans who have disabilities across this country and benefit our society as a whole. I hope to have my colleagues support.

Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Texas, and my Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for yielding some time. 
Mr. President, I have some brief remarks, and I begin by commending the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for offering what I think is a very thoughtful and reasonable substitute proposal before the Senate. I want to associate my remarks with those of my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, who spoke a few moments ago about the difficult decision that Congresses over the last quarter of a century have grappled with since the adoption of Roe versus Wade by the Supreme Court of the United States. It is never an easy issue. 
Mr. President, let me also state at the outset that I have deep respect for those who have differing views on this issue. By and large, people in this body have held out a great deal of respect for those with opposing views on this issue. It is not easy. There are those who take the position except where the life of the mother is involved, abortion ought to be banned. I respect that view. I disagree with it. There are those who take the view 
that abortion ought to be allowed under any circumstance during pregnancy. I respect that view. I disagree with it. 
What Senator Daschle has offered here today, I think, is a reasonable approach to dealing with the issue of postviability abortion. It does so by addressing concerns that have been raised over the years, putting aside the particular procedure which is the subject, of course, of the proposal being offered by our colleague from Pennsylvania. That is, it tries to limit and define the circumstances under which a fetus would be aborted in the postviability period. 
I say with all due respect, obviously with the exception of one of our colleagues, none of us are physicians. We are Senators. We are public figures. I have a great deal of hesitancy, Mr. President, to engage in debate and discussion on the floor of the U.S. Senate and to try to take on responsibilities where we lack expertise. 
What the proposal of our colleague from Pennsylvania suggests is that we ban a particular procedure. I respect that but I do not feel in any way adequately prepared to be engaged in deciding whether or not certain medical procedures are adequate or inadequate. I note that the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, on behalf of some 38,000 physicians, has endorsed the Daschle proposal. I do not suggest that everyone has. I suspect there are those who disagree within the medical profession about abortion, just as physicians disagree about other medical issues, and just as there are those who are not physicians who have disagreements. 
But I believe that Senator Snowe and Senator Daschle, as I said, have offered a carefully crafted measure that will actually reduce the number of abortions performed in this country in the postviability period. I share the hope expressed by my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, a few moments ago. It appears there will not be enough votes to support the Daschle amendment. I hope that is not the case, but it may be such. I also hope that we will come to the point where this reasonable proposal becomes the position of the majority, if not unanimously, of Members of this body. There are those who have disagreed on this issue and will continue to do so, but if we can find common ground on this particular proposal where we would deal with the issue in a broader context than the issue of approaching this situation procedure by procedure by procedure by procedure, sitting here as a body trying to determine whether each and every one of those procedures is medically sound or proper or right. 
The procedure of abortion itself, no matter how it is performed, can be described, of course, in the most brutal terms, and all of us understand that. It does not mean, necessarily, that you are going to ban all the procedures at any time except, of course, if you subscribe to the notion that abortion ought to be banned from conception. 
So this proposal here, I think, does offer people of different views on this issue a chance to come together to do something in a positive and constructive way and deal with this issue in a much more generic way than the effort to do so on a procedure-by-procedure basis--an effort, by the way, that would not stop a single abortion. 
Mr. President, regarding the issue of the health of the mother, when a woman and her fetus are both healthy and the fetus is able to survive outside the womb, we should not and do not permit abortion. Roe versus Wade and subsequent decisions do not permit abortion in these circumstances. The Senator from South Dakota's legislation does not permit abortion--by any method--in these circumstances. But, we also recognize that a woman's life and physical health, when either is seriously threatened, should be protected. 
Tragically, that is sometimes the case when a woman is in the later stages of pregnancy. Thankfully, such instances are rare. 
But they do occur. And when they do, abortion is sometimes the only way to save the woman's life or preserve her health from grievous, lasting, physical damage. I cannot turn my back on women who, along with their husbands, desperately want the children with whom their are pregnant and then tragically find themselves with their physical health at grievous risk. Such cases should be excepted under a ban on post-viability abortions, and that is what the Daschle proposal does. 
Some argue, Mr. President, that there are never health circumstances that would require partial-birth abortion. Others say that post-viability abortions are never necessary. Viable babies, they argue, can just be delivered. Mr. President, in those cases where the mother faces a serious health risk and a viable baby can still be delivered alive, it is. But sadly, that is not always the case. As the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has explained, after viability, `terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances to save the life or preserve the health of the mother.' 
The Senator from South Dakota, along with the Senator from Maine, worked very, very hard to craft language here that would ban post-viability abortions except to deal with life endangerment or grievous, serious, physical conditions. That is an effort reached through serious consultation. I think all of our colleagues here, as the Senator from Tennessee indicated earlier, have deep appreciation for the time and effort that the Democratic leader has put into this effort. This was not legislation or wording crafted by staff here trying to come up with some words that would make all of us feel comfortable. Rather, the Senator from South Dakota went about the business of asking people all across this country who are knowledgeable to define language which they could support and could relate to. The fact that the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports this language, I think, is a good indication that they feel comfortable that this would do what the Senator wants to do. They do not necessarily agree with what he wants to do, but they believe they can function as medical professionals and define clearly what must be done. 
The fact there is a certification process here is important. The suggestion that this certification is somehow going to allow for widespread violation of the ban is, I think, mistaken. As the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, my colleague, pointed out, a certification process which would place in jeopardy the medical license of a physician has to be taken very, very seriously. I cannot believe that the overwhelming majority of doctors in this country, when considering whether or not circumstances existed which would warrant having a postviability abortion, would not want to know very, very carefully whether or not those circumstances were being met as dictated by the substitute of the Senator from South Dakota. I don't think any doctor would violate this ban when doing so would mean loss of his or her very livelihood. 
I believe this is a real solution. I believe it would make a difference. I believe it would give this body an opportunity to really speak in a far broader and meaningful way on this issue that I think the Nation would applaud. There will be some who obviously disagree with this because they think it does not go far enough, others who think this goes way too far. But from my point of view, Mr. President, I think this strikes the reasonable balance and reflects where most people are on this issue. None feel terribly comfortable with this. I know of very few who enjoy any sense of comfort in discussing, or considering even, this issue. 
So, today, we are given an opportunity to do something meaningful on this, not on a procedure-by-procedure basis, but to deal fundamentally with the issue of what and how a woman, her doctor and her family can act under the most serious and troublesome circumstances. I applaud the Senator from South Dakota for this effort. I support this effort. I hope my colleagues will do so, as well.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the past success of the CFE Treaty and to stress that, in order to continue that success, this body must now offer its advice and consent for the CFE Treaty's Flank Document. 
Since the CFE Treaty entered into force in 1992 it has made Europe a safer place; not just because it has resulted in the removal or destruction of over 53,000 items of major military equipment; not just because it has enabled international inspectors to undertake nearly 3,000 on-site international inspections; but, above all, because it has fostered a sense of trust between NATO and Russia. 
Now, as we move to build on that sense of trust and deal with Russia as a new democratic state rather than an old arch-enemy, it is only fair and proper that we address Russia's concerns with respect to some of the arcane provisions of this treaty. The CFE Treaty, as written, establishes zones on an old cold war map, a map drawn before the breakup of the former Soviet Union. The pending revised Flank Document updates alters some of the provisions of this treaty to reflect the fact that we're now dealing with a new map. 
Clearly the Flank Document does not address all the issues that we must face in adapting the CFE Treaty to the new situation in Europe, but it is a fine first step. 
The conditions in the resolution of ratification are, for the most part, thoughtful and necessary. I also support the amendment, offered by Senators Kerry and Sarbanes, clarifying condition 5 as it relates to Armenia. 
Without this amendment, section F of condition No. 5 would have required the President to submit a special report to Congress regarding whether or not Armenia has been in compliance with the CFE Treaty, and, if not, what actions the President has taken to implement sanctions. 
Why should we single out Armenia? Without the amendment, the language assumed that Armenia and only Armenia violated the CFE Treaty and should suffer sanctions. 
This amendment was added in the interest of fairness and simply asks the President to examine compliance of all States Parties located in the Caucasus region rather than singling out Armenia for special treatment. 
While the amendment ameliorates one problem with the resolution of ratification, I have another misgiving about another condition that was adopted by the Committee on Foreign Relations during consideration of the treaty last week. Condition No. 9 would require the President to certify that he will submit to the Senate, for its advice and consent, the agreement to multilateralize the 1971 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. 
I am of the same mind as my distinguished colleague, Senator Biden, on this issue. While the Senate does not prohibit itself from attaching unrelated conditions to resolutions of ratification, the Senate should exercise some self-restraint in such important matters. The Founding Fathers clearly distinguished the question of treaty ratification by requiring a supermajority in such cases. This is not every day legislation we're dealing with here. We're debating whether or not to ratify a treaty, and this attached, unrelated condition really has no place in today's debate. 
In short, condition No. 9 links ratification of the Flank Document with the unrelated, but controversial 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty debate. There are merits to both sides of that issue and that debate will surely have its time. This is the wrong way to move that debate forward. 
Let us be certain of one thing: The Senate, with condition 9, interferes with what has long been a function of the executive branch. In the breakups of the U.S.S.R., Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Ethiopia, when the new States took on the treaty rights and obligations of their predecessors, no request for Senate advice and consent was sought. I ask my colleagues: Why are we treating the ABM Treaty differently? 
In spite of my objection to condition 9, this treaty and its resolution of ratification are too important to be bogged down today over a debate on the ABM Treaty. I believe that the appropriate course of action is to ratify the pending Flank Document this is a reasonable initial adjustment to the CFE Treaty. In doing so, we will also show Russia that we are willing to work with Russian officials in facing legitimate concerns, and, most importantly, we will maintain the viability of this valuable 30-nation agreement.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with a simple message, a message to the Government of China to release Wei Jingsheng. Who is Wei Jingsheng? Born in China, Wei Jingsheng is a dreamer, a political activist, a writer, a silenced leader, an inspiration, a nurturing older brother, and one who possesses an unparalleled faith in democracy and its place in modern China. He is the kind of man who if living in America would undoubtedly grace these Halls. But Wei Jingsheng does not live in the United States, he lives in China, where the courage of his convictions have not been appreciated, in fact quite the opposite, Wei Jingsheng has been severely punished. 
In speaking out for democracy and reform, Wei Jingsheng has suffered great consequences--consequences including nearly 18 years of solitary confinement, torturous treatment, the lack of medical attention, and numerous other methods known to squelch a man's spirits and weaken his convictions. 
Now that we know about his punishment, let us consider Wei Jingsheng's crimes: numerous writings on democracy, a series of letters to China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping before his death, communicating with foreign journalists, participating in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement, and most recently meeting with John Shattuck, the United States Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor in 1994. Frankly, these do not strike me as crimes, or actions that warrant any sanctions by the state, and most certainly are not at all commensurate with the punishment Wei Jingsheng has endured. 
Respect for human rights is an international concept. We only need look to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to see a sample of the international consensus on human rights. While China may resent United States scrutiny on this topic, we do in fact have a legitimate right, as well as a moral obligation, to call for improved conditions. We can and should have a human rights dialog with Chinese leaders, and I encourage the administration to make more opportunities for such high level discussions to take place. 
Wei Jingsheng is reported to be near the end of his life--a life of struggle and hardship. His recently published book `The Courage To Stand Alone: Letters From Prison and Other Writings' underscore Wei Jingsheng's struggle to promote democracy in China. I stand with my other colleagues in the Senate today to encourage the Government of China to immediately release Wei Jingsheng.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the legislation before us today to reauthorize the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. It is a strong, balanced bill. One that I am a proud cosponsor of and one that I believe we should all be proud to support. 
Getting to this point has not been easy and I would like to thank our majority leader, Senator Lott, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, Senator Harkin, and others for all of the time they have invested in putting together this strong and balanced bill and for assigning it such a high priority for consideration by the full Senate. 
There has been a great deal of debate about this bill in the last several years. But one thing is very clear. In its over 20 years, IDEA has made an incredible difference to millions of American children, their families, and society as a whole. 
Before the passage of this landmark legislation, children with disabilities were frequently excluded from schools, and some had absolutely no opportunity for education at all. Expectations for these children were low. Not only was great potential undervalued and lost, but also we lost as taxpayers who often picked up the tab for a lifetime of support. State and communities were struggling with increasing litigation and state court rulings requiring them to serve all children in the schools. 
IDEA brought us all together--the Federal Government, States, local communities, schools, parents and students--behind a firm commitment, a promise to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities. 
Since that time, we have made huge improvements in affording children with disabilities the same opportunities open to other students. Today, more than half of all students with disabilities go onto college and 57 percent of youth with disabilities are competitively employed within 5 years of leaving school. 
These students go on to good jobs in every sector of our economy. Not only are they workers, they are taxpayers. 
But the impact of IDEA is broader; it works for all students. Nondisabled students live, work, and learn alongside all the members of their community. Those are skills that over the long run make our whole society stronger. 
Unfortunately, over the last several years, concerns have been raised about IDEA--concerns about cost of services, discipline, the low Federal contribution, litigation and inclusion. There is no question, it has been a difficult few years. But we have something to show for all the debates and questions: this bill. 
One thing has not changed in this bill--children with disabilities remain at its core. 
But in this reauthorization, we have improved IDEA to ensure that the law does not stand in the way of meeting children's needs. 
Administrative requirements are clarified and streamlined. Discipline procedures, which have been the focus of so much attention, are modified to provided school officials with additional tools to ensure the safety of all children. Mediation systems to resolve disputes about the placements of children are required in each State. We also clarified that attorney's fees are not allowed during the development of the Individual Education Plan or in pre-complaint mediation. In addition, parents must provide school districts with more detailed information on their concerns to avoid protracted legal battles. 
This bill also better defines the role of other partners in the effort to meet these special needs. Regular classroom teachers are clearly defined as part of the students' IEP team. The parents' role is strengthened or clarified. In addition, states have new authority to collect from noneducational agencies for noneducational services, such as speech therapy. The IDEA bill before us also provides new enforcement tools for the Department of Education to ensure that this law is properly implemented and enforced. 
Beyond the larger issues, there were several issues of deep importance to me that I am pleased to see in this final bill. Language is included reaffirming the importance of braille instruction to students with visual impairments. The bill also reauthorizes a program providing support for an unique and wonderful effort, the National Theater of the Deaf. The Theater, which is based in Chester, CT, has traveled across the country and world inspiring and entertaining hearing and nonhearing audiences. 
Mr. President, fundamentally, this is a good bill--a strong bill that will guarantee us the full potential of all of our children. I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in strong support of this effort.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise here this morning to comment on a piece of legislation that my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, and I introduced actually a few days ago, but because of the pressing nature of the business on the floor of the Senate, did not get a chance to actually discuss it here. 
I would like to describe what we have introduced and urge our colleagues to join us in this effort and urge the administration to join us as well. 
The legislation we introduced is called the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. It is a piece of legislation that we think has great value. 
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only one-fifth, or 20 percent, of all drugs on the market in the United States have been tested for their safety and effectiveness in children. Children are not simply smaller versions of adults. Their bodies actually metabolize drugs quite differently as they grow older. 
The lack of information about how drugs work in children can place pediatricians in an untenable position. They can either prescribe powerful drugs for their young patients that have only been tested in adults or they can deny them access to life-saving therapies. 
This dilemma is dramatically illustrated in the case of children with AIDS. The hopes of tens of thousands of adult AIDS patients were raised last year by the promising benefits of protease inhibiters. However, the families of very young children have much less to be hopeful about. 
None of these drugs is yet approved for newborns and infants. This is despite the fact that the earliest days of a child's life may be the most promising time to reverse the effects of HIV. As unbelievable as it may seem, physicians are forced to treat these children without the benefit and guidance of research. 
Even in adults, getting the proper dosage of these powerful drugs is tricky indeed. Too large a dose can cause severe side effects; too small a dose can make the HIV virus mutate into a far more dangerous, drug-resistant strain. In children, the effects are compounded. A full-strength dose can kill a toddler. 
Other examples of this problem, Mr. President, are also quite disturbing. Despite the fact that asthma is one of the most common chronic illnesses in children, and the most common cause of children's admissions to hospitals all across this country, there is only one asthma drug that has been tested for children under 5 years of age. 
In fact, my colleague from Ohio personally and eloquently related a situation with one of his own children who has asthma that I am sure he will comment on at some appropriate time. 
It is alarming that with asthma we have the single most common reason for admission to the hospital for children and yet we have no drugs tested to treat children under the age of 5. 
As other examples, despite the fact that sedatives are used to help treat sick and injured children, not a single sedative has been specifically tested for safety and efficacy in children under the age of 2. In addition, virtually every medication currently used to treat stomach and intestinal diseases in children has only been tested in adults. 
While this so-called off label prescribing is neither illegal or improper, it forces doctors to practice hand-me-down medicine for pediatric cases, which is unacceptable, to put it mildly. 
I think it is about time, Mr. President, we took the guesswork out of children's medicine. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children's Act is a simple solution to this problem. It provides a fair and reasonable market incentive for drug companies to make the extra effort needed to test their products for use by children. It grants an additional 6 months of market exclusivity for drugs which have undergone pediatric studies at the request of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
I want to briefly point to something most parents are all too familiar with--the disclaimers that appear on the labels of so many of the pharmaceutical products that are needed and used by children: `Not recommended for use in children, as no clinical studies have been performed to determine risks, benefits, and dosages.' Another says, `Safety and effectiveness in children younger than the age of 2 has not been established.' Or, `Safety and effectiveness in children younger than age 12 have not been established.' And, `Safety and efficacy in children younger than age 18 have not been established.' 
We have labels on the food that children eat; we have labels now for the programs that children watch on television. I think we would all agree that it is about time we have labels that parents and physicians can rely on when they give children medicine. 
The bill that Senator DeWine and I have introduced is a sensible way to keep our children healthier. That is why it has enjoyed broad bipartisan support both in and outside of the Congress. 
In fact, the bill is endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, and PHRMA, the trade association of the pharmaceutical industry. Senators Mikulski and Kennedy have signed on as cosponsors, and I know that Representative Greenwood will soon be introducing this bill in the other body. 
Mr. President, this is commonsense legislation. I call on our colleagues to join Senator DeWine and myself in this effort. We hope we can get passage quickly. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. DODD. I join together with my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, in recognizing the birthday of an individual with whom we are all familiar. Our constituent in Connecticut, Katharine Hepburn, will turn 90 on Monday. She probably will not be happy to have her Senator reveal her age on television. 
Katharine Hepburn is a national treasure. We take pride in the fact that she is a native of Connecticut, of Hartford, and today lives in Old Saybrook. She is world renown and has made a great contribution to the arts. At the Bushnell Memorial in Hartford, where there is a `wall of fame,' she scribbled next to her name, `Local girl.' We cannot say that about everyone on that wall. She has a career spanning seven decades and is the only person in the history of film in this country who has received 12 Academy Award nominations. She won four awards, for `Morning Glory' in 1933, `Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,' `Lion in Winter,' and `On Golden Pond.' 
She won three Oscars after she turned age 60. For people in this country who wonder whether you can have a productive life after the age of 60, certainly Katharine Hepburn offers vivid proof that productive years lie ahead. 
On behalf of all of us in Connecticut, Mr. President, and my colleagues here, we wish Miss Hepburn a very, very happy birthday.

Mr. DODD. Ironically, in the same town of Old Saybrook, CT, we have a sadder piece of news about a wonderful constituent of my State.

She was well into her nineties at the time of her death and was truly a remarkable person.

Mr. DODD. Ann Petry's father was a pharmacist who opened up a pharmacy in 1902 in Old Saybrook, CT. Although she learned the pharmacy trade from her father, her contribution, of course, was in literature. 
Her famous novel, `The Street,' written in the 1940's, was a remarkable piece of journalism that is still read today by younger generations. She followed that novel with two others that received wide recognition, `The Narrows,' and `A Country Place,' about a Connecticut town that many thought could be Old Saybrook. She wrote a number of short stories and articles. Ann Petry was truly a very remarkable person. 
She did not have much use for fools and academicians, she once said, and she said she was usually speaking about one and the same person when talking of fools and academicians. I do not know that I agree, but she was a person of curt opinion, straightforward talk, and was well admired and loved in the town of Old Saybrook. Her contributions to literature have brightened the lives of many, many people. 
We express our sorrow for the loss of Ann Petry.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, I may not even take the 2 minutes. I just wanted to inform my colleagues that about a week ago, Congressman Chris Shays, of Connecticut, and I hosted a program called Debtbusters with a group of 200 of our constituents. We invited people to come together to sit down in groups and try to balance the Federal budget in 5 years. This is an exercise designed by the Concord Coalition, and it is the first time such an event has been done on a bipartisan basis. I highly recommend it to my colleagues. 
It is a fascinating exercise to watch people act as Members of Congress over a period of 2 or 3 hours, faced with the choices that many of us have to make here in Washington as we work toward a balanced budget by the year 2002. It was a tremendously worthwhile exercise. I want to commend the Concord Coalition for organizing it, for putting together the questionnaire. It was not perfect. Anyone who writes questions and makes choices obviously is going to bring some bias to it. But overall I found it to be rather fair and interesting. I would also like to commend the citizens of Connecticut, specifically the citizens of Stamford and the surrounding area, for taking the time out of their weekends to come together and work in such a constructive spirit. 
It was curious to see the choices that people made. People, when they sat down and had to work with six or seven or eight other people from their community with many different ideas and issues, were able to compromise and come to conclusions and even give up on things they cared about very, very much. It was instructive. It did not solve the budget problem. But last Saturday I was impressed that, on a gloriously sunny day, people came out and spent the 2 or 3 hours to try and resolve these issues. I thought my colleagues might find it interesting. 
As we are about to hopefully reach some sort of budget agreement ourselves, I believe it is worthwhile to appreciate what average citizens are able to do, just as I said, in a few hours on a bright sunny Saturday morning. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont for making the time available and I yield back any time I have.

Mr. DODD. As a former Peace Corps volunteer and someone who was a Big Brother and served on the national board of Big Brothers, I commend the effort to focus attention on this. I would like to make note of the fact, with the Philadelphia Conference going on, we are 6 months almost to the day since election day and still there is a chair vacant around the Cabinet table, that of the Secretary of Labor. This is a critically important issue to millions of people, a substantive issue that must be addressed immediately. My hope is that the leadership would see to it this week that we would vote. Vote against Alexis Herman if people wish but give her the opportunity to be confirmed or not confirmed and give us a chair at that Cabinet table for the millions of people who do not have a voice at the table representing management and labor. So I urge that the leadership move on this issue. We brought up this issue. I understand that. But the issue of the nomination of the Secretary of Labor 6 months after the election is long overdue. 
I thank my colleague for yielding.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, Maj. Michael Donnelly of Connecticut flew 44 missions for the Air Force during the Persian Gulf war. He is now afflicted with a neuro-muscular disorder he suspects was caused by chemical exposure in the war. I had the pleasure of meeting with Major Donnelly last week after he testified before the Human Resources Subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. His testimony provided a special insight into the plight of some Persian Gulf war veterans who fell ill after returning home.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York. Let me begin these brief remarks by commending our colleague, the chairman of the Banking and Housing Committee, Senator D'Amato, for pushing this as effectively and expeditiously as he has. We know it is hard to get on the agenda here with all the other matters we have to consider. The fact that we are considering this legislation as quickly as we are is a credit to him and also to the leadership of the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. It is noncontroversial because all of our colleagues, I think, recognize what is being done to senior citizens. 
Senator D'Amato has rightfully pointed out the tremendous work done by Richard Bryan, our colleague from Nevada, who has been deeply involved in this issue. Also, Andrew Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and his staff have done an excellent job on this issue. He has worked hard to prevent scam artists from taking advantage of elderly Americans in these reverse mortgage opportunities. So many people can rightfully sit at the table and take credit for where we are today--about to pass critical legislation that will help our senior citizens. 
Mr. President, everyone in this country needs a safe and secure place to live; that is a dream as old as the Republic. In recent years, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has developed a number of innovative programs that are helping many more Americans achieve the dream of home ownership. The National Home Ownership Strategy, a public-private partnership of 62 organizations, has helped to increase home ownership to a rate of 65.6 percent, Mr. President. That is the highest rate in 15 years. As an aside, I am very hopeful that we will continue to work on creative ideas, under the leadership of the chairman of the committee, and others, to increase home ownership in more of our disadvantaged areas. We have subsidized rents for years, and there has been real value in that, in providing decent shelter for people. I would like to see us do more to subsidize equity and ownership. Nothing does more to clean up a street or a neighborhood than people who have an equity interest or financial interest in what happens to the buildings on their block. 
I know the chairman and others have expressed a strong interest in this. So maybe we can move even further than we already have, and increase home ownership rates even higher. 
The bill we are considering today will help protect homeowners. It will protect senior citizens who have worked hard, struggled to save, and built decent homes for their families. Our senior citizens fought very hard to get their homes. These are people who didn't have the advantages of a lot of new opportunities that banks provide, and that HUD has provided, to get out and make those downpayments on that first home. These are our retired citizens now, who have fought to keep their homes, who held two, three, four jobs to do so, and paid off those mortgages. They are sitting there holding their home free and clear of any debt. And now, as a result of that, financial institutions very creatively are offering the reverse mortgage, which the chairman has talked about, and are saying you can borrow against that equity in order to take care of medical bills, groceries, or heating bills you may have, and other things that come up. It is a very creative idea to be able to reverse a mortgage, in effect, for things that people need. 
But what happens, of course, when something like this comes along, there are always the thugs who try to take advantage of people. This is nothing new. They are always out there. They run around and go door to door, literally, Mr. President, where these elderly people live and rip them off, as the chairman pointed out passionately this morning. These are people who have worked hard and done everything right and live alone, in some cases, and their family may be removed and they don't get the kind of advice they should be getting. You can say `caveat emptor, buyer beware; you ought to do a better job.' But it is difficult. They are frightened and scared, and some fast-talking salesman comes in with a quick deal and they don't know the difference. 
As a result of the chairman's efforts this morning and the unanimous support that I think we are going to have from all of our colleagues here, we are going to slam the door on these scam artists--loan sharks is really what they are. That is simple terminology that most people can understand. 
So I am very pleased, Mr. President, to join my colleague from New York, and others, this morning in urging the adoption of this legislation and urging the House, which I hope will move quickly on this, so that we can submit this bill to the President for signature. I know the President strongly supports our efforts here as well. 
This is a good example of a Congress working together to take care of a problem that exists in the country. This legislation will provide our elderly citizens, our seniors, with the security of knowing that the reverse mortgage, which they are taking out for their needs, will not cost them more than it should. So I am delighted to be a cosponsor of this. I commend the chairman again, and others, for their work. I thank the Housing and Urban Development Agency, under the leadership of Andrew Cuomo, for being so supportive. I look forward to the passage of this bill, Mr. President. 
I thank my colleague and I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Vermont for his generosity in yielding time. 
Mr. President, yesterday I included some extensive remarks in the Record regarding the overall treaty. I let those remarks speak for themselves today. 
First, I begin by commending our colleagues, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms; the ranking Democrat on the committee, Senator Biden; the majority leader, Senator Lott; and the minority leader, Senator Daschle, for working out the arrangements of this treaty so we can come up for a vote prior to the April 29 deadline. 
Let me also say, Mr. President, while there are disagreements--and there will be over the ultimate decision of whether or not to support the treaty--I think the debate and the process we have gone through has been healthy. I suspect those who are deeply involved in the workings of this treaty have improved it. So I commend all of our colleagues for the work they have done on this particular effort. I think it is how the Senate of the United States ought to conduct its business when it comes to matters dealing with obligations to commit our country for many years to come. It was no mistake that our Founding Fathers required supermajorities to commit this Nation to international arrangements, and the fact that we require supermajorities for treaties, I think, is worthwhile. 
Mr. President, I want to focus my attention, if I can, on the first amendment that will be raised here. The amendment will strike a condition in the treaty that has been included by Senator Helms. I am going to oppose condition 30, which I believe will be the first vote we will cast. This is the rogue states condition. I will explain what that means and express why I think it ought to be struck from this treaty in the brief time I have available to me. 
Mr. President, we must ask only one question today. We must ask: Is this treaty in the best interests of our country? That is our obligation as Members of the U.S. Senate. That is the question which we must address. This condition 30, the rogue states condition, I think, is not in the best interests of the United States. I think it would prohibit the United States from ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention. It would prohibit us, of course, from ratifying the convention until nations such as North Korea, Libya, Syria and Iraq ratify the treaty. 
More than any of the other conditions we will vote on, Mr. President, later today, this condition would delay indefinitely, in my view, the ratification of this treaty. The so-called rogue states condition would force the United States of America to wait until all of the pariah states of the world ratify before we, ourselves, would accept the treaty that we, ourselves negotiated. 
There is a reason, Mr. President, that we use the words rogue and pariah to describe these countries such as North Korea, Libya, Iran. These are the nations that are the loners in the international arena and who routinely disregard international opinion in pursuing their own interests. These rogue nations, these renegade nations, have never given weight to world opinion. There is no reason to expect that they will have a change of heart any time soon. Waiting for these rogue states to accept this treaty is literally like waiting for Godot. 
Let it be known, then, that a vote against striking this condition is, in my view, without any question whatever, a vote to prohibit U.S. participation in the Chemical Weapons Convention. If we include, Mr. President, this condition 30, the rogue states condition, we might as well include a condition that requires ratification by every single nation on Earth before we ratify, for these are, indeed, the very last nations that would ever accept this treaty. That is because these nations, these rogue nations, fear this treaty and the international determination that it demonstrates. 
Our country, Mr. President, has decided unilaterally to destroy its aging chemical weapons stockpile by the year 2004. That is a decision we have already made. Regardless of what other nations do, we have decided to take ourselves out of the chemical weapons business unilaterally, and yet the assumption under this faulty condition is that we must not disarm until other nations with chemical weapons or chemical weapons capability disarm as well. 
We must be clear, Mr. President, that having agreed, ourselves, to destroy our chemical weapons, this treaty deals with whether or not we can act with the backing of the world to bring other nations to do the same. As Secretary Albright has said very simply, `This treaty is about other nations' chemical weapons, not our own.' We will destroy, Mr. President, our weapons because they are no longer needed. So this idea that we must wait for other nations to ratify this treaty, I believe, is fatally flawed. 
This convention would establish an international norm that will allow us to pressure rogue states who decide they would rather keep and enhance their chemical weapons stockpile. On the basis of what we now know about the Persian Gulf war, that many thousands of this Nation's troops may have been exposed to chemical agents, we must not pass up the chance, in my view, to establish a norm that would have made it far more difficult for Iraq to have the weapons in the first place. Remember, Mr. President, there is no law that bars a nation from building, stockpiling, upgrading, or transferring their chemical weapons. In fact, when Iraq used chemical weapons against the Kurds, as heinous an act as it was, the Iraqis did not even violate the Geneva Protocol because they did not use the agents in an international conflict. 
What we need today, Mr. President, is a new agreement. This convention goes much farther in establishing a basis for international action against chemical weapons themselves. 
I further object, Mr. President, to this rogue states condition because we should not allow our foreign policy decisions to be dictated by rogue states--by a Libya, a North Korea, and an Iraq. Let us remember that the negotiating teams of President Reagan and President Bush anticipated the likelihood that rogue nations would not accept this treaty. That is why President Reagan's and President Bush's teams included sanctions, when they wrote this treaty, against nations that remained outside of this treaty. This condition 30, the rogue states condition, insults those negotiating teams that worked so hard and with such great foresight on this very treaty. It assumes that they were so shortsighted that they did not anticipate that rogue nations would oppose it. That is not the case. The truth, again, is that the negotiators knew very well that these rogue nations would look upon this treaty as something that they would have to oppose, so we and other nations demanded that these renegade nations be penalized. 
How ironic it is, Mr. President, that unless the United States strikes 
this rogue states condition, we now will be penalized ourselves. Germany, I point out, has already indicated its intent to impose the sanctions against nonparticipants that this treaty mandates. 
Let us be aware, Mr. President, we live in a new world. Scholars use the words `multipolar' and `post-nationalist' to describe today's world. Other nations are increasingly capable of taking action without our leadership, regretfully I might add. Those who think this treaty will not go into effect without our ratification are thinking of an older world, of the days when the United States declined to participate in the League of Nations and it failed as a result. Mr. President, that was over three-quarters of a century ago. Let me assure my colleagues that to the extent we isolate ourselves today, our country will pay a price tomorrow. 
The question before us this hour with this condition that will come up shortly, is, will we allow a group of rogue, renegade nations to disengage the United States from the international community on this issue of chemical weapons? 
Mr. President, when this Nation allows itself to be held back by the shortsightedness, the evil of other nations, we make a huge mistake indeed. President Reagan did not wait for other nations when he took the first step forward on the matter of chemical weapons by declaring that the United States would unilaterally destroy its chemical weapons stockpile. President Reagan did not wait for other nations when he initiated negotiations to ban chemical weapons from this Earth. President Bush did not wait for other nations to sign this treaty. Presidents Reagan and Bush did not follow others in making those critical decisions. We led, as great nations must, and others have fallen in behind us. Our Nation set the example. Now it is time for us to set the example once again. 
Finally, Mr. President, we must keep in mind that opponents of this treaty argue both sides of the issue. On the one hand, they argue that rogue states will reap great benefits from the technology and intelligence available to them as participants in this treaty. 
That argument assumes that these nations can't wait to participate in this treaty. Yet, on the other hand, this condition that we will vote on assumes that rogue states will avoid participating in this treaty. 
If parties to this treaty pick up such a technological advantage, why aren't these rogue nations crawling over themselves to ratify the treaty? They should be the first in line if that is the case. Why then do we need this condition? 
The truth is, Mr. President, that rogue nations fear this convention and this treaty. Waiting for them to ratify is absurd. No one expects them to ratify, so we should at least become a party to a treaty that will severely restrict the flow of chemicals to those nations, rather than assisting them by a reluctance to move forward. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment to strike, and I urge the adoption of the treaty itself. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for U.S. ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
First, I wish to thank Senators Biden and Lugar for their untiring efforts in seeking ratification of this historic treaty. I also want to commend the majority leader for working diligently with both sides to bring this treaty to the Senate floor for consideration. No matter where one stands on this issue, we all agree that it is proper for this debate to take place while our Nation can still become a full participant in the convention. 
I think that it is only appropriate that we are having this debate 1 week after we commemorated the second anniversary of the bombing of the Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City. That singular event made us all aware that we are vulnerable to terrorism on our own soil. We also remember when terrorists launched a chemical attack in Tokyo's subways, taking 12 lives and injuring thousands more. We must take action to protect Americans from a similar terrorist outrage, and therefore it is incumbent upon this body to approve the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention is also relevant today in light of recent findings that thousands of our troops may have been exposed to chemical weapons during the Persian Gulf war. Veterans groups across the country have called on the Senate to approve the CWC, and I believe that it is inexcusable for us to forgo this opportunity to take a stand against chemical warfare. If we fail to do so, we will be unnecessarily placing those who volunteer their services in our military at risk. 
It is impossible to overstate the importance of the votes that will be cast in this Chamber tomorrow. We have an opportunity to consider a proposal that would eliminate an entire class of weapons of mass destruction, and we may never have this opportunity again. Our decisions will have a tremendous impact on the safety of the American people and our Nation's role as an international leader. 
We are all familiar with the horrifying effects associated with chemical weapons. We remember the use of mustard gas in World War I and the use of chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war. It was the inhumane nature of chemical warfare that prompted President Reagan to initiate the negotiations for an international treaty to eliminate the use of chemical weapons. President Bush was also committed to phasing out chemical weapons, and the United States joined 160 other nations in signing the Chemical Weapons Convention during the final days of his administration. 
President Clinton has been a strong supporter of the convention, and he has made ratification of this treaty his top foreign policy priority. 
For nearly a decade, the United States led efforts to develop the Chemical Weapons Convention, and the result was an effective agreement to eliminate chemical weapons that was unprecedented in its scope. Considering its history of bipartisan support, one would have expected this treaty to be easily approved by the Senate. Unfortunately, opponents of the convention have distorted the facts surrounding this treaty, and it is possible that the United States will fail to ratify the treaty that it initiated. 
I strongly believe that the Chemical Weapons Convention is an effective tool for combating chemical warfare, and I hope that my fellow Senators will look beyond the rhetoric of the treaty's detractors and look at the positive things that this measure would accomplish. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the development or transfer of chemical weapons by member nations. It also requires participating states to destroy their chemical weapon stockpiles and chemical weapons production facilities under the observation of international inspectors. 
The convention would also establish the most extensive verification regime of any arms control treaty, that would require inspections of not only governmental facilities but also civilian facilities. This system of monitoring will provide us with a mechanism for knowing who produces what chemicals throughout the world, and where these chemicals are being sent. 
The convention also prohibits signatory nations from exporting chemicals most frequently used in chemical weapons to non-member countries. The import of some chemicals from non-member nations would also be prohibited. These measures should isolate nonmember nations and provide them with incentive to ratify the convention. 
In order to oversee the convention's implementation, the CWC establishes the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or the OPCW. This organization will monitor the chemical production throughout the world and will enforce compliance with the convention. 
On April 29, the Chemical Weapons Convention will go into effect with or without the United States' ratification. The Senate must provide its advice and consent on the treaty and send a resolution of ratification to the President before next Tuesday, so that he may formally ratify the treaty. 
Many hours of intense negotiations have yielded the resolution of ratification to the Chemical Weapons Convention that we are now considering on the Senate floor. This resolution contains 33 conditions which cover nearly every objection raised by opponents of ratification. I am pleased that negotiators have reached an agreement on 28 of those 33 conditions. However, the Senate will have a separate vote on each of the five remaining conditions tomorrow. I would like to stress that approval of any of these conditions would be tantamount to prohibiting U.S. participation in the Chemical Weapons Convention and could fatally damage the effectiveness of this treaty. 
I would like to quickly address these five conditions that threaten ratification of this treaty. Two of these conditions tie our ratification to the actions of other nations. One demands that Russia ratify the treaty first, and the other precludes ratification until the world's rogue nations like Libya and Iraq ratify the treaty. 
The logic behind these two amendments is that the convention is meaningless if it does not include all nations with the capability to develop and use chemical weapons. This logic is seriously flawed. 
The CWC would impose trade restrictions on nonmember nations that will curb their ability to obtain the materials used in making chemical agents. In addition, by establishing an international legal standard opposing the manufacture and use of chemical weapons, the United States will be able to isolate these pariah states making it more difficult for these nations to acquire chemical weapons. 
Also, since when does the United States allow other nations to dictate American policy? It is ridiculous to suggest that we should compromise our position as a world leader by following the lead of fringe countries. 
President Reagan did not wait for other nations when he declared that this Nation would unilaterally destroy its chemical weapons stockpile. He did not wait for other nations when he initiated negotiations to ban chemical weapons from the Earth. We did not follow others in making those critical decisions. We led and others fell in behind us. This Nation set the example. And now it is time for us once again to lead and set the example. 
In fact, perhaps the greatest way to ensure that Russia and other countries with offensive chemical weapons programs will not endorse this treaty, would be for the United States to reject this treaty. Seventy-three other nations, including all of our major allies, and two-thirds of all countries with chemical weapon capabilities, have already endorsed this treaty. I hope that we will align ourselves with those who have ratified the convention and not with those outlaw nations. 
Another condition that will be considered as an amendment would bar individual inspectors because they come from a country that supported terrorism or violated U.S. nonproliferation law. If a particular inspector has a past history of spying or assisting terrorists, we must prevent him or her from inspecting our facilities. But if we bar certain inspectors based solely on their nationality, other countries will certainly bar U.S. inspectors. In addition, these will likely be the countries that we would most like to monitor. 
Another condition that would surely kill the ratification agreement demands a level of verification that simply cannot be guaranteed. Like every other arms control agreement, this one is not 100 percent verifiable. Certainly, that is not a reason to avoid ratifying this treaty. The question ought to be: Are verification measures under this treaty better or worse than those we have now? 
The answer to that question must be `yes.' This treaty includes tougher verification measures than any existing arms control agreement to the extent that it allows for frequent inspections of both governmental and commercial chemical manufacturing plants throughout the world. And while chemical weapons are generally more difficult to detect than conventional weapons, the U.S. intelligence community has confidence that it will be able to detect a large scale effort to develop chemical weapons. 
The remaining condition of the ratification resolution is perhaps the most contentious, and it would certainly kill all hopes of ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention if it were to pass as an amendment tomorrow. 
In today's Washington Post, my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Helms writes: `* * * the one issue that has raised the greatest concern among Senators--the issue on which the ratification vote will almost certainly hinge--is the Clinton Administration's refusal to modify the treaty's Articles 10 and 11.' His next sentence is particularly important, `These controversial provisions require the transfer of dangerous chemical agents, defensive gear and know-how to any nation that joins the CWC.' With all due respect to my colleague from North Carolina, the simple fact of the matter is that this statement is not true. Article 10 does not require the United States or any other signatory to share advanced chemical weapons defense technologies and equipment with other countries or to assist them in the development of such capabilities. 
I hope that all of my colleagues, who are considering opposing the CWC for this reason, will simply refer to the actual text of the convention to understand the true implications of the treaty. 
Paragraph 7 of article 10 states: `Each State Party undertakes to provide assistance through the Organization and to this end to elect to take one or more of the following measures.' One of the choices is, `to declare, not later than 180 days after the Convention enters into force for it, the kind of assistance it might provide in response to an appeal by the Organization.' In no way does this language require any country to share advanced chemical defense technology and equipment. In fact, 1 of the 28 conditions agreed to in the resolution of ratification will ensure that no assistance other than medical antidotes and treatments is provided by the United States under article 10. 
Opponents of the convention have also raised concerns regarding paragraph 3 of article 10. It reads as follows: `Each State Party undertakes to facilitate, and shall have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, material, and scientific and technological information concerning means of protection against chemical weapons.' The inclusion of the word `right' underscores that each signatory state has a right, not an obligation, to exchange materials and information. 
In fact, President Clinton confirmed this interpretation when he recently stated: `We have made it clear that, as regards to other countries, we will not do anything to give them our technology * * * and that our response will be * * * limited to helping them deal with the health effects of an attack. We will help people in medical ways and with other things having to do with the health consequences.' 
The national security concerns raised by Senator Helms were shared by the representatives of the Reagan and Bush administrations who negotiated this treaty. That is why treaty negotiators took great lengths to ensure that the treaty's language would be carefully crafted to protect America's interests. In responding to the criticisms of article 10 of the convention, I'll simply use the words of former Secretary of State James Baker: `The suggestion that Presidents Bush and Reagan would negotiate a treaty detrimental to the nation's national security is outrageous.' 
I hope that my colleagues will not take the criticisms of this critically important treaty at face value and will closely examine the actual text. 
The final condition which opponents of the treaty seek to raise relates to cooperation in the field of chemical activities for businesses. Critics argue that the CWC might force industry to share manufacturing and trade secrets with other nations. These criticisms are completely unfounded. Fred Webber, president and CEO of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, criticized these allegations stating that, `the Chemical Weapons Convention does not obligate us to turn over trade secrets, and it most certainly does not require the U.S. to abolish its system of export controls on dual-use chemistry. The CWC raises the export control bar for other nations to the high standard already set by the United States. That's why this treaty is in the national interest.' In fact, it is ironic that critics of the treaty argue that they support the interests of America's chemical and pharmaceutical companies. Yet, if we fail to ratify this treaty, these very same companies will be subject to trade restrictions that were devised by the United States. 
Members of this body must examine the elements that set this agreement apart from others. The Chemical Weapons Convention was signed by nearly every nation in the world; it penalizes nations that refuse to sign on; it provides for routine and challenge inspections; and it creates an international norm that would prohibit the very existence of chemical weapons. We must recognize that there has never been an arms control treaty that better accounted for the skeptic's concerns than this one. 
Today we live in a world of nations that increasingly act together. In this time of economic unions, coalition forces, and multinational businesses, we can ill-afford to disengage from the international community. If we do not ratify this treaty or if we accept conditions that prevent our ratification, we will careen off the course that we set for ourselves and the other peace-loving nations of the world. 
Worse, we will force the nations who have ratified the treaty to decide between ridding the world of chemical weapons on the one hand and maintaining good trade relations with the richest nation in the world on the other. If we force our allies to make decisions like that, they'll be justified in looking elsewhere for leadership. 
I strongly believe that ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is in the best interests of the United States, and I urge my colleagues to support this historic treaty.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, let me address if I can--and there are a couple matters I want to speak on--the issue of Alexis Herman. I have listened here to my colleagues address their concern about the Executive order regarding project labor agreements. My hope is that we would not be holding Alexis Herman hostage over a particular matter that Members have some concern about. And I respect that. I note my good friend and colleague from Oklahoma is still on the floor. It was back in I think 1991 when President Bush issued an Executive order to prohibit project labor agreements. I do not recall a similar outcry that this was acting without legislative authority. 
I do not disagree, I say to my colleague, by the way, with his concern where executive branches, regardless of party, try to exceed their authority here. But nonetheless, I hope that despite the legitimacy or illegitimacy, whatever one's point of view is, on project labor agreements, Alexis Herman's nomination can go forward. She was proposed in December. The election was in November. This is almost May. We are missing a Secretary of Labor. And whether it is organized labor, unions, management, it is important there be someone at that table to represent the interests of management and labor. 
And the Secretary of Labor needs to be there. 
My colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, I think addressed this issue appropriately back, as the Presiding Officer will recall, when there was some question of whether or not the nomination was going to move through the committee which the Presiding Officer and I sit on together, the Labor and Human Resources Committee. There, the Senator from Pennsylvania noted we ought to vote on these people up or down, but we ought to at least vote. 
The committee voted unanimously to send Alexis Herman's name to the full Senate for consideration. As I said a moment ago, now it is getting to be late April. I am told her nomination will not be considered until something is worked out on these project labor agreements. I think that is regrettable. Again, I will discuss in a moment the project labor agreement issue. Six months after an election, to be missing yet a meaningful and important member of the President's Cabinet, I think is an unfortunate use of our power here, to deny the Senate even a vote on this nomination. So I hope we would have that nomination come sooner rather than later, so we could have that individual sitting at the Cabinet table.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me briefly address these project labor agreements. Again, this is maybe confusing to some people because it sounds rather esoteric: Project labor agreement. There is nothing new about project labor agreements. They go back to the 1930's. They have been a very effective means by which governing bodies, States, cities and the Federal Government, where there have been major public works projects, have been able to bring people together to try to work out arrangements, in terms of wages, benefits, hours and so forth, in return for which there would be no work stoppages, strikes and the like. 
I note Governor Pataki of New York has very effectively used project labor agreements on projects in the State of New York. Christine Todd Whitman, the Governor of New Jersey, has used project labor agreements on major public works projects in the State of New Jersey. There are numerous projects around the country, Federal projects--the Boston Harbor is the one I am most familiar with in New England--where there is a project labor agreement there. 
I might point out it was noted by our colleague from Texas that these project labor agreements result in tremendous cost overruns. It is estimated right now, and the project is not complete--the estimated cost of the Boston Harbor project was $6.1 or $6.3 billion. It is estimated now, in no small measure because of the project labor agreement, that project may be completed for about $3.4 billion, substantially under the original estimates. So there is nothing inherent in this that says it is going to increase costs. In fact, it has worked very, very well. 
The suggestion was also that nonunion businesses would be prohibited from bidding. Nothing could be further from the truth. That would be against the law. In fact, I think, as someone pointed out, in one of the Boston projects--102 of the 257 subcontractors were nonunion firms; 102 of the 257. So the notion that nonunion firms would be prohibited from being a part of these projects is unfounded. 
As I noted earlier, in October of 1992, President Bush issued an Executive order which prohibited Federal agencies and Federal contractors from entering into these project labor agreements. So the outrage that is being expressed because an Executive order has been issued to reinstate them--as I said, I would be sympathetic if the outrage had been focused equally vociferously when President Bush banned these project labor agreements--as we now hear with this President's decision to issue or allow these project labor agreements to be used on Federal projects. 
So, again on the Alexis Herman issue I hope she will go forward. 
On these project labor agreements, I think it is important we 
utilize what has been a very effective tool for being able to complete very, very important public works projects. As I said earlier, these are not just used by the executive branch at the national level, they have been used by Governors all across the country.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, tomorrow, the 23d of April, will mark the 10th anniversary of a major tragedy in the State of Connecticut. It was April 23, 1987, that 28 workers in Bridgeport, CT, lost their lives at a place called L'Ambiance Plaza, a construction site. My colleague from Indiana may recall that it was the largest industrial accident we had ever had in the State of Connecticut. It occurred during the construction of an apartment building using a technique called lift-slab construction. You would actually construct the floors and then, by hydraulic lift, lift the floors up. Within a matter of seconds, these floors collapsed and took the lives of 28 of my constituents from Connecticut. 
It was a dreadful day, one that people still talk about in our State. In fact, early next week there will be a memorial service, with the families and others who are still feeling the pain of the loss of their loved ones. 
We ended up banning, in the State of Connecticut, lift-slab construction. There were Federal regulations put out on that construction as well. As a result of that accident, in fact, my colleague from Connecticut, Congressman Christopher Shays, who represents that congressional district, he and I introduced legislation to create some new requirements to monitor health and safety on construction sites. That legislation would have created an office of construction safety. It would have created a 15-member advisory committee on construction safety. 
I should back up and point out that of all trades, the construction trades suffer the most injuries and death. Even with a lot of improvements, it is highly dangerous work. So, even with the improvements that have been made in occupational safety and health, construction work, just by its nature, as one would well imagine, is very dangerous. What we were looking for was to create some specific emphasis and focus on the construction trades. So that bill required those two points and further required increased civil and criminal penalties when there were knowing violations of occupational safety and health standards, and it would require employers to develop specific procedures to ensure health and safety on building sites. The bill was never approved. We offered it and had hearings on it, but it was never approved. 
If you, Mr. President, and my colleagues had seen L'Ambiance Plaza, the devastation there, I think most would have come to the same conclusion that I did, that we need to do a better job in monitoring these construction sites. I pointed out, it was the single largest construction tragedy in the State of Connecticut. The problem is that lift-slab construction had caused hundreds of injuries around the country, yet in most instances, on the specific site, the injury, although it was bad, had not resulted in a death, so reporting was not required. 
So there was no warning ahead of time about the dangers of this type of construction. As a result of our efforts, you would have been required to report those incidents when they happened so the collective information would be gathered and better decisions could be made about this kind of construction. 
So, next week we will again gather to commemorate the lives of the 28 men whose lives were lost on that date 10 years ago. Like all of my colleagues, I hope never to have to attend another such ceremony. My hope is still that we will do a better job in improving the enforcement and the penalties involved, because that seems to be the only way we get the kind of compliance that is necessary.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a subject about which I know the Presiding Officer has a great deal of interest, 
and that is the attention that has most recently been focused on the breakthroughs in our understanding of the human brain and in the early development of children. In fact, Newsweek just released a special edition: `From Birth to Three. What you need to know, how speech begins, a baby's brain, genes, emotions, what is normal, what is not.' I commend Newsweek for dedicating a special issue to this subject matter. I think it is extremely worthwhile. 
Time magazine earlier did an issue on education, which I think was extremely helpful to millions and millions of Americans. I encourage everyone in this country to read this edition, particularly young families. It is very valuable information for people to have. We are gathering new information, almost on a daily basis, about the remarkable events that occur in the earliest days of a child's development, about how important it is that we do everything we can to maximize parental understanding and to provide whatever support we can so these earliest days turn out to be productive days in the development of a child's life. 
As we all know, last week the President and the First Lady hosted an important White House conference on this very topic, bringing together leading voices from around the country to discuss the early development of children and how we could better support that development. Scientists have now presented us with hard evidence of what many parents have long held true--have known, I think instinctively--that children whose lives are stimulated from birth by words, by affection, and by playful interactions with their parents and other devoted caregivers are far more likely to develop to their full intellectual and emotional potential than those who are not. 
All that we already knew about giving children a good start in life still holds true. Genetics, nutrition, whether a mother drinks or smokes--all these factors still play a role in a child's development. Now we also know that the environment that we provide to children, starting at the moment of birth and into their earliest years, has an astonishing impact on their potential to learn and to grow. 
I do not pretend to understand all of the scientific studies. In fact, just the language of it, the jargon of it, can be dazzling for those of us who are lay people in this area. But I am trying to gain a basic grasp of the facts. Scientists have now discovered, for instance, that the brain of a baby is wired to learn. Starting at the very first days, each time a parent holds, rocks, or talks to her child, connections are formed between the neurons of the child's brain. These connections, the building blocks of a child's cognitive and emotional development, grow exponentially in the earliest years. 
Just consider this. By the time a child is 3 years old, that child's brain has formed 1,000 trillion synapses, or connections between brain cells. Just to give some idea of the magnitude of this, this evening if you have a starry night and you look up at the stars, you should know that 1,000 trillion synapses is more than all the stars in the Milky Way. So, as you gaze at the heavens tonight and you look at the Milky Way with all its stars, know that just in 36 months of a child's life there are more synapses and more connections formed than all those stars. That will give you some idea of what is occurring in these earliest days of a child's life. 
Scientists have found that these connections in a child's brain only survive if they are reinforced, a sort of `use-it-or-lose-it' phenomenon. As an example, and I am very familiar with the one I am about to give you, studies have found that children who develop cataracts at an early age lose their ability to see, even after those cataracts are removed because the brain pathways for sight were not allowed to develop during the critical period for achieving sight. Why do I know about this? My oldest sister, Carolyn, a teacher in Connecticut, was born with cataracts many years ago. She is blind today. Had we known, had we had the information we have today, my parents might have been able to do something differently. She has been a wonderful teacher 
and an independent individual, but I was struck when I read of this particular fact by what we know now that we did not know then. 
So this particular discovery came racing home to me in relation to my oldest sister--what a difference the current advances of knowledge and information might have made in her life. Although she has been tremendously successful with her physical handicap, it struck me life might have been a little different for her had the information we know now about the development of the brain been available then. 
Other information shows that a baby who is not read to--the simple act of reading, even before a child can understand the words--that child may later struggle with language skills. Similarly, a child who does not get the chance to play may later have difficulty interacting with peers. 
As the Carnegie Corporation's seminal publication, `Starting Points' so succinctly states:  
How individuals function from preschool years all the way through adolescence and even adulthood hinges, to a significant extent, on the experiences children have in their first three years. 
What does this exciting research mean to us as policymakers? I think it means that what we thought of as `early interventions' to help children learn may not have been early enough. It means that programs for school-age children and even for preschool children miss a window of opportunity, the extraordinary potential for learning that exists in a child's brain before the age of 3. 
It means we need to start even earlier, at the first day of a child's life with guaranteed parental leave, for instance, which the Chair was so instrumental in helping us pass a few years ago. Providing even those few months for parents who have to work to be with their children is a lot better than they used to have. As the Chair knows, I would like to lower the threshold from 50 employees to 25, so we can include 13 million additional people in the country who today cannot take advantage of family leave. I am still going to try to persuade him to support this. I hope we will lower the threshold so more families can take advantage, even for 12 weeks, of the opportunity to stimulate a child's early development. 
In short, I think it means for us as policymakers that we need to think carefully and critically about what we are doing for children in their earliest years. I believe we in the Senate have an extraordinary opportunity to help families, to ensure that our Nation's children are able to grasp and reach the highest rungs of their potential. 
I have also joined with several of my colleagues to introduce the Working Family Child Care Act of 1997. Given these scientific findings, quality child care can no longer be considered a luxury. This bill will provide $500 million to meet supply shortages, including the acute shortage of high-quality infant care. Let's talk about the families who have no choice--not the families who have the choice of working or not. I have my own feelings about that issue--but, let's talk about the families who have no choice, they have to work. Or let's talk about the parent who is raising children on her own. The best thing is a caring parent, but if for whatever reason that caring parent cannot be with that child all the time, then we have to make sure that in child-care settings there are quality caregivers so these infants, in the earliest days, get the next best thing to a mom and dad. 
I am hopeful, as a result of this new information, we can develop broad-based, bipartisan support for quality child care. We have done a lot on the availability of child care, but the quality of the care has to be good as well. If a parent cannot be there with that child, then the child care provider has to know what they are doing. Hopefully, we will get support on this issue. 
Our chairman, Senator Jeffords of Vermont, is taking a leadership role in this area, and I commend him for it. I am soon going to introduce a bill that will put us on a path to fully funding Head Start. Again, this has been a controversial matter. We have authorized full funding, but we have never come up with the money. We know Head Start works and makes a difference in the lives of children. Hopefully, we can get broad-based support. It is expensive, I know it. But, we have to come up with a means to do it. 
We have to look at our priorities in light of this new information. Whether it is 5 years, 7 years, or 8 years, we need to say that at the end of that time, we will fully fund Head Start. I am willing to talk with anyone about the fastest possible way to do this. 
Recently, our colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, with Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts, introduced legislation to insure our children and to thereby ensure that untreated injuries or illnesses do not impede a child's development in the most critical years. I commend them for their work. 
Mr. President, there are a lot of good things going on that our colleagues are working on. I urge, in light of some of these studies--I mentioned a moment ago this Newsweek article which I think will be very helpful--that we try to pull together here to figure out how we can support these families, these children, 
recognizing the economic pressures, all the things that make it more difficult today than in earlier days to raise families the way the Presiding Officer and I may have been raised. That is not possible for many people today. So we need to try to come up with support structures that will allow families to at least approximate that world that existed for many of us--not for ala--in a time when one parent worked and another stayed home and raised the family. 
I know the Presiding Officer cares about this very much. I have had the privilege of working with him on these issues. I look forward to being involved with him on this one as well. There are a lot of good things we can do to assist families. With this new information coming to us, not only is it desirous, but I think we have no other choice but to act and to see to it that these children get the best start they possibly can. 
Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's indulgence in allowing me a little more time than I otherwise would have taken. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate Resolution 72, to allow disabled people with floor privileges to bring supporting services onto the floor with them when appropriate. For years, the disability community has fought for the right to be included and to be brought into the economic and social mainstream of American life. This resolution represents one more step forward in that long struggle to win equal treatment. 
Throughout our history, the rules of the Senate have served us extraordinarily well. They enable us to preserve order and decorum so that the affairs of our Nation can be debated, discussed, and considered in a reasoned, deliberate manner. Yet, as is true of any set of rules, occasionally the need for change becomes apparent. Such a moment occurred in the Senate on Monday when a Senator sought floor privileges for a member of his staff who is blind and utilizes a guide dog in her work. 
As a body, we responded to this moment as we should have: Carefully, deliberately, and swiftly. The staff member in question was granted access to the floor, and Senate Resolution 72 was promptly referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration. I am hopeful that, in due course, we will revise our rules to allow all people with disabilities to bring supporting services with them to the floor when appropriate. 
Former Senator Lowell Weicker of my home State once said that people with disabilities spend a lifetime overcoming not what God wrought but what man imposed by custom and law. This resolution gratefully eliminates some of those customs and laws. It is an important step for disabled Americans, for the Senate, and for the entire country.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this past Tuesday, more than 34,000 baseball fans, including President Clinton, came to Shea Stadium in New York to honor Jackie Robinson on the 50th anniversary of his breaking the color barrier for major league baseball. For all Americans, and especially for African-Americans, Jackie Robinson's historic achievement was a source of inspiration, and it forever changed the face of our society. 
Jackie Robinson's legacy is of particular importance to the State of Connecticut, because Jackie Robinson's family retired to Stamford in 1956. Among those in attendance at Shea Stadium on Tuesday were 640 children from Stamford, who are participants in the Jackie Robinson Park of Fame project. The project's goal is to celebrate Jackie Robinson's life and instill our young people with courage and confidence. 
Hopefully, these children will learn about Jackie Robinson's heroic feats on the baseball diamond, and, most of all, the grace with which he overcame the many obstacles that were placed in his path as he sought to almost single-handedly integrate our national pastime. More important, I hope that these children and all Americans will learn about Jackie Robinson's sacrifices away from baseball and his undying commitment to uplifting his race and his country. 
For anyone who saw Jackie Robinson play, they would probably be surprised to learn that some believe baseball was Jackie's worst sport. He was UCLA's first-ever four-sport letterman, starring in football, basketball, and track, as well as baseball. While there were many Negro League players who were talented enough to play in the major leagues, Jackie Robinson was a special person whose intelligence, character, and athleticism uniquely qualified him to become major league baseball's first African-American player. 
When Brooklyn Dodgers' President Branch Rickey signed Jackie Robinson to break baseball's color line, Jackie had to agree that, for two full seasons, he would turn the other cheek no matter what abuse was directed at him by opposing players and fans. Jackie Robinson withstood a seemingly endless barrage of verbal, physical, and psychological assaults and was still able to excel in nearly every facet of the game with an uncommon dignity. When Robinson would slide into second base with an easy double, the opposing shortstop would sometimes slam Jackie in the face with his glove so hard that you could hear it in the dugout. In response, Jackie Robinson would simply stand up, dust himself off, and then steal third on the very next pitch. 
Jackie Robinson's quiet humility and devotion to principle stand in sharp contrast to today's pro athletes who seem more interested in corporate sponsorships and performance bonuses in their multimillion dollar contracts than in giving back to their communities. For Jackie Robinson, baseball was about more than individual statistics and lucrative contracts. It was about breaking down barriers and instilling others with a sense of hope. 
Jackie Robinson's silence did not last forever, and his actions after retiring from baseball are often overlooked but equally deserving of praise. Many would argue that, by integrating baseball, Jackie Robinson had done more for the cause of racial justice than any other individual of that era. But Jackie Robinson did not view his baseball career as the peak of his life, and his greatest contributions to American society may have come after his retirement. 
Whereas his fame and wealth would have allowed him to enjoy a very comfortable retirement, Jackie Robinson remained committed to the fight against racism and social injustice until his death. He helped to establish the Freedom National Bank in Harlem, which provided loans to African-Americans trying to start their own businesses. He also founded his own construction company which built housing for low-income families in New York. 
Jackie Robinson was also active politically. He spoke throughout the country in support of civil rights, participated in protest marches, and raised large sums of money for civil rights organizations. He also worked actively for several politicians who promoted the cause of racial equality. 
Despite all the sacrifices in his life, Jackie Robinson always maintained that there was more work to be done. Hence, he entitled his autobiography, `I Never Had It Made.' He wrote, `I am grateful for all the breaks and honors and opportunities I've had, but I always believe I won't have it made until the humblest black kid in the most remote backwoods of America has it made.' 
Unfortunately, 50 years after the fall of baseball's color barrier and 25 years after Jackie Robinson's death, America still has a long way to go if it hopes to ever meet Jackie Robinson's vision of what America should be. But while we still have not evolved into a society that is completely free from prejudice and social injustice, there are countless visible signs of Jackie Robinson's impact on this country. 
Last week, we all witnessed a true testament to Jackie Robinson's legacy as we watched 21-year-old Tiger Woods become the first person of color to win the Masters--golf's most prestigious tournament. But perhaps the most encouraging aspect of Tiger Woods' performance came during his acceptance speech. Tiger Woods specifically credited Lee Elder, Charlie Sifford, and Teddy Rhodes, the first African-Americans to ever compete at Augusta, for opening doors for him. He acknowledged that, without the sacrifices of trailblazers like these men and Jackie Robinson, very few of today's minority athletes would know the success that they have grown accustomed to. This is why we must celebrate the achievements of Jackie Robinson and other pioneers, because the lessons that they taught us are as relevant today as they were decades ago, and we must heed their words and actions or we will cease to be a progressive society. 
Tuesday night's event at Shea Stadium had many special moments, but the most touching came when Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow, spoke in honor of her husband, and the audience gave her the warm ovation that she so richly deserved. Her sacrifices were as great as her husband's, and too often we forget that Jackie Robinson, who was described as the loneliest man in sports, endured and prevailed only with the support of his partner Rachel, who was always by his side. 
Rachel Robinson sacrificed her own personal aspirations during Jackie's playing career and dedicated herself to raising their children and supporting her husband. But upon their retirement to Connecticut, she earned her master's degree in psychiatric nursing at Yale. She later operated a day clinic for acutely ill psychiatric patients, taught at Yale's School of Nursing, and served as director of nursing for the Connecticut Mental Health Center. Despite her own personal success, Rachel Robinson again displayed tremendous selflessness after Jackie's death in 1972. 
Upon his passing, it would have been easy for Rachel Robinson to continue the pursuit of her own career, but instead she gave up her medical career and dedicated her life to preserving the legacy of her husband. In 1973, she formed the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which has awarded more than 450 college scholarships to minority and disadvantaged students who have exhibited leadership potential and shown a commitment to community service. Throughout his life, Jackie Robinson always stressed the importance of education, and for a man whose life was dedicated to creating opportunities for others, providing young adults the chance to go to college is perhaps the most fitting tribute one could ever pay to this great man. I am proud to say that Rachel Robinson still resides in my home State of Connecticut, and we are truly fortunate to call her one of our own. 
While many glorious words have been spoken in honor of Jackie Robinson, I truly believe that the greatest tribute that we could ever pay to this man would be through our actions. As Rachel Robinson eloquently said, `This anniversary * * * has given us an opportunity to reassess the challenges of the present. It is my passionate hope that we can take this reawakened feeling of unity and use it as a driving force so that each of us can recommit to equality of opportunity for all Americans.' I hope that America will listen to the words of Rachel Robinson and work together to fulfill Jackie's and her dream. 
America is a better place because of Jackie and Rachel Robinson, and I want to thank both of them for their courage and sacrifice.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Yantic Fire Engine Company, located in my home State of Connecticut. It serves the largest territorial district in Norwich. This year, the Yantic Fire Engine Company celebrates its 150th anniversary. Perhaps the oldest volunteer fire company in Connecticut, and possibly the United States, this company has been providing an invaluable service to Yantic and the city of Norwich for 150 years. 
The Yantic Fire Company was created on June 17, 1847, when the Connecticut General Assembly approved its application for charter. The official name of the fire company was Yantic Fire Company No. 1. Rich in tradition and history, this company is unique for many reasons. It still houses some of its original equipment, including an 1847 Waterman hand tub, an 1891 Silsby steamer, and a Silsby hose carriage. These pieces, well maintained and restored, are national treasures. 
In July, the Village of Yantic will host a parade in honor of the Yantic Fire Engine Company's 150 years of service. This sure-to-be impressive celebration will include over 100 fire companies and numerous marching groups. 
I applaud the efforts of the Yantic Fire Engine Company to commemorate their distinguished history. This fire company has worked hard, with pride and distinction to ensure the health and safety of the members of its community. I join with them in paying tribute to those who have given their lives to protecting others, while serving the Yantic Fire Engine Company.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor two Connecticut citizens whose art, talent, and marriage are truly inspirational--Janet Cummings and Peter Good. 
On April 16, Janet and Peter will receive the University of Connecticut's highest honor--the University Medal. The University Medal recognizes outstanding professional achievement, leadership, and distinguished public service on a community, State, national, or international level. As a resident of East Haddam, which is just across the Connecticut River from their home in Chester, I have long been familiar with their impressive contributions to Connecticut's artistic community, and I am very pleased that the University of Connecticut has chosen to honor their careers. 
Janet and Peter first met while attending UConn's Fine Arts College in the mid-1960's, and for more than 20 years they have worked together at their own graphic design studio in the river-valley town of Chester. The philosophy of their design studio, Cummings & Good, has been to extend their own nurturing and collaborative relationship to their clients. This philosophy has proven to be immensely successful, as they have done work for many respected corporate clients. 
This commercial success has allowed Cummings & Good to sustain the cost of providing quality design, but, perhaps more important, it has allowed the studio to do an inordinate amount of work for non profit organizations. Cummings & Good has provided designs for the International Year of the Child, the National Theatre of the Deaf in Chester, Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, and the Special Olympics, which were held in New Haven in 1995. 
On a personal level, Peter's design of the symbol for the University of Connecticut's year-long symposium `Fifty Years After Nuremberg: Human Rights and the Rule of Law,' holds special significance for me. This symposium began with the opening and dedication of the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, which was named for my father who served as a prosecutor at the Nuremberg tribunal. The dedication of this center was one of the proudest moments of my life, and Peter's design truly captured the spirit and essence of the event. 
I am also particularly fond of Peter's designs for the U.S. Postal Service's official 1993 holiday stamps. In fact, I reproduced the image of these stamps for the front of my 1993 Christmas card, and I greatly appreciate Peter's kind permission to use his designs for this purpose. 
It's hard to imagine two more deserving recipients of this award than Janet and Peter, and I congratulate the University of Connecticut for its decision to bestow its highest honor on two members of the artistic community. The arts are at the root of our Nation's cultural heritage, and if we fail to promote the arts and recognize the achievements of creative individuals like Janet Cummings and Peter Good, we run the risk of becoming a society that is devoid of passion and imagination. 
Again, I congratulate Janet Cummings and Peter Good on receiving University Medals, and I hope that they will enjoy at least 30 more years of collaborating in art and marriage.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Michael Goldblatt, who was recently honored as Citizen of the Year by the Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce. 
A longtime civic leader and lifelong resident of Norwich, CT, Michael has utilized his passion for antique cars and ice skating to help better the local community. 
In 1986 he founded the Eastern Connecticut Antique Auto Show. Currently in its 12th year, the show serves as one of the largest and most successful fund-raising events for the chamber of commerce. Today, he is still on the show's executive board and is its chief technical judge. 
What's more, he was the catalyst for efforts to build the Norwich Municipal Ice Rink, which today is home for the New England Sharks Double A youth hockey program. 
Starting with virtually no financial resources, Michael mobilized local officials and helped raise millions of dollars to make his dream of a year-round, fully enclosed ice rink a reality. 
Michael Goldblatt also serves as treasurer of the Norwich Community Development Corp. and has been a member of the board of directors for the Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce, the Norwich Recreation Advisory Board, and the Connecticut Society of CPA's. 
In all his endeavors, Michael has been a tremendous asset to both the city of Norwich and to the entire State of Connecticut. His humanitarian and altruistic efforts are an example that all Americans should emulate. 
I commend the Eastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce on their fine choice and I once again congratulate Michael on his selection as Citizen of the Year. He is a deserving choice.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. My State of Connecticut is heavily dependent on nuclear power. I have long supported this energy source, and long been concerned about how to safely dispose of its waste. 
I support the need for a national, permanent, geological repository for nuclear waste, but I cannot support the bill before us today. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act mandates construction of an above-ground, interim storage facility even before the scientific findings on the permanent repository at Yucca Mountain are completed. The Department of Energy has said that the viability studies for Yucca Mountain should be completed in 1998. 
I remain concerned that construction of an interim facility would effectively stifle efforts to establish a permanent, geological repository. It is a costly and risky diversion from what should be our primary goal in this area: finding a safe, permanent place to store our nation's nuclear waste. We have already spent almost $5 billion on the permanent facility and it is not even finished. It is estimated that the interim facility would cost an additional $2 billion. 
Let me remind you that the interim facility is above ground. If for any reason the scientific assessments for Yucca Mountain are negative, either the interim facility would become the de facto permanent repository without establishing its suitability as such, or the waste would have to be moved again. Either alternative is unacceptable. 
One of the main reasons that I cannot support this bill, is my fear of what could happen if we must move the nuclear waste multiple times. Let us not forget that transporting nuclear waste is inherently risky and any accident or act of terrorism could prove disastrous. I do not want our communities in Connecticut and around the Nation to be at risk because we acted imprudently. 
The supporters of this bill have tried to assure us that transporting nuclear waste is safe, and that environmental safeguards would be in place. I am convinced that this bill does not adequately protect public health and safety and that too many environmental laws are weakened. 
In fact, this bill restricts the Environmental Protection Agency's [EPA] ability to set a drinking water standard at the nuclear waste repository. Let me remind you that last Congress the Senate passed the Safe Drinking Water amendments by a resounding vote of 98-0. Clearly, upholding Federal drinking water standards should be a priority in Nevada no less than in Connecticut. EPA is further restricted in its ability to adequately protect the population from radiation emissions. Granted, EPA can continue to set the annual acceptable dose limit for radiation exposure, but the bill remains vague on any further action that EPA could take to protect the public health and safety from dangerous emission levels. Furthermore, language in the bill is so vague that it is unclear whether compliance with the Clean Water Act or the Clean Air Act would be required. 
It seems to me that threatening public health and safety is the price of expediency. State laws that could slow the process of interim storage are simply preempted. The National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA], passed by Congress in 1969, establishes an environmental impact process for major Federal projects, like Yucca Mountain. The goal of the environmental impact process is to look at all alternatives to ensure that the most environmentally sound alternative is chosen. This bill severely restricts the NEPA decision-making process regarding transportation and the design of either repository. In effect, the public has no role in the decision-making process. 
Now, I would like to clarify a few statements that have been made during this debate regarding the State of Connecticut. 
I recognize the importance of safely storing nuclear waste and the impact this has on my State. It has been said that the situation in Connecticut is urgent. However, it is my understanding that there is sufficient capacity. The fuel pool at one of the facilities in my State should be able to accommodate waste from the other reactors until the end of their licenses and well into the next century. Decisions concerning the fourth facility, Connecticut Yankee, await a final decommissioning plan. 
Last week, my colleague from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, mentioned a Hartford Courant editorial that, I might say, only marginally supported the bill. In fact, I believe the editorial was entitled, `The Lesser of Two Evils'--hardly a rousing endorsement.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the need for increased attention to gun safety. Increasingly, children are gaining access to loaded and unlocked guns with fatal consequences. Recently, an 8-year-old girl in Bridgeport, CT, took a gun that was left behind a couch and shot and killed her 10-year-old sister. 
These tragedies happen far too frequently. A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that nearly 1.2 million latch-key children have access to loaded and unlocked firearms each day. Children cause over 10,000 unintentional shootings each year in which 800 people die. 
This violence is not limited to the home. The Connecticut Department of Health recently completed a survey of 12,000 Connecticut teenagers called the Voice of Connecticut Youth. More than one-third of boys in 9th and 11th grades said they either had a gun or could get one in less than a day. When you consider intentional and unintentional shootings, 16 children are killed with firearms every day in this country. 
We must put an end to the tragedy of gun violence. We need to take steps to ensure that gun owners are storing their guns safely--unloaded, locked, and out of the reach of children. That is why I am cosponsoring Senator Kohl's legislation, S. 428, which requires licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers to sell handguns with a child safety or locking device. The bill also requires a warning that the improper locking or storage of a handgun may result in civil or criminal penalties. 
Today I am also introducing a separate measure that would simply add another section to Senator Kohl's bill. The section would authorize the National Institute of Justice to conduct a study on possible standards for gun locks. As we move to have greater use of gun locks, we ought to make sure that those locks are high quality. 
These small steps forward could save thousands of lives. They will not affect responsible gun owners who are already doing the right thing, but they will remind careless gun owners of the need for increased safety. 
My home State of Connecticut is out in front on this issue. One of our State laws requires locks on handguns, another State law requires that guns be stored away from children. But one State can only do so much. A gun bought outside our State can become an instrument of tragedy within our State. And we also need to make kids across the Nation safer. In many ways, this issue is simple--if we require safety caps on medicine to protect kids, we should clearly require safety locks on guns. 
I urge my colleagues to join with me and Senator Kohl in support of these gun safety measures.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support, as an original cosponsor of the reauthorization of the Mammography Quality Standards Act [MQSA]. 
I first lent my support to this effort when the MQSA was initially introduced and passed in the 102nd Congress. For the past 5 years, this critically important legislation has provided women with safe and reliable mammography services. As the Mammography Quality Standards Act comes up for reauthorization, I urge all of my fellow colleagues to once again make a commitment to the health and well being of America's women by supporting this legislation. 
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer to affect women. In fact, almost 1 in 9 women will develop breast cancer at some point in their lives. Mammography, while not a cure for cancer, provides the best detection system for diagnosing this dangerous and deadly disease. And, early detection of breast cancer is often the key to effective treatment and recovery. 
The Mammography Quality Standards Act ensures that mammography service providers comply with Federal requirements. These quality standards guard against inaccurate or inconclusive mammography results, thereby reducing the costly procedures associated with false positive diagnoses. 
Before this legislation was originally enacted, women were often at the mercy of their mammography service provider, unaware if these providers lacked the necessary equipment, or even adequately trained technicians. The MQSA is helping to effectively eliminate concerns of substandard mammography and its possibly tragic results by assuring that only the correct radiological equipment is used in mammography testing. Further, this legislation is assuring women that only physicians adequately trained in this medical area are interpreting mammograms. 
New to this legislation are some additional requirements which seek to further assure women that their mammogram service produces the most accurate and timely detection of any irregularities. Mammography service providers will now be required to retain women's mammogram records so that an accurate medical history is maintained. Reauthorization of these quality standards will also ensure that patients are notified about substandard mammography facilities. 
I wish to commend Senator Mikulski for her leadership on this crucial legislation. Again, it is my pleasure to join my colleagues in ensuring that quality mammography service is readily available, and I urge the Senate to act quickly and approve this critically important measure for American women.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding. 
Let me begin these brief remarks by commending him and, of course, our good friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, who is the lead sponsor of this legislation, for his efforts here, along with our colleague from Massachusetts who historically, of course, has taken the leadership role over the last number of decades on health-care-related issues. 
Our colleague from Utah and I have had the pleasure and privilege of working together on major legislation. When he says, if you have a bill with Orrin Hatch's name on it, there is a good chance it is going to become law, I can testify to that, having worked with him on the act for better child care. Today millions of people have accidental health care and decent child care because of his efforts. So I commend, Mr. President, both of our colleagues. 
I offered the first child health care package almost 4 years ago to deal with children's health. As both of our colleagues have pointed out, Mr. President, we have about 10 to 10.5 million children in the country who do not have any health care at all. In my State of Connecticut, about 110,000 children are without any health care coverage at all. 
What makes this so ironic in many ways, Mr. President--as we have gone through a debate on welfare reform fairly recently--is that 88 percent of the parents of these children without health care are working. The assumption I think a lot of people must have is that children without health care are the children of parents who are living on public assistance. Nothing could be further from the truth. If you are on public assistance, you get health care, you get Medicaid. If you are out of work on welfare, you get Medicaid. If you are in jail, you get health care in this country. But God help you if you are a working family out there working at the lower income levels trying to provide for your family when we have a seen a dramatic increase in the reduction of private health care coverage. 
Mr. President, I asked for a General Accounting Office study a number of months ago, the results of which came back about a few weeks ago on what has happened to private health insurance for working families. We have seen about a 4.5 to 5 percent increase nationwide in the number of families who have dropped or been dropped from private health insurance. In 1993, 29 million families lost their health care coverage in this country. And the premium costs went up. Small employers decided to drop it altogether. 
So we have watched a tremendous increase in the number of families, working families, with children without any kind of health care coverage at all. 
Many of our State laws, Mr. President, require, under law, that you insure your automobile. Many of our State laws, if not all of them, require that if you have a home mortgage, there be insurance on your house. All that we are suggesting here today is that if you have a child, there ought to be health care coverage or insurance for that child. 
If it is mandatory that your home be insured, if it is mandatory your car be insured, if you are out of work and on public assistance you get health care, if you are in prison you get health care, what our colleagues from Massachusetts and Utah, and those of us who are supporting them, are suggesting, is that if you are a working family in this country, your children--your children--also ought to have a safety net for health care. So this proposal does just that. 
Mr. President, I will just conclude with a story. We had a press conference announcing this GAO study a few days ago. I brought with me a woman from Connecticut. Both she and her husband work. Her husband is in construction. She works for a nonprofit organization in the State of Connecticut. They have two children. Their oldest boy has a serious mental health problem. It is a serious mental health illness with a cost of over $1,000 a month, on average, for medication. They have run out of support from the State program. There is not going to be any more. They were left with this choice--until someone stepped in and made an exception in their case--but left with this choice: Either they could quit their jobs and go on public assistance and get health care for that child, that is one option, 
or the other was to take their child and turn him over to the State, give up custody and let him become a ward of the State, so that then the child could get health care coverage. 
We hear people talking of family values and families staying together all the time. But somehow, in this situation, this family wants desperately to keep custody of their child, and they keep working and they get no help whatever. There is something fundamentally erroneous about the situation that presently exists that if you work and want to keep your children, you run the risk of losing the health care, whereas if you go on public assistance or give up the custody of your child, you can get health care coverage. 
Mr. President, the suggestion of both of our colleagues is to fill in this gap that exists for these 10 1/2 million children today that are without any health care coverage. The numbers are growing, by the way. This is not a number that is declining, but is a number that is growing. 
They have come up with a funding scheme that I think most people will support in this country. It is controversial. Obviously, some will object to how this is paid for. I think it is a very sound idea to come up with this funding scheme and also to allocate some of the resources for deficit reduction. 
Again, Mr. President, if we can insure our cars by law, our homes by law, if you are on welfare or in prison and you get health care coverage, at the very least, we ought to do the same for America's children. This legislation allows us to do that. I commend both of our colleagues and look forward to adoption of the law.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true public servant and a dear friend, Bernard Neville of Cromwell, CT. 
Bernie was honored this past Saturday as the Democrat of the Year by the Cromwell Democratic Town Committee, for his nearly 25 years of service as Cromwell's town clerk and treasurer. I join all the residents of Cromwell in congratulating and honoring Bernie on his impressive record of achievement. 
Over the past 30 years, Bernie has also been a loyal and faithful Democrat. He's not only served as chairman of the town committee, but several times worked as cocoordinator of Congresswoman Barbara Kennelly's election campaign. Most of all, he s been an invaluable asset in energizing and registering Democratic voters. 
The fact is, public servants like Bernard Neville serve as the backbone of our democracy. They don't receive much attention, but they are truly an essential element of our representative government. 
You don't often see them on Sunday talk shows or on the front page of the New York Times, Washington Post, or Hartford Courant. They're not much interested in partisanship or political maneuvering. But, on a local level they ensure that public services are provided and local tax dollars are spent wisely. 
For the past 25 years, Bernie ensured that town elections ran smoothly, citizen petitions and lawsuits were filed correctly, local funds were shrewdly invested and Cromwell's government was working for the benefit of its citizens. In that time, he's done his job with professionalism, integrity, and a strong commitment to serving the people of Cromwell. 
I congratulate and thank him for his efforts. 
I am also pleased to note that even at 83 years young, he plans to continue working toward his degree at Trinity College, where he is majoring in history. I wish Bernie the best of luck in all his future endeavors and congratulate him again on this wonderful honor.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for the Chafee-Rockefeller Safe Adoptions and Families Environments Act [SAFE]. What's more, I commend each of them for their tireless and bipartisan efforts on behalf of this issue. 
As I come to the floor today, it is difficult for me to imagine a more outrageous and disgraceful form of violence than child abuse. 
However, while national attention to the problems of abuse are increasing, regrettably, so too are incidents of child abuse and neglect. 
In fact, the number of abused and neglected children nearly doubled from 1.4 million in 1986 to over 2.8 million in 1993. During that period the number of children who were seriously injured quadrupled--from about 143,000 to nearly 570,000. 
In my own State of Connecticut incidents of child abuse and neglect increased 118 percent from 1984 to 1994. In fact, between 1993 and 1994 alone there was a 43-percent increase. 
Unfortunately, many child welfare agencies lack the resources to effectively deal with the increase in child abuse cases or efficiently place children in safe, permanent, and loving homes. 
Legislation introduced today by Senators Chafee and Rockefeller, of which I am an original cosponsor, would do more to not only protect these abused children but also ensure that they are not returned to environments where they will be abused or neglected. 
First, it would work to ensure that abused and neglected children are placed in safe and protected settings. 
Second, it would more rapidly move children out of the foster system and into permanent homes. 
If there is one thing that all of us can agree upon it is the importance of assuring the safety and well-being of our Nation's children. This bill would improve our child welfare system and help ensure that every child is given the opportunity to grow up in a safe and healthy home. 
I urge all my colleagues to join me in a bipartisan manner, and support this critically important legislation for our children's future.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes of leader's time, and I will try to use less than that time. 
Let me begin these remarks by thanking the sponsors of this resolution that is pending before the Senate. I want to especially thank our colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, with whom I have the pleasure of serving with as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, Narcotics and Terrorism of the Committee on Foreign Relations. He played a very major role in shaping the compromise that is now before us. I would mention as well our colleagues, Dianne Feinstein from California, Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, John McCain of Arizona, and others who worked tirelessly in helping put this resolution together. 
I commend them for their work in putting this resolution together. I am happy to have been a part of it. Even though I do not agree with every word in it, on balance I believe it is a very constructive approach to a very difficult problem. I am sure that all of us who worked to forge this compromise would have liked to see things added or subtracted depending upon our points of view. But, that is the nature of how a resolution like this is assembled. 
I think the pending amendment captures the views of this body fairly accurately, and I suspect, the views of the American people whom we represent. Yes, there is a sense of outrage, fear, worry, and frustration over the ongoing threat posed by the Mexican drug cartels. We have paid a very heavy price for their relentless efforts to ply their trade whereever they can get away with it. The human costs of drug use are real and mounting. This scourge that still ravages this country called drugs has caused great damage to millions of people in this country and elsewhere. 
The pending amendment is an attempt to express to our neighbor and ally to the south of us, Mexico, where more than 50 percent of all the drugs that come to this country are produced or transit through, that we would like to see more cooperation in our efforts to eliminate drugs from both our countries. 
Mr. President, the economic costs to the American people from the illegal use of narcotics is in excess $67 billion annually. Estimates are that nearly 13 million Americans regularly use illegal substances. The revenues generated by the drug kingpins totals more than $49 billion annually--a rather remarkable statistic. 
The Mexican drug cartels allocate more than $6 billion of ill gotten gains for the sale of drugs in order to bribe, or otherwise corrupt Mexican law enforcement and judicial authorities involved in counternarcotics programs. 
We consume 50 percent of all the illegal drugs produced in the world. We represent 5 percent of the world's population. So clearly the United States is at the heart of the international drug problem. More and more, this is not solely an American problem. Drug consumption is beginning to ravage countries which in the past never had a problem with illegal substances and drugs. 
But today that is changing, and even in producing countries--transit countries--nations where money laundering goes on, consumption and the ravages of consumption are beginning to wreak havoc in these nations as well. 
I cite just of few statistics. There are clearly many more. I know my colleague from California provided some other statistics in the course of her remarks concerning, for example, the amount of product coming into this country. 
Let me say that I think it is perfectly appropriate and proper that we raise the issue of the effectiveness of our allies and neighbors' counter-narcotics efforts. But we should admit as well that we could do a better job here at home in helping to wage an all out effort against illegal drug use. We need to take a good hard look in the mirror as well. 
I would argue very strenuously that were it not for the consumption in this country, were it not for our consumption problems, that we would have far less of a problem with nations like Mexico and others. I don't say that is an excuse to let those nations off the hook who produce, process, and tranship these illegal drugs that wind up on our streets. But if we are going to have an intelligent and thoughtful discussion about drug abuse and illegal drug production, and the problems these create, then we need to spend at least as much time in analyzing what we in the United States are doing or are not doing in our own country that creates the market for these products as we do pointing the accusing finger at those who are involved on the supply side. 
Simply put, if we did not have a domestic consumption problem we would not have the magnitude of the problem of the supply side that exists in Mexico today. With enough resources we can probably deal with Mexico. Or we can deal with Peru, and Colombia. But what we have learned historically is that as we begin to put pressure on narcotraffickers in one country, they simply relocate to another. This will continue to be the case so long as our domestic consumption rates continue to go up. The producing countries, the transit countries, the money laundering countries, are only temporary locations in the transnational international drug trafficking business. 
So the first line of defense has to be a far more aggressive effort here at home to try to educate young people against the dangers and the problems associated with illegal drug use. We also need better treatment programs so that those who are hooked on drugs who want to change will have someplace to go to for help in breaking these incredibly debilitating habits. Yet today, there is a long waiting list at our drug treatment centers--a list of addicts wanting treatment that is currently unavailable to many of them. The waiting period to get into treatment can be as long as 4 years in some instances. Having to wait months and months for treatment certainly doesn't contribute to our efforts to reduce the problem of consumption. 
I hope as we attempt to seriously come to grips with the international drug threat to the United States --and it is not going to disappear overnight--that we focus a lot of our attention on reducing domestic drug abuse. 
Just as I believe we need to place more emphasis on the demand side, I think we need a serious rethinking of how we approach the supply side of the equation. The current approach as embodied in the annual certification process is not working. In 1986 when Congress enacted the drug certification law there was a great deal of frustration that neither the United States nor other countries were doing enough to fight the drug war. So Congress, on a bipartisan basis, set up a certification process in order to bring attention to the issue and try to do something about it. I strongly suggest to my colleagues--and I realize that I may be in the minority on this issue--that we ought to scrap this certification process and try to come up with some alternative idea that would allow us to develop a working partnership with other governments, particularly those in our own hemisphere. 
There are good people in Mexico who want to see this problem 
stopped as well. 
In fact, I made note the other day--it is worth repeating here today--that when President Zedillo of Mexico came forward and took some significant steps in dealing with the people in his own country who had been corrupted by this process, his favorability rating rose more than 10 percent in Mexican public opinion polls. It isn't just American citizens who are deeply troubled by the rising cost of illegal substances and drugs. The people of Mexico, the average citizen in the street, is worried about this. The mother in Mexico City is just as worried about her child becoming hooked on these substances as a mother in Hartford, or a mother in Atlanta, or a mother in Los Angeles. We need to be sensitive to that because they have to help us as well in trying to build a base of public support in Mexico that will encourage Mexican authorities to get tough on narcotraffickers and corrupt government officials. 
My colleague from Georgia may have addressed this already. I will just state it briefly. I think our colleague from Georgia has a very sound idea in terms of how we might look at this problem a bit differently. He has proposed that all countries that are involved in the various aspects of the drug trade, whatever their level of involvement, sit down and start figuring out how we can work together to solve this problem. It isn't going to be solved in one year or two. It isn't going to be solved at all unless we come up with a common plan--a plan developed by coequals trying to deal with this issue. That is the only way to get the kind of cooperation that is absolutely critical if we are going to be successful in dealing with our allies and others who are producing these products. 
I see my colleague. I will be glad to yield to him because I raised his name and mentioned his program.

Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for mentioning that. 
I strongly urge the administration and others to take a strong, hard look at this and come forward with ideas so we can get off the certification track that brings us back here year in and year out picking winners and losers and deciding whether or not they are going to be on the good list, or the bad list, or the marginally good list. Whether they are going to be certified, decertified, or granted a national interest waiver. Debating that kind of question and getting votes of 55 to 45 or 65 to 30 for the various legislative initiatives surrounding certification doesn't get us anywhere. 
We have significant evidence that decertification has not fostered better cooperation from other countries. For the last 11 years we have decertified a handful of countries year in and year out. None of these countries counter narcotics efforts have improved as a result of that action. 
The simple question that must be asked about the current procedure is if it is not working should it continue? Shouldn't we consider an alternative that might really be effective in achieving the cooperation that is necessary to reduce the ravages of this problem? 
If we don't try something new, we will be sitting here, I promise you, with more charts next year and more charts the year after that, and more charts the year after that, and we can beat our chests, pound the table, and scream at neighbors and allies. But my fear is that it doesn't get any better. 
So, when your idea is not working very well, you ought to think anew. What the Senator from Georgia has done in my view is think anew on this. I commend him for it. I don't think he thinks nor do I think it is a perfect idea. But I think it has the seeds of success written into it. If we give it a chance and try to make it work, then I think it can produce the results that we all are looking for. 
Mr. President, again I commend the authors of this amendment. I think they have expressed the views of all of us more or less. We are all blessed to have General McCaffrey heading up narcotics efforts. He has done an excellent job and he enjoys universal support for his efforts. 
I urge the adoption of this amendment. But, more importantly, Mr. President, I urge that we find a different way in the coming weeks and months to address this issue before we find ourselves back again engaged in an exercise that isn't achieving the kind of results that many of us would like to see accomplished. 
With that, Mr. President, I urge adoption of the resolution and yield the floor.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. DODD. This is one of the most serious problems we face, not only when there is stockpiling, but in other areas. I think most Americans, when they go by and see ponds drained down, know that one of the things that always show up is tires. It is a real pollution problem, beyond just the collection in one site. 
I think the Senator from Rhode Island has offered a very creative and worthwhile suggestion that all of America will benefit from, so I commend him for the effort.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the resolution that is before us, and is the question of whether or not there ought to be an independent counsel. 
Let me suggest here that there are three or four other items I want to talk about later. I am also interested in talking about the investigation that will be moving forward now as a result of last week's vote; the Federal Election Commission and some idea on a piece of legislation I will introduce with regard to that, and then the proposed McCain-Feingold legislation. I presume this has been somewhat confusing to someone watching this out there, with all these various resolutions and debates going on. But they are issues all related to the same subject matter. 
Mr. President, let me just briefly say, with regard to the resolution before us, as someone who appreciates the role of having a statute dealing with independent counsel, I, for one, along with others--and I am not alone in this regard--have expressed some reservations and concerns about the independent counsel route generally, putting aside any specific matters. I was one who voted against establishing an independent counsel in the case of former President Bush when there were allegations raised involving Iran and Iran-Contra. I felt that those motivations were purely political. There were those in my party, principally in my party, who pushed a resolution, and I felt it was unwarranted. If felt it was politically motivated, and voted against it. 
I felt that the independent counsel's Iran-Contra investigation went on way too long. It went on for years and cost an incredible amount of money. 
So I am leery of this general approach because of how it is self-sustaining and goes on indefinitely. The passage of the statute was to try and do something to take politics out of this a bit, to set some very clear guidelines so we would not be involved in partisan debate over whether or not there ought to be an independent counsel. 
Obviously, Members are going to express themselves on the issue, and I understand that. But with the independent counsel law we tried to remove the political debate in deciding these issues. I urge my colleagues in this matter to allow the Attorney General to make her decision. She is about as independent as any Attorney General we have had and certainly has not been intimidated by invoking the independent counsel statute in the past, as expressed by the Senator from Vermont. 
I want to express the worrisome feelings I have about this. We have seen independent counsel investigations go on way too long. They are self-fulfilling. Today, we have the Justice Department, the FBI looking at the matter that is the subject of the request that an independent counsel become involved.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay a special tribute to one of the U.S. Senate's most revered and remarkable Members. I speak of our senior Senator and our friend from Kentucky, Wendell Ford. 
Mr. President, I should note on a personal level I was a law student in Kentucky when Wendell Ford was Governor of the State of Kentucky, and I developed a fondness and affection for him from afar as a student in that State at the University of Louisville many years ago. I had an opportunity to watch this man preside over State government in the State of Kentucky. He did a remarkable job. In those days I never thought, as I was sitting there as a student, that one day I would be serving in the U.S. Senate with him and calling him my colleague and my friend. It is with bittersweet emotions and sensations here that I rise to recognize, as others already have, that Wendell Ford, as we all know, has announced he will not seek reelection in 1998 and will be retiring from the U.S. Senate. 
I say bittersweet because on the one hand I am confident that our friend Wendell Ford and his lovely wife Jean will enjoy some years of retirement, away from the hectic life of public service. So I am glad for him and glad for his wife and for his family. Obviously, on another level, I think all of us would agree, regardless of political persuasion or ideology, that we have come to develop a deep and sincere affection for Wendell Ford. He will be truly missed in this body. 
Just this past Monday, as of course we all know, Senator Ford announced his intention to retire from the U.S. Senate at the end of this term, concluding what I think has been one of the most remarkable and distinguished careers in the history of Kentucky. Wendell Ford served his fellow Kentuckians for the past 30 years, first in the State senate of that State, then in the Governors Mansion, as I have already mentioned, and finally here in the U.S. Senate, where he has been a Member for the past 22 years. By the time he completes his term in 1999, Wendell Ford will be the longest serving U.S. Senator in the history of the State of Kentucky. 
Throughout my tenure as U.S. Senator, it has been my great honor to serve alongside this remarkable man. He has brought integrity and honesty and a wonderful sense of humor to a body that is far too often devoid of such characteristics. Although narrow and snappy sound bites and polished television appearances seem to garner the most attention in Washington, Wendell Ford stands in sharp contrast. As long as I have known him, Wendell Ford never saw a television camera he didn't want to simply walk past. As always, he is more interested in working behind the scenes, crafting legislation, seeking coalitions, seeking compromises. This is the essence of making the Senate function as a body that requires that we get along and work together to seek solutions that Americans look for. 
Certainly Wendell Ford is capable of being outspoken and passionate and as resolute as any Member of this body, but he has also understood there is a time for politics and a time for legislating and the two shall rarely intertwine, in his view. Throughout his career, he remained true to the people and places of his beloved Kentucky. Few Senators fought harder for their States than Wendell has. As a Member of the subcommittee on aviation issues, he helped bring two international airports to Louisville and northern Kentucky. During the debate in the last Congress on the telecommunications bill, Senator Ford sought to ensure that the interests of rural communities all across America, such as those in his home State, would receive the attention that they deserve. On a national level as well, he has been a leader in aviation, energy, campaign finance issues, and his efforts have been instrumental in expanding airport improvement programs and other critical civil and Federal aviation issues. 
As chairman of the Joint Committee on Printing, Senator Ford has helped cut millions of dollars in Government printing costs. 
What is more, he has spearheaded greater use of recycled paper by the Federal Government. These issues don't always get as much attention as they should, but certainly, as all of us appreciate as we try to reduce the cost of Federal Government to make it more efficient, things like bringing down the costs of printing, which is voluminous at Federal Government level, and to also see that recycled paper is used, are no small efforts indeed. 
I know the major issue for many Americans, of course, was Wendell Ford's effort to spearhead motor voter registration, which has made it possible for millions of Americans to become enfranchised. He certainly will be remembered for years to come for those efforts as well. 
I know that bill had a special significance for Wendell Ford because it gave him a chance to appear on MTV's Rock The Vote. Wendell Ford is certainly an MTV kind of Senator. As most of us would appreciate, I say that with a sense of humor, to all who know and love him. 
Most of all, I think Wendell Ford has brought a sense of quiet dignity and forthrightness to this Chamber. Always, he kept his word, never betrayed a confidence, and I doubt there is a Member of this Chamber who will not miss his presence. 
It is worth noting, the other day an editorial in the Lexington Herald-Leader, I think, summed up the feelings all of us would have with the announcement that Wendell Ford will not be with us at the end of this Congress. Let me quote that editorial. It said: 
We have known people who have disagreed with Wendell Ford. We have seen people get mad at Wendell Ford. We have even heard of people who wish Wendell Ford would finally lose an election. We have never heard of anyone, however, who doesn't like the senior Senator from Kentucky. 
Certainly if that is true in the State of Kentucky, it is true in the U.S. Senate as well. We will miss him and we wish him and his wife, Jean, the very best in the years to come.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in his recent announcement that our friend from Kentucky, Wendell Ford, will retire at the end of the term, he said something very instructive and most of us may recall it. It was only a few days ago. Those who love and know the Senator knows he never fails to be instructive in his uniquely witty way. The Senator from Kentucky said one major reason he was not running again was because he did not want to spend the next 2 years raising $100,000 a week. Those were his words, $100,000 a week to raise the necessary dollars to run for reelection in Kentucky. 
With that statement, Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky captured, I think, with crystal clarity, the essence of this debate over campaign finance reform. I think most of us would agree there is just too much money in our political system, and it takes far too much money for the average American to be a part of the political system. So I rise this afternoon to speak about campaign finance reform and what I believe we must do to fix our campaign finance system. 
As my colleagues know, I just completed a 2-year term as the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee. I did not ask for that job, but, nonetheless, I am very proud to have been asked to serve in that capacity, an honor bestowed on two other Members in recent years. The former majority leader, Bob Dole, served as general chairman of the Republican National Committee, and Paul Laxalt served as general chairman of the Republican National Committee. 
My tenure as general chairman brings a unique perspective to campaign finance reform. I wish to speak briefly about the Hollings campaign finance reform constitutional amendment and the McCain-Feingold finance reform bill that is pending before this body. 
I will also, as I said earlier, speak about the role of the Federal Election Commission in our campaign finance system and will introduce a bill shortly that I think will strengthen the FEC and enable it to do the job with which it has been charged by the U.S. Congress. 
Mr. President, we have been speaking over the last few days about amending the Constitution, and, like most of my colleagues, I am extraordinarily wary of constitutional amendments. I believe, as I think most do, that our Constitution is a sacred organic document that has guided our lawmakers and this Nation and protected our rights successfully, by and large, for the past 200 years. 
The citizens of this Nation have found it necessary to amend the Constitution only 27 times in over 200 years, 17 times since the Bill of Rights was written, and they have been wise, I think, in that restraint. But more than 20 years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in what I believe to be a flawed decision by that Court, the Buckley versus Valeo decision, that very simply, money equals political speech. 
I have never quite seen the logic in that decision. I believe that the poor woman next door who can only make a very small or no contribution at all has just as much right to be heard as someone who can make a sizable contribution, and, yet, obviously the voices have different weight. So I do not believe we ought to necessarily assume because people can or cannot make a contribution that their voices are going to be heard with the same volume and intensity. 
I am not alone in this assessment that the Buckley decision is flawed. Fifty prominent constitutional scholars led by Ronald Dworkin, and 24 attorneys general, believe the Buckley decision was simply wrong. 
So, while money floods endlessly in our election system, the voice of the average American too often is drowned out. My fear is democracy will be the victim. I repeat, I am extremely wary of amending the Constitution, much less the first amendment, but I 
have come to the conclusion that there is simply too much money in the system and that our campaign finance troubles are so great that I think an amendment is warranted in this case. Therefore, I am lending my name as a cosponsor and will be supporting the constitutional amendment when it comes for a vote before this body. 
But I think we must also be realistic. The fact is that this amendment is going to fail. There are not enough votes to carry it. I know that, and I think the Senator from South Carolina does as well. The process of passing this amendment would be a long and arduous one, if it is ever passed, and I understand that as well. 
We simply cannot, however, let our democracy languish, in my view, in the current campaign finance system any longer, much less until we are able to pass a constitutional amendment, which makes clear everyone has a right to be heard regardless of how much money they have, how deep their pockets are. That is why I am a strong supporter of the McCain-Feingold legislation that has been the subject of much discussion over the past several months. 
One of the McCain-Feingold's great advantages is that it is written with the Supreme Court's Buckley versus Valeo decision, in mind. Trying to avoid the assertions that have been made by many, and I believe with good reason, they are concerned whether or not this bill would actually pass constitutional muster. But I think Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have gone out of their way to try and craft this bill in such a way as to answer those concerns that have been raised by legitimate scholars of the Constitution and legitimate scholars of the Buckley versus Valeo decision. 
The bill acknowledges, as I am sure the Presiding Officer knows, the constitutional constraints laid out in Buckley, and it tries to fashion a workable solution to most of our campaign finance problems, including the soft money issue, within those constraints. 
Since the opening gavel of the 105th Congress, the Senate and the House, and much of Washington--of course the media--have spent countless hours discussing the fundraising practices that have been raised during the 1996 elections. Finally, a couple of days ago, the Senate finalized the budget and scope of the investigation into most of these alleged improprieties. 
It will be an investigation that will examine aspects of both Presidential and congressional elections, performed with a reasonable amount of money, in my view, and within a reasonable amount of time. 
Mr. President, you may recall, and others may recall, that I abstained during those votes. I did so not because I did not support the investigation. On the contrary, I do support the investigation. I think it is necessary. Rather, as I explained before the Rules Committee last week, I did abstain in order to avoid any question about the motives that I might have in casting votes on various matters that could have come up. 
As it turned out, we had only a couple of votes, and they were carried unanimously in this Chamber. I could not have anticipated that, given the division during the consideration of the resolution in the Rules Committee and prior to the consideration of it when it came to the floor of the Senate. I did not want my motives to be impugned or second-guessed and decided, having served as the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, I would abstain on the votes affecting that investigation and that committee's work. 
I am glad, as I said earlier, that an agreement has been reached unanimously, and I hope it will get us to the bottom of all of the alleged misdeeds that have been raised by everyone in this process, Republicans, Democrats, and others. 
That said, I think it is clear that while Americans want us to find out what happened in 1996, it is just as clear that they are also asking us to fix a system that led to the alleged problems that occurred in 1996. Indeed, Americans have been urging us for quite some time to fix our campaign finance system, and I do not think we need to wait much longer or go through lengthy hearings to analyze the various proposals and ideas that have been suggested. 
We need not wait for an investigation. We do not have to wait for the conclusion of a debate on a constitutional amendment. The McCain-Feingold legislation, I think, is the way we can do that, and I believe we should do it now. Indeed, the questions raised during the last election about campaign finance spending serve, I think, to highlight the critical importance of the need for immediate legislative action. 
Over the past 10 years, Mr. President, this Congress has spent a great deal of time looking at our campaign finance laws. Let me share with you a litany of how much we have accumulated in terms of testimony and ideas that have come forward. 
The Congress has produced in 10 years 6,742 pages of congressional hearings on campaign finance reform. There have been 3,361 speeches that have been given on the floor of this body on campaign finance reform. There has been over 1,000 pages of committee reports on campaign finance reform. There have been 113 votes in the U.S. Senate on campaign finance reform. We have heard from 522 witnesses before the U.S. Senate on campaign finance reform. And we have had one bipartisan commission established to examine campaign finance reform and make suggestions. And yet, at the conclusion of all of that, Mr. President, we are no better off today than we were 10 years ago on this issue. 
So while I am certain there will be additional hearings this year, I would urge those who may be interested in examining various ideas--I am quite confident the bulk of the speech and documents and hearings and testimony already accumulated, the amount of evidence, I think, would provide us with the basis for crafting legislation and answering the questions that have been raised. 
Survey after survey of Americans in this country indicates that people believe our campaign system is in desperate need of reform. What is worse, the same surveys indicate that the American people's lack of faith in the campaign system is translating itself--this may be the most serious problem aside from the issue of campaign contributions and donations--the most serious problem may not be that, as bad as that is, but the lack of faith, the declining level of faith that the American people have in our democratic institutions. For that is at the very heart of what is at stake here. 
Some of our colleagues who oppose reform have said we need more, not less, money in politics. Well, Mr. President, we have gotten more. There is no question about it--a fourfold increase in campaign finance donations in just the past 8 years, from $220 million raised by both parties in 1988, to $881 million raised in 1996, a 73-percent increase over 4 years ago--a 73-percent increase in political costs since 1992. While wages rose 13 percent and education costs rose 17 percent during that same period of time, the cost and expenditures of campaigns rose 73 percent. 
And what has all that money done? How has it paid off? One might assume, well, if we spent more money and more people are involved today, more people are participating, maybe it is worth it. That assumption is clearly wrong. 
Last November, Mr. President, only 49 percent of the eligible population in the United States of America bothered to vote in a Presidential election. That is the lowest turnout since the 1920's, more than 70 years ago. So while the dollar volume has increased, the amount of ads have risen, and proliferation about people's points of view have certainly grown tremendously, we are watching an inverse reaction and fewer and fewer people seem to be participating in the process. 
While there is a great deal of attention, obviously, in the media and here on Capitol Hill on the Democratic Party's efforts to raise campaign funds, I think it is important that we try to put this issue in perspective. 
First of all, let me say at the outset, Mr. President, I think that my party, the Democratic Party, made a huge error in 1993 when President Clinton was inaugurated into office. The Democrats were in the majority in the U.S. Senate. We were in the majority in the House of Representatives. We should have passed, in my view, campaign finance reform, and we did not. I think those who wish to take us to task on that issue are right in doing so. We made a mistake. And we missed an opportunity. 
Having said that, Mr. President, the mistake should not be compounded, in my view, by letting the succeeding Congresses go on without trying to come to terms with this issue. And if nothing else comes out of the great attention to what happened in 1996, 
then maybe, just maybe, that as a result of the attention being paid to what happened, we might finally get an opportunity here to come together and pass some meaningful campaign finance reform. 
But, Mr. President, I cannot resist in pointing out as well that when it comes to the question of dollars raised in these efforts, of course, in the last cycle our friends on the Republican side raised $549 million compared to the $332 million raised by the Democratic Party. 
Second, of course, Democrats have long supported reform. Many Republicans do as well. In fact, the lead cosponsor of the bill that I mentioned earlier, the McCain-Feingold, is a Republican. For those who may not be familiar with our colleague from Arizona, John McCain is a Republican, and Russ Feingold is a Democrat from Wisconsin. And yet despite that, in the previous Congress we had 46 out of 47 Democrats support John McCain's bill along with Russ Feingold. But it failed to muster the necessary votes to break a filibuster. 
We had a majority of people here that were willing to at least bring the McCain-Feingold bill to the floor, but you need, of course, a supermajority to break a filibuster. We never could produce the supermajority even to bring the bill up so the people could offer their ideas and suggestions on how they might modify or amend the McCain-Feingold proposal. 
Mr. President, I have been involved in these issues for some time, going back to 1979 when some of the first proposals were offered on limiting political action committees. I count about 6 proposals that have come up in the past 10 years or so, mostly in the mid-1980's, which I supported and was anxious to see come to a vote. 
I am a cosponsor of the McCain-Feingold bill and was when it was first introduced in 1995. 
Let me quickly say about the McCain-Feingold bill, Mr. President, this is hardly what I would call a perfect piece of legislation. I have never seen one of those anyway, and this certainly does not fall into that category either. And there are areas, clearly, where I think some changes may be necessary. 
But, in my view, Mr. President, it represents the best place to begin. If our standard is going to be that we will not bring up legislation unless it is perfect, then we would never bring up any legislation. And so, McCain-Feingold, I think, ought to be the proper vehicle. It is the one that has garnered the most attention and support, and, as I said earlier, it does try to track very carefully the concerns that were raised by the Buckley versus Valeo decision. 
It is clear, I think, if we were truly and effectively to clean up our campaigns, we must provide the appropriate agency, however, with the tools to do so. 
Mr. President, we must give, in my view, the Federal Election Commission the power to promptly and effectively enforce the laws. It has been suggested that we do not need new laws; we just need to make the present ones work. There is some legitimacy in that. It is not entirely wrong. 
We need also, I argue, to be able to enforce the laws that today prohibit certain activities. But I think one thing that was said over and over again last fall and this winter is, the very agency we created and charged with being the cop on the beat when it comes to campaign finance reform is basically a toothless tiger. We created an agency and then deprived it of the tools and the resources necessary to do the very policing that ought to be done to help try and avoid some of the problems that some have suggested have occurred, in this past campaign. 
Over the past few years, the sheer number of cases, Mr. President, that the FEC has dealt with is growing, and the growing complexity of campaign laws and a series of counterproductive court cases are making it increasingly difficult for the Federal Election Commission to fulfill, in my view, its watchdog role in a timely and effective manner. 
I sat through the testimony of the FEC before the Rules 
Committee a few weeks ago, Mr. President. I was shocked to learn, for instance, the tremendous backlog in the caseload at the Federal Election Commission and the sharp increase in the activity that the Federal Election Commission has been asked to oversee. 
At the end of December, the FEC had a total caseload of 361 cases. Because of reductions in staff, only 112 of those cases are active, compared to 160 active cases in 1995. 
And the case filed in October, I might point out, by the Democratic National Committee, in which the Democratic National Committee asked the FEC to investigate its campaign fundraising in the 1996 elections--I might point out, even before the election had occurred--I discovered has not even begun yet. Here we are in the middle of March, and a request was made in October to look at allegations involving the Democratic National Committee has not even begun. That was prior to the election, and they have not even begun to look at the issues because they lack enough staff to do so. 
Here is the body and the organization, the agency, as I said earlier, that is the cop on the beat, and they have not even begun to look at the questions that were raised last fall. 
Add to that heavy 1996 workload of regular cases, Mr. President: In 1996, the FEC was asked to examine 33 percent more complaints than it did in 1994. 
Congressional spending in 1996 general elections was $626.4 million--just the congressional elections here--$626.4 million. That was an increase of about 7 percent since 1994 levels, 2 years earlier. It was the FEC that had to oversee this spending. 
And an unprecedented $2.5 billion in financial activity was reported to the Commission in 1996. 
In my view, Mr. President, a restructuring and strengthening of the Federal Election Commission is long overdue. That is why today, Mr. President, I will be introducing Federal Election Commission improvement legislation. 
I have not written an aggressive or radical proposal to overhaul the FEC. Rather, this bill stands as a modest effort to give the FEC the resources and the authority it needs to properly enforce our campaign finance laws. 
Because, Mr. President, I so strongly support the FEC improvement provisions in the McCain-Feingold bill, the proposed legislation I will offer shortly simply repeats them. I also add a few other provisions of my own. 
I have heard numerous colleagues say over and over again, campaign finance reform is not the issue in 1997. 
It is the illegalities of 1996 that many say must be the issue. Yet, at the same time as they make that assertion, we hear that they are against funding and providing the authority to the very agency that should be the first one to uncover and punish any wrongdoing. 
If we are serious about enforcing the law, Mr. President, then the bill I introduce today deserves serious and, I hope, favorable consideration by my colleagues. The Federal Election Commission has been called a toothless tiger, and it is; an ineffectual agency, and it is; a monument to congressional paralysis, and it is. It is time to change it. 
My bill authorizes full funding for the FEC, including a $1.7 million supplemental fiscal year 1997 appropriation to enable the Commission to handle this increased workload that I have enumerated. 
And to satisfy our friends who have said that we must try and get as much reporting and disclosure as soon as possible, this legislation also requires electronic filing. Increased disclosure is the magic elixir, some have suggested, so by mandating electronic filing at the Federal Election Commission for all Federal candidates' reports, we would ensure that disclosure reports are available in a timely fashion. Too often the reports become available weeks and months after the election is all over with. Electronic filing would allow you to know instantaneously exactly where the campaign contributions are coming from prior to an election, on a timely basis during a campaign. Today the technology exists to do it. This legislation would require, mandate, electronic filing by all candidates for Federal office. 
Furthermore, the legislation would allow the FEC to establish standard fines for minor reporting violations and conduct random campaign audits. That had been stopped and prohibited. Nothing, I think, would have a more salutary effect on campaigns than to know that you could be the subject of a random audit at any time. This, I think, would help strengthen the FEC's ability to report to the Congress on the kinds of practices that ought to give us concern, and possibly the subject of further reform. 
I think we must acknowledge, Mr. President, that the Federal Elections Commission was charged with the responsibility of enforcing our election laws, and that part of the reason our election system is so out of control is that Congress, in my view, has refused over the years to provide the FEC with the ability and the tools to carry out the duties that we have charged them with performing. 
As we rush to establish Federal investigations into election law violations, let us not forget we do have an Agency balanced with Democrats and Republicans that is charged with the very responsibility we have just taken upon ourselves. 
In my view, Mr. President, the FEC must be given the ability to do its job, and that is the goal of the legislation I will be proposing. 
I conclude, Mr. President, by adding that genuine campaign finance reform will not occur it we do not elevate the issue above partisanship. It is not a Democratic or Republican issue. As I mentioned earlier before the Presiding Officer arrived in the Chamber, I think the Democrats made a huge error in 1993 and 1994 when we had an opportunity to do something about campaign finance reform. The Presiding Officer was a Member of the House of Representatives in those years, and so we are properly criticized, in my view, for not acting. 
Having said that, I do not think we need to necessarily perpetuate that by not stepping forward in these coming weeks and try to take steps to strengthen the FEC, pass McCain-Feingold with whatever amendments people want to offer, and try to provide some framework. I think there are issues which we will find great unanimity of support, given the chance for expression here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, obviously while going forward with the investigation, and to allow the Justice Department and others to do the work, of course, which they are charged with doing. All of these efforts, if done properly and well, I think, can at the end 
of the day, provide us with a different system than we presently have. 
So the future Wendell Fords of this body who, when they consider whether or not they ought to seek reelection, as he announced in his statement, would not look at the prospect in March, as many as 18, 20 months before election day, of raising, as he felt he would have to do, $100,000 a week for 80 weeks in order to be a viable candidate for a State the size of Kentucky--not to mention, of course what it costs in other States like my colleague from Pennsylvania, or California, New York, Florida, Illinois, or Ohio. In large States with huge populations, these numbers become astronomical. If it is going to take that on the part of individual candidates, then, I think, obviously the results speak for themselves. 
I appreciate the opportunity to address this issue. I am going to send to the desk and ask that this bill be reported to the appropriate committee to strengthen the Federal Election Committee so it can do its job. I thank the Presiding Officer and my colleague from Pennsylvania.

Mr. DODD. I made the point last October when the allegations arose about the Democratic National Committee, Don Fowler, who is the chair of the DNC, and myself, asked the FEC to immediately conduct an investigation into these allegations. 
The FEC came before the Rules Committee a couple of weeks ago to present its budget, as they do on an annual basis. I asked them how the investigation was going. This was now March. I was stunned to have them report they have not even begun to look at this. 
So here is a request made 6 months ago on, obviously, a very serious matter, and they have not even begun to work on it. The reason, they say, is the caseload is backed up so much on them and there has been a reduction in their staff allocations. Now, obviously, more probing about that may be necessary.

Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague, Mr. President, for his observations. I do not think I asked that question because I think I was so stunned by the response, I assumed things were moving along. I do not know how they determine--of course, it is a bipartisan Commission--how they determine what basis they look at matters, but I do not disagree. 
My colleague has been generous in his comments.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished Senator from New Mexico and a bipartisan group of my colleagues in co-sponsoring this Senate resolution designating October 19-25 as `National Character Counts Week.' 
This morning, like every morning before it and every morning to come, young Americans are headed off to learn their three `R's'--reading, writing, and arithmetic--in our Nation's schools. But as we all know, the school day involves more than just the transmission of facts or the relaying of concepts. It's also about character. In the best classrooms in America our children are given the opportunity to learn and practice basic character traits such as sharing, cooperation, and respect. 
The Character Counts initiative calls on all Americans to embrace the development of six attributes--trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship--as a fundamental aspect of our children's education and as a critically important means of strengthening our Nation. The lessons our young people learn as children are the ones that will stay with them the rest of their lives. As Eleanor Roosevelt once said: `Character building begins in our infancy, and continues until death.' 
We live in a time when teenage pregnancy and juvenile crime are spiraling out of control. A recent poll suggests that two-thirds of Americans believe most people can't be trusted, half say most people would cheat others if they could and in the end are only looking out for themselves. These statistics and the seeming erosion in the basic norms of civility, even among our Nation's children, are ample evidence of the need for programs that promote character development. 
No one would argue that Character Counts is a panacea for these complex problems. First and foremost, we need better education, stronger families, and healthy doses of individual responsibility. 
Clearly the primary obligation for the building of our children's values and belief systems lies with our Nation's families. There is only so much government can and should do. But, with parents being forced to spend more and more time out of the house, our Nation's schools can and should do everything they can to work with parents in helping to build character among America's children. 
There is nothing inappropriate or heavyhanded about teaching character in our schools. These programs don't impose morality or any one group's world view. These programs teach honesty, courage, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and loyalty, attributes that I believe all Americans agree upon. 
These principles transcend religion, race, philosophy, and even political affiliation. For those Americans who share the goal of energizing our democracy and strengthening our Nation's character these initiatives are simply common sense. 
What's more, these programs garner tangible benefits. In Connecticut, the Southwest Elementary School in Torrington implemented a character education program in September of last year and has witnessed positive effects as a result of its efforts. Attendance is up, students are more respectful toward their teachers, and school administrators are convinced that Character Counts is responsible. The school engages parents in the effort, who along with educators and the students themselves, love the program. 
Additionally, this year in Connecticut, the Leadership Committee of Character Counts will undertake a comprehensive training program to qualify 35 instructors to educate students about the importance of strength of character. These instructors will bring the ideals stressed by Character Counts directly to the students of Connecticut, reaching 100,000 students by year's end. While character education may not be a magical solution to all of America's problems, it represents a positive effort to make a real difference in our children's lives. Character development programs for our children strengthen our lives, our communities, and our Nation as a whole. 
I commend my friend and colleague from New Mexico for all of his work in this area. And I invite all my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join us in supporting character education as a vital means of molding better individuals, strengthening families, and creating a responsible American citizenry.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise here this morning to introduce a piece of legislation which I have entitled the Better Financial Aid for Working Students Act of 1997. At the appropriate time here, Mr. President, I will send the bill to the desk and ask that it be referred to the appropriate committee. But let me take a few minutes, if I can, to explain what I am trying to do with this proposal. 
This legislation is designed, Mr. President, to assist America's working students to cope with the growing financial burdens of a college education. One hardly even needs to use the words `growing financial burden.' It is to state the obvious. 
There is not a family in America that does not have children in school or going on to college or who have already been there that does not appreciate what a significant burden the cost of a higher education is in our country. 
For the parents of college-aged children, of course, this is a trying time of year, not only for the parents, but for those who are anticipating going on to higher education. These parents and students are today anxiously awaiting the acceptance letters or rejection letters from our Nation's colleges and universities around the country. 
However, for the vast majority of families, beyond waiting for an acceptance or rejection letter in March and April from institutions they have applied to, the biggest concern is not whether they are going to get into college or into a community college or into a university; the biggest question, the biggest challenge facing these families is: How are we going to pay for this? If they get in, how are we possibly going to finance this incredible burden that we see increasing all the time? 
In fact, Mr. President, I think this week or maybe the past week one of our national magazines--I believe it was Time magazine--has a special issue out on the cost of higher education. It is their cover story. I commend them for it. I believe it was Time, I apologize if it was another periodical. But it is at an appropriate point with these acceptance and rejection letters coming to seniors in high school and others who have been out of school for some time but anxious to get back in. 
So I am stating again the obvious. This is a time of some anxiety. But I would argue, the greatest anxiety is not `whether or not I'm going to be able to go on to a higher educational opportunity,' but rather, `How am I possibly going to afford this? How are we going to afford this so our children or myself will be able to acquire the skills and educational levels that are going to be necessary for us to succeed or for my children to succeed in the future?' 
That is why the letter they await, Mr. President, with the most anxiety, of course, is the financial aid letter. Working families understand as well as anyone that a college education has never been more important than it is today. 
Thirty years ago, Mr. President, a high school diploma could get you a good job, not the best job, but you would get a good job. You could raise a family. You could buy a home. You could have a good life, retire with a decent level of financial security. 
I suspect that the Presiding Officer, his family, my family, certainly we saw that in case after case in our communities, whether it was Arkansas or Connecticut. Today, both of us understand that whether it is Arkansas or Connecticut, that is just not the case any longer. 
Even though you need a high school diploma today, you have to have even more education if you are going to fit into the economy of the 21st century. Presently, the mean income of a high school graduate in the United States is $18,700 a year; that's the mean income. That would be barely enough to sustain a working family. In fact, if you have a family of four, $18,700 just doesn't do it today; I don't care where you live in the United States. But with a bachelor's degree, earnings nearly double, to $32,600 a year. So that additional 4 years can make a fantastic and huge difference in an individual's ability to provide for themselves and their families. 
As you might anticipate, Mr. President, the higher the education, the greater the financial benefits. On average, a holder of a professional degree earns more than $74,500 a year. But making the college opportunity a reality for our children, and for those adults who are going on to higher education, is important beyond simply individual earnings. That is obviously a benefit. But beyond the dollars and cents, beyond the ability of individuals to earn a higher salary, there are benefits to the economy as a whole. According to a new Wall Street Journal survey, Mr. President, two-thirds of academic economists agree that the right Government policies in education would provide a needed shot in the arm to the American economy. The fact is, in today's global economy, higher education is vital if we are to maintain our international competitiveness and to keep our economy strong. 
Since the passage of the GI bill, Mr. President--which millions of Americans are familiar with--there may be those who are retired today who remember, after coming out of World War II or the Korean conflict, what a difference the GI bill meant to them. There was a significant debate that many may recall about whether or not we could afford to pay for the GI bill. 
I think in today's dollars, Mr. President, the GI bill--if we tried to adopt something like it today, in 1997--would amount to about $9,000 for every single student who took advantage of it. Obviously, the bulk of them took advantage of it in the late forties and fifties, the generation that came out of World War II and Korea. But can you imagine that, today, if you and I were to stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate and be advocates for something like $9,000 for every eligible person who wanted to go on to a higher education? There is no way in the world we could pass anything like that--not to mention finding the resources to pay for it. 
So it was a remarkable accomplishment, with all the debt we had at the end of World War II and Korea that hadn't been paid off at that particular time. There was a collective understanding of the value to the country beyond the individual benefit of having a generation that could never, ever have thought about affording a higher education. We, as a country, at the national level, said, let's see if we can't come up and find some resources to help these people who could not afford to go on to school, so they have the resources to do it. I think it is fascinating to note the analysis of how that has worked out. There was an analysis not long ago, Mr. President, that said that, for every dollar spent on the GI bill, the Nation reaped a benefit of $7 in additional revenues--a 7-to-1 ratio. So as expensive as it was, our country as a whole benefited tremendously beyond the obvious individual benefits that those men--primarily men, but men and women--who were recipients of the GI bill received. The country as a whole was a tremendous beneficiary of that program. 
At any rate, from this very first effort in higher education--on to policies today--the hallmark of the Federal Government's role in education is not to set aside the curricula in our higher education institutions, or be involved in the workings of these 
institutions; our role is to try and come up with creative ways to help students and families afford the financial burden of a higher education. 
Today, Mr. President, student assistance is determined by a complicated analysis of family and student assets and earnings. I am destined to make my colleagues' eyes glaze over if I try to explain it on the Senate floor, but suffice it to say, it is a rather significant morass of various loans, grants, and other forms of assistance. However, what must remain crystal clear is that, for millions of Americans, college is not simply a time of tranquil learning and weekend parties or weekend gatherings on campuses. For many college students today, Mr. President--if not most--full and part-time work is a fundamental part of their college education. 
This bill that I am introducing this morning would help protect these students and ensure that when considering students' financial needs, work is rewarding. Today, Mr. President, under current law, $1,750 of a student's earning from work is shielded when determining need for financial aid. Beyond that initial $1,750, students' earnings are assessed at a rate of 50 percent. 
The proposal I have for us to consider would double that amount, from $1,750 to $3,500, which we would shield, so those students would not have to allocate 50 percent of every dollar over $1,750 to their higher education. It would establish a graduated assessment, from $3,500 to $5,000, which would be assessed at 35 percent, and anything over $5,000 in earnings would be assessed at the 50 percent that today is assessed at $1,750. I don't know exactly when, Mr. President, the $1,750 was set aside. It may have been when the number of students that were actually working to pay for their education was relatively small and that work may have been something that people did to acquire some independent financial means to take care of their daily needs. 
But as I would say again, no matter where you live in the country, most of our students today are on loans and are out working. College isn't a 4-year deal where you go straight through anymore. You have to have some work experience. This would allow them--since many are paying their own rent, buying their own food, paying for their own transportation--by raising the $1,750 to $3,500, graduated up to $5,000, this would allow them to retain more of that income that they need for their legitimate expenses, before assessing it at a high level that would deprive them of that ability. 
Again, this is not going to be a panacea for everything students need, but I think it is realistic. We are going to consider major reforms in the Higher Education Act. I anticipate and hope that this bill might be a part of that proposal. This legislation would ensure that the efforts of these families will be rewarded; work would be rewarded and encouraged. However, this effort should not stand alone, Mr. President. Clearly, there are other groups who may require changes, and other groups of legislation that may require changes. Specifically, I think we need to be sure that single students--particularly those with children--are not penalized because they are forced to work in order to pay for their education. 
The bill I am introducing today is, I think, an important first step. In my view, it will guarantee that low-income students receive the financial aid they so urgently need. I look forward to working on this legislation with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle here. I put it out for people's consideration. They may have some ideas to moderate it one way or another. 
Again, I think that given the common interest and common concern about higher education and how we can at least lighten the burdens of those out there trying to get that education and also holding down jobs, I encourage my colleagues' attention to this proposal. 
With that, I send the bill to the desk and ask that it be referred to the appropriate committee.

Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for yielding. I wanted to make some of the same points. I see my colleague from California here as well. 
There has been a lot of discussion about budgets, Mr. President. There has been an additional request now that the President submit yet another budget. Let me just suggest that I think the reception of the President's budget was, initially, encouraging. Our Republican colleagues can be commended for not declaring it `dead on arrival,' as we have seen all too often in past budgets. But as has been pointed out, year in and year out there is a dual responsibility not only for the executive branch to submit budgets, but also for those of us in the coequal branch of Government, the legislative branch of Government, which has control over the purse strings, to respond. We must respond in a way that gives the American public an opportunity, one, to either endorse what the President has suggested or, two, to offer alternatives that can be identified and seen so comparisons can be made. 
I hope at this juncture the majority here would demonstrate leadership. The Budget Act requires that budgets be sent to the full Congress; that we then submit a budget, have our own budget here, that either duplicates the President or offers some alternatives so that we can then debate out the process and move in the direction that I think all of us have endorsed regardless of where anyone stood on the proposed constitutional amendment. 
I didn't hear a single Member of this body indicate anything but strong support for achieving a balanced budget as soon as possible, hopefully by the year 2002, for all of the very obvious reasons that the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and others articulated during that lengthy debate. Our colleague from Illinois has already pointed out--and these charts here, I think, give some indication of what we are looking at--the tax breaks that are being proposed. They are actually even larger than last year's proposals. 
There are Members who endorse last year's proposals and I presume are in favor of having even larger ones. But I think the American public ought to know what the implications are. As it is right now, over the next 5 years we will be looking, here, at additional tax breaks that are relatively large even over the first 5 years, but then move up considerably over a 10-year period. That ought to be a concern to everyone here. Because, obviously, if we find ourselves again in a deficit situation, even a larger one than we were in the past 10 years, then we will be right back again debating, I presume, constitutional amendments and the like. So we have an obligation to be fiscally responsible.

Mr. DODD. My colleague is absolutely correct. They not only say `wait,' but they also ask the basic question that we all have to ask. If I were to stand here before you and suggest spending increases of $200.5 billion in the first 5 years, and spending increases of $525.8 billion over 10 years, the words would not be out of my mouth before one of my colleagues, either on this side or the other side, would ask me the very fundamental question, the steely-eyed question we are all asked to address today of, `Senator, how do you intend to pay for this?' And, if you cannot answer that threshold question, then you have to go back to the drawing boards. 
All we are suggesting here is to put our constituencies and the American public on notice of what we are looking at here, that comparing these numbers over the next 10 years, the requests are even larger than they were before, and that we ought to be asking that question, without getting into the specificity of particular tax proposals here, how do we pay for them so we do not find ourselves in the situation that we have been placed in over the last 10 or 15 years with huge deficits? 
Let me draw my colleagues' attention as well to this next chart which lays it out exactly. These numbers, by the way, are prepared by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax Committee. They are not prepared by some partisan group. This is a nonpartisan analysis, a bipartisan analysis. It says, if you took these tax cuts and carried them out to the year 2007, given the baseline deficits already projected, that you are looking at these huge new deficits. This year it is about $120 billion. But if unchecked and unpaid for, those deficits rise to $348 billion, exceeding by almost $50 billion the high-water mark for deficits in the last year, 4 years ago, of $290 billion. So those deficits continue to climb. By the year 2007, or before, we will be right back in the situation we were before. So, I draw the attention of my colleagues to that because I think it needs to be addressed. 
How do you pay for these? Again, Members can offer their own solutions. But we are not talking about small change here. These 
are huge items. Obviously, if you look at the budget, where are the big ticket items that could pay for those kinds of proposals? It has been suggested that Medicare, Social Security, health, education, training, veterans, agriculture, infrastructure--these are the big ticket items, particularly up in this part of the bracket, the Medicare, Social Security, natural resources, health and education. Those are the larger items--veterans as well. Defense could fall into this area, obviously. So we ought to be addressing those issues that are before us. 
So we raise this today because we think it is important that we engage in this debate. We are a legislative body. It is deliberate, it is slow, it can be ponderous. But we are trying to prepare, now, a budget, in the wake of the proposed constitutional amendment to try to get us into balance, to keep those interest rates down so businesses can grow and expand and hire people. We have enjoyed 6 years of sustained economic growth now, in no small measure because we collectively have made progress. And I will not engage in the finger-pointing about who deserves credit or who is responsible--but the fact of the matter is, we have brought those deficits down, now, from $290 billion to $120 billion, actually down to $107 billion at one point. And we ought to be doing everything in our power to see to it we continue on that glidepath so those interest rates do not spike up again, costing American families and this Nation the burdens those increases would bring. 
So we are suggesting here today, let us begin work on these. Making a request of the President on a daily basis or hourly basis, `submit yet another budget, yet another budget, yet another budget' is not productive. We bear the responsibility as legislators, those who control the purse strings, to respond to the budget the President has sent to us, either by rejecting it and submitting our own, or by proposing, in a clear way for the American public to see, exactly what the priorities will be and how you will pay for them. 
Whether it is a spending increase or a tax expenditure, the American public wants to know the simple answer to the question: How do you intend to pay for this? So we are here today to urge our colleagues, who are in the position to most specifically respond to these matters, that in the coming days, rather than spending time by issuing press releases challenging the President to submit yet another budget, to fulfill our constitutional obligations here and to step forward and explain to the American public exactly what our proposals are. 
Let me just conclude by saying there are a number of these tax cut proposals that are being suggested which I support. I am not opposed to them. Just as there are spending proposals of which I am in favor. But whether it is a spending proposal I am in favor of or a tax cut I am in favor of, the same question must be asked of either point: How do you pay for them? 
So, whether it is capital gains tax cuts, estate tax cuts, or child care credits--there are all sorts of things people are proposing. Whatever it is, what the bulk of it is, the question must be raised: How do you pay for it? If, in fact, these tax cut proposals, as some have suggested, would drive us back into the very situation we found ourselves in only a few short years ago, then I think we have to meet our responsibility, that has not yet been met, of following our legislative mandates and responsibilities. 
With that, I see my colleague from California here. I will leave these charts here for her to peruse, and for others who may want to come over and take a look at them. I know she shares similar concerns and thoughts, coming from the largest State in our Union, a State which has contributed much to the general welfare and health of our country. Obviously, whether you live in a small State like mine, Connecticut, or a large State like California, people on the respective coasts and everyone in between in this country want to know the answers to these questions. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. Let me begin my brief remarks by commending our colleague from New Mexico for, once again, taking leadership on a significant health issue. I have had the privilege, Mr. President, of working with my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, on numerous issues, most recently things like frivolous lawsuits and mental health. I am delighted to join him as a principal cosponsor of this proposal of the Genetic Confidentiality and Nondiscrimination Act of 1997. 
Mr. President, this legislation is critically important. It deals with basic concerns that people have today. It is of critical importance to our country, important to individuals and to researchers. We are not claiming here this is perfect, but the kind of work that Senator Domenici has done already, in communication with those who would be most directly interested in the legislation, I think has taken us a long way. 
We are fortunate, Mr. President, to live in an extraordinary--an extraordinary--crossroads in the history of our Nation and, indeed, of our species. I can only compare it, Mr. President, to the dawn of the nuclear age. Then, by the elemental act of splitting an atom, we became able to generate seemingly unlimited energy but, also, as we all know, the ability to destroy all forms of human life. 
Today, Mr. President, we stand at the dawn of the genetic age and once again confront heretofore unknown power over our destiny on this small planet. The recent reports of the cloning of mammals places this power in sharp relief. Within a few short years, Mr. President, the human genome project will decipher the entire human genetic code. The entire genetic human code will be deciphered in our lifetime, providing a blueprint of a human being's most personal and potent information. 
This blueprint, Mr. President, will hopefully allow us to understand and remedy illnesses in all its forms. We are already reaping some of the benefits of this newfound knowledge of our genetic makeup. Genetic testing, as many are already aware, is available for several serious diseases and illnesses, including breast cancer and colon cancer. 
Armed with this genetic information, individuals can take additional steps to safeguard their health. For instance, more frequent screenings and checkups. 
However, Mr. President, it will allow the exploitation of the human frailty to which one might be genetically predisposed, and concerns have been raised about the privacy of this information. Many Americans are concerned that dissemination of this information could lead to job discrimination and difficulty in getting or maintaining health insurance or life insurance. These are important issues. 
Clearly, in this area of increasing medical technology, we must be able to ensure a balance between scientific advancement and the privacy rights of individuals. This bill that my colleague from New Mexico has offered begins that critical process. It requires strict informed consent procedures while allowing genetic scientific research to continue. Specifically, this legislation provides protections against unwarranted disclosure of genetic information to employers and insurance companies. 
Mr. President, I am cosponsoring this legislation because I believe it is important that we address these issues today rather than wait. I know some have voiced concerns about this legislation. We hear them. We recognize this is a complex area of law with many important interests at stake. In fact, Mr. President, we will be having a hearing in the Labor Committee this week on the issue of cloning, to which our colleague from New Mexico will be testifying--not specifically about this bill, but I suspect this bill may be the subject of some dialog in that hearing. 
So we are already beginning to look to try and raise the questions that people, I think, would want us to address, protecting people's privacy rights, so that that information that we are able to glean will not be misused. I think this is an important step in that effort. I commend my colleague from New Mexico. I am delighted to cosponsor his bill.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would provide a measure of tax fairness for more than 1,000 police officers, firefighters, and their families in my home State of Connecticut. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Lieberman. 
This bill clarifies the tax treatment of heart and hypertension benefits awarded to Connecticut's police officers and firefighters prior to 1992. The clarification is necessary because of an error made in the original version of Connecticut's heart and hypertension law. Under that law, Connecticut intended to treat heart and hypertension benefits as workmen's compensation for tax purposes. Unfortunately, because of the language used in the State statute, the heart and hypertension benefits became taxable under a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] in 1991. 
Since the IRS ruling, Connecticut has amended its law. But that change does not help those police officers, firefighters, and their families, who received benefits prior to the amendment. These law-abiding citizens accepted the benefits with the understanding that they were not taxable. Now, as a result of the problem with the State law, and through no fault of their own, they have been charged with back taxes, interest, and penalties by the IRS. This has created serious financial difficulties for a number of families. 
I hope that my colleagues will join with me in remedying this problem. Across this Nation, our firefighters and police officers work hard to protect our homes and businesses. They face incredible danger, and sometimes risk their lives, to help keep our communities safe. The hazards they face make their jobs particularly stressful. They need the security provided by heart and hypertension benefits. They should not have to contend with back taxes and penalties assessed due to an error in State law. 
Under this legislation, which would remove their liability for heart and hypertension benefits for the years affected by the IRS ruling--1989-91, we can treat these public servants and their families more fairly. This bill is narrowly drafted to accomplish that limited purpose and would not affect the tax treatment of heart and hypertension benefits awarded after January 1, 1992. 
Mr. President, my efforts to pass this legislation date back to the 102d Congress. During that Congress, Senator Lieberman and I worked with Representatives Barbara Kennelly and Rosa DeLauro and this bill became a part of the Revenue Act of 1992. Although the Revenue Act was passed by Congress, it was vetoed by President Bush 1 day after he lost the election. We tried again during the 103d Congress, but we were unable to move the bill through the relevant committees. Last year, we hoped to move the bill as part of a broader tax and pension package, but that legislation was also stalled. 
I urge my colleagues to help pass this legislation quickly this year. We must provide relief to the Connecticut police officers, firefighters, and their families, who are facing severe financial hardship even though they have tried to follow the rules. Through no fault of their own, they have been hit with significant back taxes and penalties. We should remedy this problem and help them move on with their lives.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to make clear my feelings on one particular aspect of the debate over the balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
My opposition to Senate Joint Resolution 1 is strongly felt and clearly stated. I simply do not believe that it is appropriate to enshrine a restrictive fiscal policy in our Nation's most sacred text. The balanced budget amendment would seriously inhibit our ability to set prudent fiscal policy and respond to cyclical patterns in economic growth. Moreover, the amendment has serious implications for our foreign policy. 
I am also concerned about the balanced budget amendment's effect on Social Security. The Social Security Program is one of the longest running and most successful programs this country has ever undertaken. It has succeeded in virtually eliminating poverty among our Nation's senior citizens. I yield to no one in my commitment to preserving and protecting it. 
In 1983, when Social Security was faced with changing demographics that threatened its very existence, I supported the reforms that ensured that this vital program would survive to meet the needs of future generations. Today, I am very concerned that the program is threatened by the restrictive provisions of the balanced budget constitutional amendment. If Congress is allowed to count Social Security surpluses when determining if the budget is in balance, this critical safety net for our Nation's seniors could be placed in jeopardy. 
For these reasons, I support efforts to protect the Social Security trust funds. If a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is to be enacted, certainly, it should not be one that endangers the retirement security of American families. This is why I supported the amendment offered by my colleague, Senator Reid, which modified the underlying resolution to state that the Social Security trust funds could not be used to achieve balance. 
But I am afraid I could not support the amendment offered by my colleague Senator Dorgan. This amendment would have also protected Social Security, but, unlike Senator Reid's amendment, it was a substitute amendment, a fully crafted, alternative balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
Mr. President, I have grave concerns about any attempt to amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget. These concerns cannot be satisfied simply by changing one or two components of the legislation, as sincere and as sensible as those changes might be. I find any balanced budget amendment highly problematic, and this is why I have voted against the alternative balanced budget amendment offered by my good friend from North Dakota. 
I am a stalwart defender of Social Security, and I am committed to seeing that it protects future generations as well as it has protected previous ones. But I remain opposed to any amendment that would taint the language of the Constitution and weaken our ability to make prudent policy.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly today about the President's resolution requesting the release of fiscal year 1997 international family planning funding by March 1, 1997, on which the Senate recently deliberated. I am pleased that the President signed House Joint Resolution 36 on February 28, 1997, and that funding for family planning is now available to those overseas who so desperately need such services. 
I supported the President's resolution because I believe we must try to limit overpopulation. The world's population increases by 100 million each year. Overpopulation threatens to exert tremendous social, ecological, medical, and economic hardship on much of the world. Family planning is one of the most effective ways to combat overpopulation and its detrimental results. 
I also supported the President's resolution because family planning is one of the best weapons we have to save the lives of women and their children in developing countries. The longer we delay the funding for family planning, the harder it is to save those lives. 
Let me explain: Family planning enables women to space their births, preserving their health and improving the odds that their children will be born healthy. Delaying the release of family planning funding results in less healthy mothers and children and increased rates of maternal and infant mortality. 
Mr. President, I served in the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic, a developing country. For families living under the conditions that exist in many developing nations, family planning is critical. Without it, mothers have great difficulty spacing their births or limiting the number of children they bear. As a result, they suffer the tremendous physical stress of repeated childbirth, often without the aid of physicians, and sometimes die from the great burden they have placed on their bodies. 
But mothers are not the only ones who suffer in these cases. Their children suffer too. When women have children too close together, the length of time they can nurse each child is cut short. Mothers' milk is the most nourishing food for children during their early years, providing essential nutrients that are often hard to find elsewhere in the food supply available to families in developing nations. Furthermore, children in such families find themselves competing for food with many other siblings, instead of only the few siblings they might have if their mothers had access to family planning. As a result, they suffer from higher incidents of malnutrition. 
And family planning programs have the added benefit of slowing the spread of AIDS by increasing access to appropriate contraceptives. 
Mr. President, the agreement between Congress and the President last year was that fiscal year 1997 international family planning funding could be released by March 1, 1997, if the administration certified that a delay in the release of funds until July 1, 1997 would harm overseas family planning programs and their beneficiaries. Indeed, the administration has issued such findings and documented its case well. Its findings show that a delay in funding would result in serious shortage of contraceptives in at least 60 countries, including 50 million condoms, 500,000 IUD's, and 4.8 million cycles of birth control pills. Additionally, the delay would result in the closure of 17 of 95 overseas programs and higher numbers of maternal and infant deaths. 
Some, Mr. President, have attempted to circumvent last year's agreement by saying that family planning aid increases the number of abortions. On the contrary, by allowing women to prevent pregnancy, family planning reduces the need for and number of abortions. The administration's findings speak to this issue, showing that a delay in funding would result in increased incidents of unintended pregnancies and more abortions and that family planning helps decrease the number of abortions worldwide. Furthermore, UNICEF reported in 1996 that 600,000 women die annually of pregnancy-related causes; 75,000 of those deaths are due to self-induced, unsafe abortion. 
Mr. President, it is clear that international family planning aid helps protect the health and lives of women and children around the world. As we aim to improve the socioeconomic conditions in developing countries, let us recognize that family planning is a help, not a hindrance, that must be sustained.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise with my dear friend and colleague, Senator McCain, to introduce legislation of vital importance to Americans who happen to be blind. Its purpose is simply to restore the Social Security earnings limitation for the blind to the same level as that for America's senior citizens. 
Mr. President, the English poet John Milton once said that `To be blind is not miserable; not to be able to bear blindness, that is miserable.' 
Over the past 20 years, blind Americans have made amazing progress in shouldering those difficult burdens. Today, millions of blind Americans have achieved more independent and rewarding lives for themselves. 
The legislation that we introduce today will ensure that this progress continues by restoring an important work incentive for close to 150,000 blind Americans. This bill would reestablish the identical earnings exemption threshold for blind and senior citizen beneficiaries under the Social Security Act, which had been the law from 1977 until just last year. 
Prior to 1977, blind people were overwhelmingly dependent on disability benefits. What's worse, many of them could not afford to work without risking the loss of the basic security that these benefits provided. 
However, in that year, we raised the earnings exemption for the blind to the same level as retirees--from $500 to $940 a month. That modest step encouraged millions of blind Americans to work by allowing them to keep more of what they earned. 
Unfortunately, last year, when the Congress raised the earnings limit for seniors, it failed to extend the same benefits to the blind. 
The impact of this unfortunate step has been significant. As the law now stands, a senior citizen may earn $13,500 in 1997 and $30,000 by the year 2002 without any reduction of benefits. A blind person, on the other hand, may only earn $12,000 today, and only $14,400 in 2002. While this provides terrific encouragement for seniors to work, it reenshrines into law the disincentive for blind people that existed before 1977. 
There are approximately 1.1 million people in the United States who are blind under the Social Security definition. Of those, 713,000 of the 1.1 million are 65 or older, and they are considered retirees, not blind people. 
But there are roughly 387,000 people who are blind, and under retirement age, who have been adversely affected by the severed link between retirees and the blind. Of the 332,000 blind people who are 20 or older, more than 70 percent are unemployed. We must not make their efforts to find meaningful and rewarding work more difficult. Rather, we should encourage blind Americans in their noble endeavors. Our legislation would do just that by raising the earnings limit and linking it once again to the senior citizens exempt account. 
In closing, Mr. President, allow me to commend Senator McCain for his leadership here. He has once again demonstrated his commitment to ensuring that all Americans have a fair and equal opportunity to enjoy the fruits of their labors and the blessings of our great Nation. I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 220th anniversary of the U.S. Cavalry and the contributions the town of Wethersfield, CT, made to the Revolutionary War effort. 
In my home State of Connecticut, the town of Wethersfield is proud to be recognized as the first home and training ground for the Continental Army's first cavalry regiment, known as Sheldon's Horse, the Second Continental Light Dragoons. In a time when armies were slow moving, the Second Continental Dragoons were unique for their swiftness and daring. The Second Dragoons were composed of mounted and dismounted men able to quickly advance on the enemy's flank. 
By orders of the First Continental Congress and General Washington, the Second Dragoon Regiment was the first cavalry regiment directly organized by the Continental Army. According to the Connecticut Historical Commission, on December 12, 1776, the Continental Congress appointed Elisha Sheldon of Salisbury as lieutenant colonel commandant of a regiment of the Continental Cavalry, the first such unit of the Continental Army. He was ordered to enlist six troops to form his regiment at Wethersfield. Among the first officers chosen by Colonel Sheldon was Wethersfield resident, Maj. Benjamin Tallmadge. In the late winter and early spring of 1977, Major Tallmadge erected a training ground for the training and breaking of horses for the regiment in Wethersfield. 
Under Major Tallmadge's direction and leadership, the Second Regiment fought in the battles of Short Hills, Brandywine, Trenton, Saratoga, and White Plains, and during the harsh winter at Valley Forge, the Dragoons patrolled the area for General Washington. 
Currently, the U.S. Cavalry is based in Fort Riley, KS, but it will be forever linked to the town of Wethersfield and Connecticut. I applaud the efforts of the people of Wethersfield to celebrate their history and the contributions they have made to ensuring the independence of America.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before turning to the subject of my amendment here, let me commend my colleague from Pennsylvania for his comments. I associate myself with his remarks regarding Alexis Herman and the hope expressed by him that a hearing will be held promptly for Alexis Herman. She deserves that hearing. 
I have known Alexis Herman for some time. She is eminently qualified, Mr. President, to fulfill the position of Secretary of Labor. There have been issues raised, and the purpose for which we have hearings is to allow those issues to be aired and to give a person an opportunity to respond. In the absence of that hearing, of course, the allegations remain. In many instances, as the Senator from Pennsylvania has pointed out, there is never the kind of opportunity to respond with the same voice and the same positioning with which the allegations are oftentimes made. 
Under our system it is absolutely essential in my view that she be given that opportunity. I am totally confident that she will respond to those issues when she is asked publicly to respond to them. It is part of the process here going back years that when people are nominated for high office in any administration they are always advised not to respond or comment but to save their comments for a hearing. Oftentimes it happens that the nominee is left in the position of having to face an assault of questions that are raised and never gets the opportunity to respond because you are advised to the contrary. Then for whatever reason, if you never get that hearing, they stay out there. 
So I applaud my colleague from Pennsylvania for coming to the floor this afternoon and raising this issue. I join with him in urging that our committee--and I sit on the Labor Committee--set up a hearing as soon as possible and move forward. Then, as the Senator from Pennsylvania has pointed out, the committee and/or this body will express its opinion one way or the other. But we will resolve the matter and not leave the individual out there to hang, if you will, in limbo. With all of the appropriate suggestions that the Senator from Pennsylvania has made, as we try to attract people to come serve in our Government and they watch examples like this, it is very difficult to convince people to step forward when they see what can happen to someone who is, in my view, entirely innocent of any of the allegations raised but never gets the opportunity to address them. 
So I applaud my colleague.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment I have offered here this afternoon. We have several hours of debate. It may not be necessary to consume all of that time. I will notify my colleagues. Others may want to come over and address the issue. Although we have set a time of 5:30 p.m. for a vote, we may find ourselves having exhausted all of the brilliance on both sides of this amendment and able to move to a vote earlier than that. It would take unanimous consent to vote earlier, but that may happen at some time here this afternoon. 
In the meantime, Mr. President, let me state once again what this amendment does. I urge my colleagues and others to pay attention. I will put aside the debate of whether or not we ought to have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. That matter has been debated and will be debated over the next several days. 
The amendment that I raise, Mr. President, does not address the underlying question of whether or not we ought to have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. But it addresses section 5, and section 5 only, of the proposed amendment. It raises what I believe to be a very legitimate issue in dealing with the national security of this country. 
This is an amendment that I offer which you could support and do no damage--in fact, I would think strengthen--the argument in support of the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. I myself have serious underlying problems with the constitutional amendment. I do not want my colleagues to have any illusions about that. But I am going to put aside that debate and ask my colleagues to draw their attention to section 5 and an amendment that I will offer that I think addresses a legitimate concern. 
My amendment corrects two serious flaws in this section. Let me read this section, if I can. Section 5 of the proposed amendment, not my amendment, the proposed constitutional amendment, says: 
The Congress may waive the provisions of this article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security and is so declared by a joint resolution adopted by a majority of the whole number of each House which becomes law. 
First of all, this most important section currently contains language, in my view, that would seriously undermine--the distinguished Presiding Officer is a former Attorney General, and someone who has had a serious amount of experience in judicial matters will appreciate that every word in the constitutional amendment is not a casual word. These words must be selected very, very carefully. So I do not treat this lightly at all. 
`A declaration of war'--these are the words that are most of concern to me--and `the United States is engaged in a military conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security . . .' 
The provisions of the balanced budget are waived only if war is declared, or if the United States is `engaged.' The balanced budget amendment is quite clear in specifying that our Nation must be engaged in military conflict before a waiver can be granted. 
The problem, as I see it, is that prudent foreign policy often requires responding to serious threats before we actually become involved in military conflict. Yet, the language of this amendment is `engaged'--not `might be engaged or there is a threat of engagement'--but rather is `engaged' in military conflict. 
Throughout our history this Nation has often found itself necessarily engaged in conflict but yet in situations where immediate action was essential. The gulf war is one example that immediately comes to mind. I will discuss that example and others in the debate shortly. 
My amendment removes this section 5 and would lift the provisions of the balanced budget amendment under a declaration of war or if the United States faces an imminent and serious military threat to national security. The requirement of being engaged is dropped. 
The amendment that I offer would also clearly define the role of Congress in certifying the existence of an imminent and serious military threat. Under the current language, in section 5 the courts could conceivably be called on to determine whether or not an imminent and serious military threat to national security exists. 
My amendment--the amendment that I offer and is at the desk--makes clear that a resolution passed by Congress is the sole requirement for certifying that such a threat exists. 
Finally, the amendment that I have offered restores a reasonable standard for voting. The balanced budget amendment creates a cumbersome, I believe, standard for passing the resolution certifying that a military threat exists. It says a `majority of the whole number of each House' must pass the resolution. In the case of the U.S. Senate, this means that 51 Senators would have to vote in favor of the resolution, no matter how many Senators were present and voting. This could be absolutely critical, particularly in a time of national crisis. When not all Senators are able to reach Washington on short notice, for instance, we could be prevented by our own Constitution from quickly and properly responding to an international emergency. 
Furthermore, the `whole number' standard leaves open the question, I point out, of whether or not the Vice President would be allowed to cast a vote should we arrive at a tie of 50-50. My amendment alleviates this problem by requiring a simple majority of those present and voting for passage of the waiver resolution. 
Mr. President, I am well aware of the heartfelt support, as I mentioned at the outset, of these remarks on the part of my colleagues who are squarely for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
I also know that many of us--myself included, clearly--have underlying problems with the whole balanced budget amendment. But I think we should all be able to agree, regardless of where we are positioned on the issue of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, we should all be able to agree that any amendment to the Constitution should in no way shackle our country in time of an emergency. 
The amendment that I offer, Mr. President, I think helps ensure that the Nation remains prepared and able to respond in time of an international crisis. 
For these reasons, I hope that it will enjoy the support of a broad majority of my colleagues. 
Mr. President, I want to cite the language of the amendment that we are offering. 
Let me recite the copy of the amendment that I am offering:  
On page 3, line 7, strike beginning with `is' through line 11 and insert, `faces an imminent and serious military threat to national security as declared by a joint resolution.' 
The point being here, if you are not actually engaged, or you don't have a declaration of war and the Nation, in preparation for such a conflict, wants to exceed the balanced budget requirements, we should be able to do that. 
I do not know of anyone who would believe that, as important as this amendment is, it should have a higher priority than the national security interests of the country. Yet, my fear is based on the exact language of section 5--that that is the problem we have posed before us. If it requires a declaration of war, or requires, as the language reads, `is engaged in a conflict,' it seems to me that we would have to wait for one of those two conditions to be met in order to waive any constitutional requirements prohibiting deficit financing. 
And so I would urge the adoption of this amendment which says, `faces an imminent and serious military threat to national security as declared by a joint resolution,' so that we do not allow the courts to decide. You can imagine a debate going on here about whether or not an imminent and serious threat existed, someone runs to the Federal courts and says, `I don't think it is an imminent and serious military threat,' and we have a panel of judges deciding whether or not that threat exists. I do not think any of us want to see that happen. So the joint resolution allows that a simple majority of Senators would be able to declare the threat in order to waive the provisions of the balanced budget amendment. 
I mentioned earlier, Mr. President, that there are historical examples for this that I think point out the problem. They are historical and they may be 100 years old or 20 years old. None of us can say with any certainty what we may face tomorrow or next week or next year or the next century. But I will cite five examples to point out the problems. 
Imagine, if you will, that this section in a constitutional amendment to balance the budget were in place at the time we faced these five crises. Ask yourself how would we have responded, what would have been the implications, putting aside whether or not you were for or against the particular issue at hand. 
The gulf war is one; lend-lease, back in the late 1930's, early 1940's, the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, the Panama crisis back under the Bush administration, and the defense buildup during the Reagan administration. 
Let me cite, first of all, the gulf war example. Saddam Hussein, as many in this Chamber will recall and, invaded Kuwait on August 1, 1990. We were running a deficit, I would point out, Mr. President, at that time of $221 billion, on August 1, 1990, putting us in gross violation requirements of the balanced budget amendment. There were only 2 months left in the fiscal year, no time to adjust spending or to raise taxes, I might point out. We were not certain ourselves how we were going to respond to that situation, but an invasion of Kuwait clearly had happened. Saddam Hussein was threatening not only Kuwait where he had invaded but Saudi Arabia, and clearly our security I think. By controlling Saudi Arabia, of course, he would have become a dominant force in the gulf, and the obvious implications of that for the United States and the West are clear. 
We had to deploy troops to protect our allies and our security, and the President did so. But we were not engaged in a conflict, and we had not gone through the lengthy process of making a declaration of war. It was merely a question of whether or not we were going to be able to place those troops immediately in the Middle East in anticipation because an imminent threat certainly occurred, but we were not engaged. It was not until January 16, 1991 that we began the air war. The initial deployment to defend Saudi Arabia, Desert Shield as it was called, was 100,000 troops. The eventual deployment to prepare to invade Kuwait was 500,000 troops. The total cost was $71 billion. The deficit, as I pointed out, was $221 billion. 
Our action, I would argue, could not have happened under a balanced budget amendment under section 5 because we were not engaged in military conflict. A resolution allowing military action to force out Hussein passed the Senate in January 52 to 47, after a lengthy debate about whether or not we ought to use military force immediately. 
My colleague from Utah certainly was here and remembers that debate. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle who supported the action in the gulf ought to remember this and remember what happened. 
If the balanced budget amendment had been in effect in 1990, a minority of Senators could have blocked those Senators who supported action and we would not have been able to have the waiver. I do not know what the implications would have been. 
In 20-20 hindsight, we say, look, it was clear. As things worked out, there was an imminent threat. There was a debate here, heated debate in the country about what our action should be. You can imagine in addition to the complicated questions of whether or not we ought to respond, we would have had to go through and waive constitutional amendment requirements. This would have been with all of the people in this country divided, as many were, over whether or not we ought to be involved in the Middle East, putting United States servicemen and women at risk. With all the questions, we then either would have had to go through a process of declaring war, which we have not done in 55 years, or go through a process of waiting for an actual engagement to occur. As section 5 says, engaged--not likely to be engaged, not might be engaged, not a threat of engagement. It says you must be engaged. 
So my amendment, as I pointed out earlier, which talks about the imminent threat, facing an imminent and serious military threat to national security, is a far better standard and test, it seems to me, in order for us to respond to those situations. 
Let me cite the example, if I can, of lend-lease. There is no one in this Chamber who was serving at the time. Our colleague from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, of course, remembers this debate, I am sure, very vividly, as someone who served in World War II, I believe the only remaining colleague of ours who served in World War II. 
Britain was in a crisis. We were highly divided in this country in the late 1930's as to whether or not the United States ought to be involved. In fact, I think surveys at the time indicated most Americans were opposed to the United States being involved in a European conflict. We had in fact America First groups. Charles Lindbergh, I recall, was a leading proponent of the United States staying out of World War II. The conflict in Europe was raging. So we had a significant debate in this country over whether or not we ought to be involved. 
I do not know of anyone today who would argue that the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt, putting together the creative lend-lease program, providing the military assistance Britain needed in its great hour of crisis, did not make all the difference in the world. And but for the lend-lease program, the map of Europe might look substantially different, not to mention what might have occurred elsewhere had we not taken that action. 
We were not engaged in the conflict, under the standard asked to be met in this balanced budget amendment. You were not likely to get a declaration of war in 1939 given the divisions in the country. And yet we had a deficit. Now, it was not a huge deficit. It was, in March of that year, 1941, $4.9 billion. It sounds pretty small by today's standards, but as a percentage of the budget it was probably not substantially different than today. And even with someone with the prowess of Franklin Roosevelt, can you imagine if we had to go then through the waiver process in order to get the kind of resources necessary. I do not want to dwell on this particular instance but nonetheless I think the point is quite clear. We would have required a waiver. We were highly divided as a country. As it turned out, lend-lease got a lot of support. In the vote that occurred, actually a majority, a substantial majority here supported lend-lease. But certainly those who are students of history recall the great division in the country on this issue complicating the problem, and the difficulty that Franklin Roosevelt would have had in responding to that situation. 
The Cuban missile crisis, in 1962. Again, we were not engaged. There was clearly a threat, in my view, to the security of the United States. We were not going to declare war at that particular point at all. The President had to respond to that situation. We had a deficit of $7.1 billion in 1962. But under the standards as laid out in the balanced budget amendment, the proposed language in section 5, the buildup that President Kennedy initiated to respond to that would have required us to go through all these difficulties of requiring waivers. Or you would have had to have the courts decide if in fact it met the standard of an imminent and serious military threat. 
The invasion of Panama, again, another example. The deficit in 1989 was $153 billion. The cost of the operation was $163 million. Clearly we would have had to go through this process as well. 
And the Reagan years of the buildup in defense. Again, you could argue--certainly everyone would have, I think--that there was an imminent danger of conflict with the Soviet Union. We were not going to declare war against them. We were not engaged in a military conflict against them. We had sizable deficits, and we increased defense spending between 1980 and 1988 from $134 billion to $290 billion. 
Of course, we were accumulating $1.5 trillion in debt at the same time. The amendment says: Declaration of war, engaged in a conflict. Many argue today the ultimate collapse of the Soviet Union was a direct result of our buildup at that time; that it was the Soviets' inability to meet that buildup, although they tried, that caused the kind of economic collapse that resulted in the downfall of the Soviet Union. Yet, we would have gone through this process, and you can only imagine the debate--and there was a significant one, by the way, over whether or not we ought to support that buildup or not--you can imagine what would have been heard around these Chambers about the constitutional amendment to balance the budget and whether or not we ought to be doing this. It could have complicated that process seriously. 
I think you could have met the test in 1980 through 1988, of saying the Soviet Union posed an imminent and serious military threat to national security, and then had a joint resolution passed, as my amendment that I am offering today would have allowed us to do, that would have gotten you through the process. That is why I am offering the amendment. I am not just striking section 5, I am offering new language as an alternative. 
So the Reagan buildup, I think, is another good example of what could have occurred. I am not arguing for or against it, where people were on that issue, but just imagine the kind of debate that would have ensued. 
Let me also point up another argument here that I think deserves mention. One of the difficulties in preparing, of course, is you do not want to give your potential adversary any additional opportunities to take advantage of what is inherently a process that is slow in this country, our legislative form of government, our democracy. If a potential opponent knows that we have this balanced budget amendment, with section 5, that requires a declaration of war, that we have to be engaged, that we need waivers with a whole House voting, 218 House Members, 51 Senators, that is a pretty significant advantage to give. That is one more set of hurdles that we have to go over in order to respond. 
I do not think that is engaging in hyperbole, Mr. President. Why would we in any way try to make it more cumbersome for the Commander in Chief of this country--not necessarily this one, because this amendment will not go into effect until long after this President has left office, but some future Chief Executive of our Nation--to be able to respond to those situations? I am not saying they ought to be able to do it without any check by the Congress, but I think stating the country needs only to face an imminent threat and then get a joint resolution ought to be enough to get a waiver of this amendment. To insist upon a declaration of war or actual engagement seems to me to be setting far too high a standard when the national security interests of this country could be in jeopardy. Yet, that is exactly what we are doing with this amendment. 
So, for those reasons I hope my colleagues will look favorably upon this amendment, even if you are for the underlying amendment. I think this improves the underlying amendment. Some have suggested we should not have offered this amendment because, for those of us who have serious doubts about setting fiscal policy in the Constitution, the adoption of this amendment certainly takes away one of, I think, the most significant arguments against the balanced budget amendment. That is that we place the language of this amendment in a higher priority, in a higher standard, than the national security interests of the country. 
I see my colleague from Michigan is here. I have some more comments I would like to make in a few moments, but unless my colleague from Utah, who may want to be heard at this particular moment, so desires--I have just been informed, by the way, I made the mistake of saying `Senator Thurmond,' and I have quickly been informed by several offices, Mr. President, here--not the senior 
Senator from Utah, but Senator Bumpers, Senator Chafee, Senator Warner, Senator Inouye, Senator Akaka, and Senator Hollings, Glenn, Helms, Roth, and Stevens have been ringing up the phones here. I apologize to my colleagues. I thought they were much younger than that, and assumed they were. How am I doing here? Am I recovering from that faux pas? 
However you want to do this. I will yield the floor at this point, and, obviously, the Senator from Utah has priority.

</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-dodd-ct-5-19970212</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for that. I want to respond to a couple of provisions. The amendment we have before us, the amendment that I offered here, requires that we face an imminent and serious military threat to national security as declared by joint resolution. I was informed `as declared by joint resolution' does not mean someone really introducing a resolution, but that a joint resolution would have to pass both Houses. 
But I am fully prepared to offer an amendment. It would take unanimous consent to clarify any ambiguity about my intention here. This is not a declaration by an individual Member, but a decision by both Houses that an imminent and dangerous situation exists. I will modify my amendment so as to remove any question of my intention here and what the legislative office, in drafting this, informed this Senator that the language `declared by joint resolution' certainly means. If there is any doubt in anybody's mind, I'll do that. The last thing I want to do is have any one Senator able to offer a resolution that would trigger a waiver of the balanced budget amendment. 
Second, I think it is important because the Secretary's name has been raised by my friend from Utah on numerous occasions. Allow me, for the benefit of my colleagues, to read from prepared testimony from the Secretary of Defense: 
We are here today not to give you a comprehensive discussion of the balanced budget amendment, but rather to discuss specifically one very important aspect, which is the effect it would have [the balanced budget amendment] on our national security and particularly the effect it would have on our defense programs. Almost any reasonable assumption of how the balanced budget amendment would be implemented in spinning budgets and in specific programs would affect the defense programs in a fundamental way and I believe would fundamentally undermine the security of the Nation. 
Let me emphasize that and repeat it: 
. . . I believe it would fundamentally undermine the security of the Nation. In addition to that, the balanced budget amendment would threaten frequent interruptions of many long-term processes that are essential to maintaining a prudent defense posture. 
The statement goes on longer, but those particular words certainly don't leave any doubt as to where the Secretary of Defense stands on this issue. 
Third--and then I will allow my colleague from Utah to pick up where he wanted to--I urge my colleagues to read the report language in section 5 of the Judiciary Committee on this amendment, as it gives an explanation of what section 5 means. On page 22, Madam President, I am quoting, and it is dated February 3, 1997: 
This section, as amended, guarantees that Congress will retain maximum flexibility in responding to clear national security crises, such as in declared war or imminent military threat to national security. 
Now, if that is what it did, I would not offer this amendment. But it does not. It should take into consideration the declaration of war or imminent military threat to national security. But that is not what the amendment says. The amendment says in section 5, which is before us: 
. . . the United States is engaged in military conflict, which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security. 
It is the `engaged' part that I have such difficulty with here, because if it just said `imminent military threat to national security,' then you could say, fine, I understand that. We have a threat out there; we are not engaged yet, but we have a threat. So we ought to be able to pass a joint resolution here that declares that threat to exist, and the waiver then would apply. But this is not flexible. My colleagues ought to understand that. It is not flexible. You must have a declaration of war and/or this Nation must be engaged in military conflict, and it requires all 218 House Members and all 51 Senators--not 49 to 48, but 51--to then waive the provisions. 
I think that is so restrictive. As important as my colleagues believe this amendment is in dealing with the fiscal matters of this country--and I am not here to argue that point today, Madam President, because that is an ongoing debate. I accept the 
sincerity of those who propose this amendment. But I hope no one would suggest that, as important as the fiscal matters of this country are, we would make it so restrictive for the Nation to respond to a military crisis that we would require a declaration of war or actual engagement in a conflict before we could decide to waive these provisions in order to respond to them. I think that is threatening. 
This is a dangerous section, as written, regardless of how one feels about the constitutional amendment. This is dangerous. This is clearly dangerous. I ask my colleagues--this is not report language now. We are talking about the actual words included in the organic law of our country, the organic law. Every word, every letter is important. It is not insignificant. These are not casual words. To require a declaration of war or to be actually engaged in military conflict before you can waive the provisions of this constitutional amendment, I think, is dangerous indeed. I am offering an amendment which does not strike it altogether but which says `faces an imminent and serious military threat to national security as declared by a joint resolution.' That way, if there is an imminent threat to our national security, a majority of us here and in the other body can pass a resolution that declares that to be the case, and then we ought to be able to waive the provisions and respond to them. 
My colleagues know as many examples as I do where we have not met the threshold of a declaration of war or been engaged in a military conflict. Examples where we, the overwhelming majority, I suspect, would have assumed there was enough of an imminent threat out there that we should have responded. We also see a highly divisive country when we see that. I do not offer this lightly, as others have suggested, as somehow a back-door approach for liberal spending programs. This goes right to the heart of our Nation's response to a crisis and whether or not we elevate the importance of fiscal prudence here to such a status that it exceeds the ability of the Nation to respond under its primary, essential function, and that is to protect the security of our Nation. 
I suggest, Madam President--in fact, I will read this. On page 22, the last section--they define, by the way, in these sections what each word means. The bottom of page 22 of the report.  
. . . is engaged in military conflict. 
Here is how the report defines those words: 
`. . . is engaged in military conflict,' is intended to limit the applicability of this waiver to situations involving the actual use of military force which nonetheless do not rise to the level of a formal declaration of war. 
This isn't my language. This is the report language. I am not interpreting this language. It must involve the actual use of military force before they meet the threshold of imminent danger. 
There are just hundreds of cases where something that does not involve actual use of force can meet the threshold of imminent danger. Yet, the authors of the section, very clearly --and you can imagine a Federal court, some day in the next century, reading this language as to what the words mean, and it doesn't say likely use of force or maybe a use of force, but actual use of force. We have the awkward situation, to put it mildly, of this Nation responding to its primary function--that is, to protect its citizenry when placed under threat. 
Again, I will offer at the appropriate moment--I don't know why I need to, but if certain people think I have drafted this in a way to suggest that any one Member can offer a resolution and that is going to trigger a waiver--again, I submitted my language to the legislative offices here to prepare this, and they tell me that the `declared by a joint resolution' meets that standard of what the intent is here--clearly, not just any one Member offering a resolution, but obviously both Houses passing it. I haven't gotten to the language in the amendment about the whole House, in terms of having 51 people. We have seen situations where Members don't get back, for whatever reason, where some crisis faces the Nation and Members can't get here. What a ridiculous situation to place this body in. I know we're not living in the horse-and-buggy age here, when Members couldn't get here and where they sat around and waited for enough Members to arrive which would allow a majority of both Houses to respond. 
But we sat here and determined that somehow meets purity, and insisted upon the whole of both Houses, and then, of course, I believe we excluded the Vice President from casting a vote in a tie. You have to have 51 votes of the Members, and the Vice President while the Presiding Officer is not a Member of this body. And I think that is a shortcoming as well. It is minor compared to the actual language here that requires a declaration of war, or as the report language defines is engaged in military conflict, it must involve the actual use of military force. I think that standard is way too high for us to be able to waive the provisions of this balanced budget amendment to respond to a security crisis in this country. 
You can vote for my amendment, and you can be for the balanced budget amendment. It does not threaten the underlying purpose of a balanced budget amendment. I believe it is a lot wiser to be cautious on all issues of national security. This is not some secondary or collateral issue. This is the primary function of any government. The primary function is to protect the security of the people. We have set a standard here that I think places that primary responsibility in some jeopardy. 
So for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment. And I will be glad to yield the floor at this point. I will raise a couple of additional issues in a few minutes. But let me yield the floor.

Let us say I disagreed with you. I run to Federal court. I read the language there and I cite the report language and the report language says, under this section, `is engaged in military conflict involving the actual use of military force.' 
My point to the court would be that is not actual use of military force. Therefore you cannot waive this provision.

You are subjugating, I say with all due respect to my wonderful friend, you are subjugating national security interests to the fiscal concerns you raise in this budget. Your priorities are switched. As important as fiscal matters are, to place in jeopardy the ability of the United States to respond quickly and efficiently to an imminent threat to its national security, for the life of me, I don't understand why we would be risking that.

Mr. DODD. Please. I am not suggesting here--let us put aside the underlying debate on the constitutional amendment to balance the budget.

</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-dodd-ct-56-19970212</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DODD. The language--I urge again my colleague to read it--I am not making the language up and writing the report language--says, `in which a declaration of war is in effect,' and, also, `The provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in a military conflict.' 
Put aside the issue of how we vote here. The language says `is engaged in a military conflict.' I turn to the report language that defines those words. On page 22, it says it must involve the actual use of military force. 
I just know my colleagues can think of numerous examples--not phony ones, not insignificant ones--where there was imminent threat, the national security of this country was in jeopardy, we were not engaged, we were not actually using military force, but we would have wanted to waive the provisions of this particular section in order to respond to it. 
Whether you are for or against the constitutional amendment, it seems to me is a collateral issue at this point. The question I raise is: This language is so restrictive, 
it requires a declaration of war or actual engagement. Courts will interpret every word of this language in the constitutional amendment. 
My suggestion is not to get rid of this altogether. Keep in the declaration of war, but add or replace the language `engaged' and talk about the imminent threat to the national security and require a resolution to be adopted by both Houses so that it isn't just one person's interpretation, but that a majority of those present and voting in both Houses. 
That is not a slight hurdle to overcome, particularly when it amounts to waiving the provisions of a balanced budget amendment. I presume my colleagues will take that seriously. But we ought to be able to do it short of actual engagement in a conflict, and if we don't, I think we restrict this Nation's ability to respond to future conflicts that could jeopardize our national security and the people of this country. 
We do not take our jobs lightly. We would have to meet that threshold. We would understand by doing so, we would waive the provisions of the Constitution. That is a very serious matter to undertake. It is not just a casual resolution. But it seems to me we ought to be able to do so in preparation for something that may involve the engagement of our men and women, our forces, and prepare them for it and prepare the Nation for it. We cannot do that under section five as presently written.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me briefly sum up, if I can, this amendment. I think the handwriting is on the wall. It is one of those moments, the wave is moving here, and I deeply regret it. 
I have the feeling my colleagues have just not read section 5 as carefully as we should. I emphasize again and draw their attention to this not based on the argument that I asked them to not support the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, but merely that we improve this section to reflect, I think, what ought to be the priorities of a nation; that is, to be able to respond to an imminent threat to our national security and be allowed to do that in a way that would permit us to waive the restrictions of this amendment. The priority of responding, I think, is a higher one than the issue of the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
I draw the attention of my colleagues to some pivotal words in this section, `a declaration of war,' or the United States must be `engaged in military conflict,' particularly that latter one, Mr. President. It does not talk about imminent danger. We must actually be engaged. 
It is ironic in many ways that we can have a declaration of war which can be reached by a simple majority here. A simple majority of Senators present and voting can declare war. You do not require that all Members be here to declare war. No vote we ever cast could ever be more profound than to commit our Nation to war. Yet, to waive the budget requirement of this amendment requires a special parliamentary proceeding which excludes the vote of the Vice President, and requires a majority of all Members regardless of who is present in order to waive the restrictions of this so we can respond to a conflict. How ironic that in the very same section you have a declaration of war that can be reached by a simple majority of Members present and voting, and yet to waive the restrictions of this amendment requires a `super' number, if you will, beyond that which is necessary to commit this Nation. 
So I urge my colleagues to look at this amendment that will be at the desk when you come to vote in a few minutes. We replace this language by saying that the Nation faces an imminent and serious military threat to national security as declared by a joint resolution that is passed into law. We must vote that we are facing that imminent threat. If we vote accordingly, that we are facing an imminent threat, then it seems to me that to waive the restrictions here is the only sensible thing to do. To require today that we have a declaration of war, the perverse idea that a President and Congress, in a future time may declare war just to avoid the restrictions of this amendment, or to actually be engaged in a conflict and not allow our Nation to prepare for a likely conflict, concerns me deeply. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, and I thank my colleague from West Virginia for his support of this amendment, but I urge my colleagues to please read this amendment and read this section and realize what great harm and danger we could be creating for our Nation if we adopt this amendment with this section as written, which I think places this Nation in an unrealistic and dangerous straitjacket. 
I thank my colleague from Utah for yielding the time.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, at some point, I believe a unanimous-consent request will be entered into, and we will set out the agenda for tomorrow's business, including an allocation of time for morning business, as well as an allocation of time for an amendment, which I will shortly propose, to be considered. 
I gather the respective leaders are working on that. In anticipation, Mr. President, I have been asked, in order to move the process along and make sure we have some business to conduct tomorrow, to submit an amendment. I will briefly describe the amendment this afternoon and then yield the floor. Based on the allocation of time the leaders are able to agree upon, we will engage more fully in the debate tomorrow.

 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true Panamanian statesman, a renowned diplomat, and a good friend of the United States--Gabriel Lewis Galindo. 
Gabriel Lewis was considered his nation's leading expert on foreign affairs. And, over the past 20 years he was an influential figure in nearly all the major issues that dominated United States-Panamanian relations. 
As Panama's Ambassador to the United States in the late 1970's, he played an integral role in helping to negotiate the Panama Canal treaties, which will transfer control of the waterway to Panama in the year 2000. In the end, Gabriel Lewis's abundant personal charm and charisma were a guiding force behind not only the resolution of those negotiations, but Senate approval of the treaties. 
Gabriel Lewis was also a persistent and powerful voice for democracy in Panama. He became an outspoken and forceful opponent of the regime of Gen. Manuel Noriega seeking exile in the United States after being charged with treason in his native country. 
Here in the United States, he continued his tireless struggles on behalf of Panamanian democracy, mobilizing support against the Noriega regime and leading efforts to increase United States economic pressure on Panama. 
After the overthrow of Noriega, Gabriel Lewis continued his commitment to public service and the Panamanian people by becoming Panama's Foreign Minister in 1994. Almost immediately, he was working to improve United States-Panamanian relations. Soon after taking office, he recommended that the newly elected President of Panama, Ernesto Balladares, take in up to 10,000 Cuban refugees helping to defuse a growing crisis in the Caribbean. 
Often in this body we honor great Americans who are a tribute to their community and their Nation. But we must also take the time to pay homage to those, who from abroad, are the embodiment of the values and precepts we hold dear as Americans. Gabriel Lewis Galindo was just such a man and he will be sorely missed both in his native Panama and by those who knew and respected him here in the United States. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Nita, his 6 children, and his 21 grandchildren.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as a matter of cold war aggression, Soviet troops invaded, as we all remember, Afghanistan in December of 1979. After years of harsh struggle for independence, the Afghan people finally achieved that goal of independence in 1992. No sooner, however, had the Soviet threat been lifted than a new destabilizing force emerged in that region. Then, instead of fighting outside aggressors, the Afghans started fighting among themselves. 
Today, Afghan civilians continue to live in constant fear: fear of being embroiled in armed conflict; fear of being abducted by one militia group or another; fear of persecution and torture; fear of rape and sexual harassment; and, finally, fear of dying an early and senseless death. 
Amnesty International has done an excellent job of monitoring and reporting on the deteriorating human rights situation in Afghanistan. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a factsheet prepared by Amnesty International be printed at the end of these remarks.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the conflict in Afghanistan has changed dramatically in recent months. In September 1996, the Taliban coalition seized the capital city of Kabul, thereby securing control of two-thirds of the territory of Afghanistan. 
The Taliban, many of whom grew up and were educated in the refugee camps in Pakistan during the war years of the 1980's, see themselves as the guardians of Afghan security and stability. Unfortunately, this guardianship has had very harsh consequences for the women and young girls of Afghanistan. Moreover, in an effort to solidify total control over Afghanistan, they continue to engage militarily with the other factions led by various leaders of that country. Today, the Taliban controls three-quarters of the nation. 
Mr. President, my concern here is that we have had significant reports of terrible abuse of the young women of Afghanistan by the Taliban, including denying them even the basic opportunities to work. Many of the teachers in Afghanistan were women. They have been denied entirely the right to work, to teach. 
Internal tensions have been exacerbated by players who have encouraged the various factions to continue the armed conflict in order to advance their own selfish economic and security interests. Outside assistance in the form of arms transfer, military training, and financial aid seriously undermined international efforts to broker a political solution to the conflict. 
With respect to humanitarian issues, the fact of the matter is that none of the parties involved in the civil conflict are innocent. All have contributed to the extraordinary human rights crisis. 
While all these human rights abuses concern me, today I want to call specific attention to the deteriorating human rights practices as they relate to the rights and treatment against Afghan women and girls--much of these at the hands of the Taliban. I am deeply disturbed by the Taliban's discriminatory treatment of women and girls. Some of the most objectionable features of the Taliban's discriminatory policies include barring women from employment, prohibiting girls from attending schools, restricting the times when women and girls may leave their homes, and mandating a restrictive dress code for females. Moreover, the Taliban has reacted to women and girls who stray from these restrictive policies with public rebukes in the form of street beatings and stonings. 
I believe, and imagine most of my colleagues would agree that: Women should have the right to work--to earn a living for their families using their knowledge, expertise, and skills; girls and women must be given access to basic education; and both women and men must be afforded a basic sense of humanity and respect. Street beatings, amputations, and other forms of summary justice for alleged crimes are unacceptable. 
The United States cannot stand idly by in the face of unconscionable violations of basic human rights and needless killings. We certainly cannot condone, by our silence, the plainly discriminatory practices which severely handicap women and girls. 
I believe that the resolution I have introduced today will call public attention to the serious situation in Afghanistan. I urge my colleagues to join me in reaffirming the need for a peaceful settlement for a country that has been plagued by the brutality of war for too many years; in urging all the factions in Afghanistan to adhere to internationally recognized principles of human rights; and in calling an end to the Taliban's discriminatory policies toward women and girls. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the enactment of this resolution at the appropriate time. 
I am going to, Mr. President, send this resolution to the desk. And I urge my colleagues to take a look at it, along with a report from Amnesty International, and urge that they join with me in our condemnation of these events as they are occurring today. 
Hopefully, we can consider this resolution at some appropriate time on the floor of the U.S. Senate and adopt it and send a clear message that those of us in this body--while there are many issues we deal with at home--that an issue such as this basic fundamental denial of human rights should not go unrecognized as an institution here that cares so deeply about it in a bipartisan way as we have talked about so frequently. I urge they give their support to this resolution. I just send it to the desk, Mr. President.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, I express my gratitude to the majority leader for graciously arranging at the end of the business time for me to address the issue at hand, and that is the proposed constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
I, like all of my colleagues, do not know a single Member of this body who disagrees with the proposition that we ought to be balancing the budget or getting us close to it and as quickly as we possibly can. I don't think there is any debate about the desired goal shared by everyone in this Chamber and the overwhelming majority of Americans in this country for a balanced budget. They do, I think, Mr. President, share this goal for wise reason. 
I was asked the other day in a classroom in my home State of Connecticut by students, `Why is balancing the budget, why is there so much talk about that? What is the importance of that?' Maybe we take for granted that everyone understands the answer. We talk about it as if it were an end in and of itself, rather than the implications of a balanced budget for our Nation and, for that matter, people who live beyond our Nation. 
The reason is that balancing the budget is not a goal in and of itself. It is what it does, what it creates, and that is, of course, a sound economy and an expanded economy. It creates jobs in the country and opportunities for people that wouldn't otherwise exist if we were operating with a mountain of debt that forced the U.S. Government to compete in the borrowing business with private institutions and individuals. 
By balancing the budget, what we are doing is contributing significantly to the economic growth and the job creation that is absolutely essential if any nation is going to succeed, and particularly if we are going to be successful in the 21st century. 
Balancing the budget has importance, but its real importance is not in and of itself, but rather what it contributes to the overall wealth and strength of our Nation. 
So I begin these remarks, Mr. President, by stating what I think is the obvious--I hope it is the obvious--and that is that every Member of this body believes that balancing the Federal budget is an issue of critical importance to our Nation's future. Across the political spectrum, from the White House to the Capitol, among Democrats and Republicans, liberals, conservatives, moderates, whatever label people wish to place on themselves or are placed on them, there exists, I think, a broad-based consensus on the desire for bringing the Federal budget into balance. 
In fact, in the last Congress, both the President and the Republican leaders agreed in principle to a 7-year balanced budget plan. The sticking point then was the details of those plans, not the notion of a balanced budget itself. So the debate today is not about whether we should balance the budget. That we agree on. The debate today, and will be over the coming days, is how we balance the budget. 
The proponents of this constitutional amendment would have us believe otherwise. They would lead us to believe that the Congress is simply incapable of mustering the necessary courage to make the tough choices to balance the budget. They would have us believe that only by an amendment to the U.S. Constitution would we be forced, and future Congresses forced, to act. 
Mr. President, when one considers our efforts at reducing the deficit over the past half dozen years, I think it is fair to say such an assertion lacks credibility. Over the past decade, the deficit, as a percentage of the gross domestic product, has shrunk by more than 70 percent. Let me restate that. Over the past decade, the deficit as a percentage of the gross domestic product has shrunk by more than 70 percent. Today, it is only 1.4 percent of the gross domestic product. In fact, as a percentage of the 
economy, the deficit is at its lowest level in more than a generation in this country. 
These figures clearly demonstrate that contrary to the conventional wisdom, contrary to the rhetoric from across the aisle, and from other places, this body does, in fact, possess ample courage to reduce the deficit. In fact, the tremendous decreases in the Federal deficit came in the last 4 years, as this chart to my left, I think, amply demonstrates. 
I will just point out, it is entitled `Bringing the Deficit Down to Ground Zero,' which we all agreed should occur by the year 2002. What is indicated by these dots and lines, in 1992, the annual deficit stood at $290 billion. Based on the projections in 1992, that deficit was going to increase each year from $302 billion over 1993 and 1994, going up to $312 billion, then up to $319 billion in 1996, $351 billion by 1997, $391 billion by 1998. Those were the projections for the increase in the deficit that we were given in 1993. 
But in 1993, as many will recall, we adopted a budget plan that was, unfortunately, not bipartisan, Mr. President. It was adopted with just Democratic votes. Those were the days when we were in the majority on this side. That is, before the arrival of the distinguished Presiding Officer. 
We were in the majority and passed a budget resolution here in the U.S. Senate. A similar one was passed in the House. They were done in the most uncommon of fashions. Usually there is some bipartisanship. But this one was done exclusively with Democratic votes, on both sides. 
It was hotly contested, hotly debated. People may recall it was decided by one vote, I think, in the House of Representatives, and I think by that margin here in the Senate as well. In fact, I think it was the vote of the Vice President at the time casting the vote that made that possible. At any rate, it was a very narrow vote. 
But what has happened since then, since 1993, and that budget resolution? We have seen by 1993, instead of being $302 billion, the deficit went from $290 billion to $255 billion. Then it has proceeded, over the next 3 years, down to $203 billion, $164 billion, and in 1996, $107 billion. 
What we hope is going to occur with this budget proposal that is before us now, and over the next 5 years, is that the budget will continue, based on the projections included, will fall to that ground zero, balancing the budget by the year 2002. 
Let me state here that I appreciate immensely the reaction, of the majority in both this body and in the House of Representatives, to the President's budget. That is not to say they have endorsed the budget. Quite to the contrary, there are significant disagreements. But unlike almost every year that I can recall, Mr. President, whether it was a Republican President or a Democratic President, with the submission of budgets you could almost guarantee the press releases would go out from whoever was the opposing party in the legislative branch announcing that the budget was dead on arrival and we began this tremendous fight on Capitol Hill to try to come up with a new budget altogether. 
That is not the case this year. I give the majority here credit, as well as the administration, for working ahead of time to try to come up with some common ground on some of the more delicate issues. As I said, there has not been total agreement, but we are not in the same situation we have been in the past where this turns into a huge battle from the very beginning. 
So my hope is, despite what previous history there may have been, we are now going to be able to work on a budget agreement that gets us to that ground zero in the year 2002. That is really what we ought to be doing. Because as the Presiding Officer knows, and others are certainly aware, writing something into the Constitution and issuing a press release about it does not make it happen. You have to do the work. 
Whether it is in the Constitution or not, you have to do the kind of work in order to move us in that direction toward ground zero. Because of the implications, again, I want to stress the point. This is important to do because of what it does to our economy. It gives us the kind of economic growth, the stability, the lower interest rates that allow for businesses to borrow and expand and put people to work. That is the effect of a balanced budget. 
So there has been a good record here now. We are going in the right direction for the first time in years. The challenge for all of us here, regardless of party or ideology or some label that someone wants to put on someone, is to work together to see to it that we achieve those desired goals stated in this chart. 
None of us can predict, obviously, what is going to happen next week, tomorrow, or, for that matter, next month, next year that might disrupt our ability to move in this direction. That is one of the major reasons I have such reluctance about writing into the Constitution an economic theory that could end up being highly disruptive toward our ultimate goals as a nation. 
As someone suggested--I think my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, the other day, Mr. President, in talking about the proposed amendment. He suggested to a group of us that if we had any hesitation about whether or not this particular amendment belonged in the Constitution--and I have made a similar 
recommendation to people in my own home State--to take out 20 minutes or a half-hour, which is all you need, to read the Constitution of the United States. It is an incredible document in its simplicity and directives. 
Then, if you would, after you read the Constitution of the United States, pick up and read this amendment and ask yourself the simple question: Does this language in this amendment, putting aside the implications of it, but does this language in this amendment belong in this document, this organic law of our country, which represents the timeless principles--the timeless principles--that we embrace as a people? 
Nothing in the Constitution is contemporary in the sense that it deals with a present-day problem, except to the extent that human nature constantly raises issues that need to be addressed and protected by the Constitution. But we have historically stayed away from dealing with the issue of the day in the Constitution. 
I urge again that we consider what the implications would be of taking language which deals with economic theory, which is the contemporary issue of the day, and enshrining it in the organic law of the country, in such a way that I think we do an injustice to that document. Also, we run the risk, as I hope my colleagues will appreciate, of making it far more difficult in many ways for us to achieve the kind of economic opportunity, the job creation, the stability that is the underlying goal behind the entire discussion of whether or not we ought to have a constitutional amendment that balances the budget and does what we are presently on the right path toward achieving and that the Congresses in the years ahead will have to grapple with itself, as it deals with the issues of its day. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that Members, and others who may be in doubt about what this debate is all about, that they might take the time to read, as I say, both the Constitution and the amendment and ask themselves the question that Senator Conrad of North Dakota posed to us the other day, as to whether or not those particular words belong in the Constitution. 
Mr. President, other issues have been raised over the past number of days, and more will be raised next week, which are posed by this amendment. 
One of the issues that I will be raising has to do with the issue of national security. Again, the Presiding Officer is someone who is no stranger to these issues as a new Member of this body and he has a distinguished record in serving our country. I commend him for it. 
One of my concerns here is that the amendment would seem to indicate that we could not expend resources on a national security problem unless there was a declaration of war. As my colleagues are certainly aware, it has been many a year since we declared war despite the fact that we have had many conflicts in which American men and women have lost their lives. My concern would be that, given how difficult that can be, given the nature of the world in which we live today, declarations of war may be harder to achieve. 
This could be a matter for a separate discussion, the whole issue of the role of Congress and the war powers resolutions which we have debated extensively here over the years. But I can imagine, as I am sure the Presiding Officer could, situations that would not warrant necessarily a declaration of war, and yet it may be critically important that the United States respond because the national interest of the country is at stake, and yet we find ourselves engaged in such a debate where we have to first declare war before a President might be able to act and get the necessary funds. 
That is the kind of problem I see posed by the well-intended authors of this amendment, to create situations that could pose serious problems for our country. I have drafted an amendment and I have asked people to look at it. It may be an amendment that can be agreed to. It seems to me that we ought to be able to respond to situations without tying ourselves into long legislative knots around here. It may be absolutely critical that the Chief 
Executive, the Commander in Chief of this country be able to respond to a situation without getting bogged down in what could be a partisan battle, for whatever reason, and put in jeopardy the lives of American men and women or put in jeopardy the interests of our country. We could find ourselves hamstrung by a problem in the constitutional amendment that its authors never intended, but in the years to come could occur. 
So that is one issue that I find particularly troublesome about the balanced budget amendment. I urge again my colleagues to review and look at it. 
Another issue was raised by our colleagues from California, Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. Unfortunately, their State, maybe more so than any other in recent years, has been plagued by one disaster after another, natural disasters in most cases, where they have needed additional attention and resources. There seems to be little or no provision to respond to those situations again without having to go through the tremendous gyrations of developing some support. 
California is a big State. They have more than 50 Members of Congress in the House. They have the same number of Senators we have. What if you come from a smaller State that does not have the same kind of political clout that California might bring to a situation, where they need those extra dollars? Are we going to be able to respond? A legitimate issue is raised, Mr. President, by the language of this amendment, this constitutional amendment, that would make it extremely difficult for the Congress to respond to natural disasters that could hit any State in this country. 
Again, that is another reason that I think my colleagues ought to examine carefully some proposals that will be offered and, I would say, ultimately to step away from what I consider to be sort of a bumper-sticker approach to an issue that deserves far greater work and diligence than merely writing into the Constitution language that could make our job as legislators far more difficult in responding to the needs of our Nation. 
Mr. President, I will not take a great deal of time here today. I merely wanted to rise to indicate once again that we are on the right track. I think we are going in the right direction in dealing with the issue of getting our budgetary house in order. That is what we are going to have to do year in and year out, to see to it that we have the ability to respond. 
I am not old enough to remember the Great Depression, and I am confident the Presiding Officer is not either, but there are people certainly who will read this Record who are listening to what we are saying who remember the 1930's. I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for that Congress and that Chief Executive Officer. In the Northeast, in my State of Connecticut, and the Midwest was particularly hard hit in those years, what would life have been like in a Connecticut or Nebraska if we had been hit as we were with that Great Depression and faced with the tremendous need to provide resources to people in our States. We ought to be very thankful that we do not have national depressions. We have taken enough steps over the years to avoid the kind of difficulties that can sweep across a nation. 
Mr. President, I am sure the President is aware of this, my State, over the last 4, 5, 6, or 7 years, has been very hard hit economically. We have historically been called the Provision State, dating back to the Revolutionary War, and we are proud of it. The builders of helicopters, and jet engines at Pratt & Whitney, and submarines and electric boats, radar systems at Norden, we have a long history. The end of the cold war, the recession and the real estate collapse all hit my small State very hard. It has been very, very difficult for us to get back on our feet. Luckily, these economic troubles did not sweep across the country. Most parts of the country have done well. What am I to do in my State because of its unique problems? We need some particular help in responding to the needs of our people. 
What worries me is that we may not have national depressions, but we could have regional depressions. Will there be enough votes in these bodies to have supermajorities to provide the resources that specific regions of the country need? It could be an agricultural problem that hits--possibly bad crop seasons. I know the people of my State have been sympathetic in the past in responding when that has occurred. They are consumers of the food that is produced in this country. But natural disasters can hit. People can be literally wiped out in a matter of weeks. How do we respond? Should we respond? Is every State that does not have the same interests going to vote accordingly? 
Again, hamstrung by a constitutional amendment, it would make it difficult for us to use common sense and respond. That is troublesome to me, to put it mildly. For those reasons and others, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to move away from this particular debate. If the issue was we needed to get the attention of some reluctant Members of Congress--and I happen to believe there were some who were not serious enough about this issue. I go back to the days of the early 1980's. As an original sponsor of the Gramm-Rudman proposal, I think it could have worked had we not had a bunch of loopholes. Back in 1982 or 1983, I offered a pay-as-you-go budget, Mr. President, requiring that for every single expenditure there had to be resource to pay for it--every single expenditure. Had we adopted a pay-as-you-go in 1982, we would have been in balance 11 years ago, in 1986. I only got 22 votes on the floor of this Chamber in 1982 on that proposal. 
I take very seriously this debate about getting this budget in balance and moving in the right direction, but I again argue, as I did at the outset, it is work. It is not easy. Everybody has to go back to their constituencies and explain why everyone has to share in this responsibility. Merely taking out a chisel and etching into the organic law of this country the conclusion of a proposal of balancing the budget does not get us there, and it does raise serious, serious questions about other weighty matters that this Nation must come to terms with from time to time. 
In my view, it places them in jeopardy, and particularly at a time when it seems to me that we are on the right track, moving in the right direction. I do not understand why we would place in jeopardy other vitally important issues when, in fact, we are achieving, I think all would agree, the goals stated by those who strongly endorse this constitutional amendment. 
In addition the constant inflexibility in our budgetary decisionmaking process could have a disastrous impact on the business community. The private sector expects order and consistency in our economic policy. What's more, they rely on the Federal Government for our support and assistance in myriad ways. 
Whether it's the research and experimentation tax credit, our aggressive advocacy for American exporters, or the vital statistics and information published by Federal agencies, the private sector receives crucial support from the Federal Government. However, passage of this amendment could threaten to create a frantic rush, year in and year out, for the savings necessary for bringing the budget into constitutional compliance. In that sort of an environment, no Federal program would be safe. Business leaders would be unable to plan ahead, not knowing what programs will be funded or cut from year to year. An R&E tax credit that is constantly in jeopardy of being canceled is of little benefit to American business. 
Contrary to the rhetoric of those who support this amendment, American businesses will suffer if they are forced to operate in the looming shadow of tax increases or potential cuts in important programs. What's more, under the requirements of a balanced budget amendment the Congress would be forced to reorder our budgetary priorities every fiscal year. There'd be no rhyme or reason to what we cut and what we fund, because our decisions would be based on short-term economic factors. Long-term considerations would simply go by the wayside. By almost any standard, the balanced budget amendment is bad economic policy. But, it would have even worse and more far-reaching constitutional implications. Passage of this amendment risks allowing direct judicial involvement in the enforcement of a balanced budget requirement. 
If for whatever reason, the Congress was unable to achieve either a balanced budget or get 60 votes to waive the requirement for such, then the Federal judiciary could be forced to make critical decisions on budgetary allocations. I must say, I find it quite interesting that many of the same people who complain about so-called judicial activism are seeking to pass an amendment that would thrust the judiciary directly into our budgetary discussions. Theoretically, judges could order the Government to stop Social Security checks from being sent out, cut Federal spending, or even raise taxes. Additionally, to those who complain about a clogged court system, we could see a significant rise in litigation by either Members of Congress or private citizens hurt by spending cuts mandated by this amendment. 
For the Congress to go along with such a proposal represents an abdication of our responsibilities as legislators. The Constitution mandates very clearly that the legislative and executive branches must posses sole responsibility for fiscal policy. Yet, this amendment would fundamentally transform our constitutional system of checks and balances by placing the judiciary in an unheard of position--making budgetary decisions. 
This contravenes the most sacrosanct notions of constitutional integrity--our system of checks and balances and division of authority among the three branches of government. And it would debase the Constitution by involving it directly in economic decision making. This constitutional amendment would place what is fundamentally a fiscal policy into our organic law. 
Again, I urge all my colleagues to read the Constitution before they cast their vote. Look at the sorts of amendments that have been enacted. At their core, they deal almost universally with issues of social policy and the functioning of our democratic institutions--not with economic policy. But, this amendment would change that legacy. And I believe it could begin a disquieting process of including what is basically statutory language into our national Constitution. There can be little doubt that we face a momentous decision. 
Changing the Constitution is not like adopting a simple statute that can be modified or repealed somewhere down the road. The fact is, amending the Constitution is one of the most sacred duties of our role as national leaders. Indeed, the language we insert into the Constitution is timeless. And it will likely stay there long after all of us leave this Earth. However, I worry that the fundamental, hallowed nature of our Constitution is being lost on my colleagues. 
The last Congress advocated one of the most sweeping rewrites of the U.S. Constitution since the Bill of Rights. And I worry that this Congress will continue this troubling precedent. In the 104th Congress, amendments were proposed requiring a supermajority for taxes, advocating terms limits, providing for a line-item veto, allowing school prayer, preventing unfunded mandates, criminalizing flag burning, and the list goes on. 
The Constitution is not a set of institutional guidelines to be amended by each new generation of leaders. Generation after generation will live with the consequences of our constitutional decisions. And while I realize that this amendment is incredibly popular among the American people, that should not be our determining factor. Amending the Constitution must not be based on the political currents of today, but the sacred principles on which our Nation was founded. There is a very good reason why, in the more than 200 years since this Nation adopted the Constitution, we have seen fit to amend it only 27 times--27 times in more than 200 years. In fact, in those 200 or so years, there've been approximately 11,000 proposed amendments to the Constitution. Only 33 passed the Congress. And the Bill of Rights notwithstanding, only 17 are now part of the Constitution. What's more, amending the Constitution remains an incredibly difficult task. 
Two-thirds of the Congress, and three-fourths of the State legislatures must agree before we change the law of the land. Our Founding Fathers made clear that amending the Constitution would not be an easy or brazen decision. As Henry Clay said 145 years ago, `The Constitution of the United States was made not merely for the generation that then existed, but for posterity--unlimited, undefined, endless, perpetual posterity.' 
These are not idle words. The Constitution is sacred parchment--our guiding force for more than 200 years of democratic rule and a beacon for millions around the world who yearn for the dignity that freedom and democracy bestows. In my view, this document remains one of the greatest political and democratic accomplishments in human history and the amending of it must not be a rash or impetuous act. We all agree on the need for balancing the budget, but this amendment is the wrong way to go about doing it. If we are to really bring our fiscal house in order; if we are to guarantee to future generations that they will not be burdened with our debts; if we are to balance the budget in a fair and equitable manner, then let us reject this amendment and instead roll up our shirt sleeves and get down to the task of making the tough choices to truly balance the budget. 
I thank the majority leader for making this possible. I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, all of us in this country were deeply saddened by the tragic death of Pamela Harriman in Paris a few days ago. Regardless of party or political persuasion, this was a remarkable woman who spent a lifetime, from the basement of 10 Downing Street with that most revered of leaders of the 20th century, Sir Winston Churchill, to representing the United States in the Embassy in Paris. Hers was a remarkable life in many ways. 
As we have been reading about the legend of Pamela Harriman over the past few days not enough attention, in my view, is being paid to her profound legacy to this country. Most of us--I think all of us, maybe with some exception in this Chamber--were born in this country. We did not make the choice to be Americans. We were fortunate enough that our parents or grandparents or great-grandparents came to this country, and we were the beneficiaries of those decisions. 
I have always thought it was somewhat different for people who made the choice, the conscious choice to become an American. Pamela Harriman made that choice to be an American and contributed mightily to this country. She was engaged in the political process. She was a partisan. And I say to my friends on the other side, I think that is healthy when people become engaged and not only have ideas and values and beliefs, but are willing to act on them. And for those of us who are Democrats, we will be eternally grateful for her support and her willingness to be engaged in the political life in this country. For people, regardless of political persuasion, she was a great individual who represented our country in Paris with great distinction. 
There was a column presented the other day, Mr. President, by Richard Holbrooke in the Washington Post which I think captured in many ways the feelings of many of us about Pamela Harriman's service.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, a third subject matter I raise here in morning business today is one that did not get national attention except for those who may have been interested. But I want to pay tribute to a neighbor of mine, Mr. President, a neighbor and a friend, a woman who truly revolutionized the way we speak and write in this country. Casey Miller is her name. 
Throughout her life, Casey Miller promoted and venerated the role of women in our society by fighting to eradicate gender-specific language from everyday speech. 
Postal worker, artisan, police officer, and restaurant server are just some of the words that enter the glossary of modern English because of Casey Miller. While many falsely see these words as political correctness gone awry, they in fact represent a genuine effort to place America's women on the same linguistic standing as men. 
Her book, `The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing' is still considered the standard reference guide on how to correctly utilize language in order to properly address and speak of women. Too often in everyday discussions we use the words `man,' `men,' and `he,' as if they were interchangeable for all people. But these words only describe the role of the male gender and they demean to many women the significant position of women in our society. 
As the English novelist Thomas Hardy once said, `It is difficult for a woman to define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men to express theirs.' The fact is that `the man on the street' may be the woman with a strong opinion. Things that are `man-made' are often built by women. The `man of the house' is by no means always a man. And the `land where our fathers died' is the same land of our mothers. 
Through Casey Miller's writings, more and more Americans became aware of the implicit discrimination in our language and the distinct individuality of women in our society. Though she was not a household name, Mr. President, for most Americans, her impact on the way we write and speak has been profound. For all of her efforts she deserves the appreciation of women and men across this country of ours. 
Besides her groundbreaking work on behalf of women, Casey Miller was an active and vital participant in humanitarian and philanthropic causes. 
Through Childreach, the U.S. branch of Planned Parenthood International, Ms. Miller served as a foster parent for dozens of children in poor and disadvantaged countries. What is more, she shared her good fortune with others, generously donated to her alma mater Smith College, the NAACP, and the Humane Society. 
On a personal level I rise here, Mr. President, to talk about Casey Miller who passed away a number of days ago not just because she was a pioneer in the feminist movement, served our country in uniform in previous conflicts, but she was a dear friend, and she happens to have been my next door neighbor in Connecticut. More than just being an activist and someone who made a significant contribution through a particular avenue that she sought, she was a wonderful, wonderful, friend. I cannot tell you the countless breakfasts, lunches, and dinners, so lively across the lawn. I could spend an evening with Casey Miller and Kate Swift, her lifetime friend and partner. 
For millions of us across the country, Casey Miller has had an impact--you may not know her name--for the way we speak today, for the changes that have occurred. Even in our own legislative body Casey Miller made a significant contribution. 
Mr. President, I just wanted to rise this morning and pay tribute to my neighbor. I will miss her very, very much. She was a wonderful friend, a great person, an individual who proved, once again, that one person can truly make a difference in our society.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the nomination of Andrew Cuomo for the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. 
Those of us who have worked closely with Andrew Cuomo over the years, and have witnessed his remarkable range of skills, know that he will become an outstanding leader for the Department. He has a remarkable record of achievement in both the public and private sectors. 
I commend President Clinton for selecting him to help our communities prepare for the next century. 
For a number of years, Andrew Cuomo worked on the frontlines of community development. Although he could have lived a comfortable life as a partner at an established law firm, he answered the call to public service. In 1986, he started an organization called HELP, that worked to improve the lives of homeless people. 
Under his leadership, HELP grew to 500 employees, and used its $30 million annual budget to build more than 120 million dollars worth of housing and help thousands of homeless people move off the streets. 
While developing HELP, Andrew Cuomo realized that it was not enough to simply build housing. Although shelter was a key part of the formula for success, homeless people could not move to productive lives without additional support. Consequently, HELP also provided opportunities designed to make the homeless self-sufficient, including substance abuse treatment, mental health care, job training, education, and child care. 
This experience at the local level, the hands-on effort to build housing and transform lives, gave Andrew Cuomo invaluable experience. He met a payroll. He dealt with Government bureaucracies. And he learned that public-private partnerships will only work if everyone performs efficiently. 
Andrew Cuomo brought those lessons to HUD, when he was confirmed as Assistant Secretary of Community Planning and Development in 1993. His consolidated planning effort merged 12 bureaucratic processes into a streamlined system. 
This system reduced paperwork and redtape. Now communities can use Government programs more effectively. We need more efforts like this--where the Federal Government is not the problem, but part of the solution. 
Additionally, Andrew Cuomo helped make HUD's homeless programs work better. With the knowledge gained from his experience at HELP, he implemented a new continuum of care strategy. This strategy addresses each part of the homeless problem--from the emergency situation where someone is sleeping on the street, to the drug and alcohol problems that must be treated when a person is in transitional housing, to the final job-training efforts that are necessary to help someone become a productive and member of society. 
This comprehensive approach to complex problems will be critical in the years ahead. Welfare reform will have a dramatic effect on cities across this country. We must all work to ensure that efforts to solve one problem do not create new problems. 
In the years ahead, we must do much more to rebuild our cities. Too many families are trapped by poverty and despair. We have to free their talents with better educational and job-training opportunities. And most importantly, we must help people find work, because a good-paying job--and the respect and self-esteem that come with it--provides the foundation for a better life. 
Andrew Cuomo's dedicated efforts to expand economic opportunity will play a critical role in helping to meet this challenge. At HUD, he helped strengthen job creation tools, including the Economic Development Initiative which provides low-interest loans to cities. With these tools, communities have leveraged over $8 billion from private sources, and helped put thousands of Americans to work. 
In short, Andrew Cuomo offers the talent, dedication, and leadership that HUD needs to help communities meet the challenges of the next century. 
During the Banking Committee hearing on his nomination, he demonstrated a keen understanding of the problems facing HUD, including staffing issues, expiring section 8 contracts, and the need to revitalize our cities. I am confident he will be an outstanding Secretary, and I urge my colleagues to support his nomination. 
Before closing, I would also like to commend the outgoing Secretary, Henry Cisneros, for his outstanding work. When he took the reins back in 1993, the future of HUD looked bleak. The Department was still struggling to recover from years of corruption, mismanagement, and low morale. The turnaround has been remarkable. 
Under the leadership of Secretary Cisneros, HUD is now a stronger partner in the national effort to build better communities. With a smaller work force, HUD is running more efficiently. Around the country, people are regaining confidence in the department. 
The changes in public housing are a good example of the changes. Every Member of this body knows how badly conditions had deteriorated in some public housing developments. 
I have been through too many buildings that were covered with graffiti, where the ceilings and walls were falling apart, and where families were afraid to go out after dark because gangs controlled the neighborhood. 
Secretary Cisneros saw this national disgrace, and took action. HUD is well on its way to tearing down 100,000 units of decayed and dangerous housing. Working with the resilient residents who want to build a better neighborhood, he has brought not only better living conditions, but a sense of hope to families across this Nation. 
In my home State of Connecticut, these efforts are helping to transform urban neighborhoods. At the Charter Oak Terrace development in Hartford, residents will soon have better housing, educational programs, and job opportunities. In New Haven, the redevelopment of the Elm Haven apartments will also help lift families out of poverty. 
Working together, Henry Cisneros and Andrew Cuomo have already accomplished a great deal. With that experience, Andrew Cuomo will hit the ground running and build upon that record of success. I look forward to working with him in the years ahead. 
Let me say in summation for those of us who have worked with and known Andrew Cuomo, this is going to be a very fine appointment. He understands the agency now, having been there for 3 years in a major capacity. He knows the personnel. He has demonstrated abilities, as I mentioned, in developing the kind of efficiencies in HUD that are absolutely critical. 
My hope is that the housing issues and related subject matters will once again become what they were initially, and that is a bipartisan subject. When housing initiatives were identified and supported back in the late 1940's, it was through the efforts of Republicans and Democrats who said that decent, affordable shelter ought not to be something that divides people based on politics or party. I think it is vitally important we get back to that. 
We have a wonderful opportunity, in my view, with the chairman of the committee, Senator D'Amato, and the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, who understand these issues, and a very fine staff that wants to work on them. The fact that Andrew Cuomo comes from New York, the home State of the chairman of the committee, can only strengthen the excellent relationship between the Senate Banking Committee and HUD. I look forward to a new era of cooperation and bipartisanship in seeing to it that decent, affordable shelter and economic development are given the attention they deserve. 
With that in mind, I am delighted to join my colleague from New York and my colleague from Maryland and others in strongly endorsing the nomination of Andrew Cuomo to be the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with a great sense of sadness that I rise today to pay tribute to a man who epitomized personal and political courage and a fervent commitment to public service--Senator Paul Tsongas. 
Paul and I both came to Congress in 1974, as part of the so-called Watergate class and we were together in the Senate from 1981 to 1984. In all that time, while we didn't always see eye to eye on every issue, our deep friendship and appreciation for each other never diminished. 
Throughout his entire life, Paul Tsongas built on the strong belief in public service that he learned while a Peace Corps volunteer in Ethiopia and country director in the West Indies. 
Whether it was in his hometown of Lowell, MA, where he served as a city councilor; or as a one-term Senator, who pushed through what President Carter called the most important conservation legislation of the century, the Alaska Lands Act of 1980; or even as a Presidential candidate and later cochairman of the Concord Coalition, preaching the gospel of a balanced budget, Paul Tsongas always had the best interests of his fellow citizens in mind. 
In all the time I knew him, Paul Tsongas never wavered from the firmly held beliefs and principles that guided his public and private life. What is more, Paul was never afraid to speak his mind or voice an opinion, no matter how controversial or unpopular. 
The courage was never more evident than in his hard fought battle to conquer the health problems that plagued him for more than a decade and eventually took his life. When Paul was diagnosed with cancer in 1983, he gave up what was then a promising political career in the U.S. Senate to undergo radical treatment and rehabilitation. 
After his amazing recovery, Paul stayed close to his family arguing that no man ever died wishing he'd spent more time with his business. 
But the pull of the arena was too strong for Paul Tsongas and after being cleared by doctors to resume his political career he began what most observers termed a futile campaign to unseat George Bush. 
But, what he lacked in fiery oratory he made up for with a commonsense agenda that appealed to Democrats across the country. While Paul failed to gain the Democratic nomination he never lost his dignity or the trademark dry wit that always characterized him. 
Teddy Roosevelt once said that of public service `It is not the critic that counts. * * * The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marked by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasm and great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best, knows in the end the triumph of high achievement; and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.' 
Paul Tsongas knew well both the joys of victory and the anguish of defeat. No matter what adversity befell him, be it personal or political, he never paused from his tireless efforts to improve the world around him. For all those in the Senate and throughout the country who valued his wise counsel and commitment to public service he will be sorely missed. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Niki and his three daughters Ashley, Katina, and Molly. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we do a great deal of important business here in the U.S. Senate, but much of it seems arcane and distant from the lives of American families. But last evening, with the airing of a CBS made for TV movie, `A Child's Wish,' we had a particularly moving example of the power we have to make a positive difference in the lives of America's families. I don't know how many of my colleagues had a chance to see it. It was a fictional story based on the true life experiences of two families impacted by the Family and Medical Leave Act signed into law by President Clinton in 1993. 
Dixie Yandle was one of those children. I believe she came from North Carolina, I say to my colleague from North Carolina. Dixie's father lost his job during her struggle with cancer as he sought to spend more time with her. She and her parents testified in fact before the Congress about the need for family medical leave legislation so that what happened to them would not happen to the other parents. 
The second child, Melissa Weaver, was also diagnosed with cancer that ultimately proved to be fatal. But due to the Family and Leave Act the family was able to spend the last days of her life together. Melissa's story is one of many that I heard in 1994 during a series of public hearings of the Commission on Family and Medical Leave on the impact of the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
`A Child's Wish' took the lives of these two children and wove them together to dramatize how important the Family and Medical Leave Act is and how meaningful it is to families. I am hopeful that this movie may have helped a lot of people understand the legislation better. 
Today, at a time when many Americans are deeply cynical toward the work we do here in Washington, the family and medical leave stands in sharp contrast. 
Not only is this legislation making a real difference in the lives of the American people, but it has been judged by a bipartisan commission to be an unqualified success. 
The Family and Medical Leave Act fulfilled a genuine need among America's working families to take leave in times of medical and family need. 
With this legislation we established in law a basic standard of decency toward America's families. 
Eligible employees were guaranteed 12 weeks of unpaid leave during times of genuine family need--such as a birth or adoption, placement of a foster child, or in times of serious medical emergency for a child, spouse or parent. 
This minimal benefit--unpaid leave--is providing millions of workers and their families with vital assistance during times of crisis. 
Yet, even with the apparent success of the FMLA there is still more work to be done. 
Millions of Americans continue to face painful choices involving their competing responsibilities to family and work. 
Employees not covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act are still often told that they must choose between sick family members and their jobs. 
In fact today, 43 percent of private sector employees remain unprotected by the Family and Medical Leave Act because their employer does not meet the current 50 or more employee threshold. 
This legislation I introduce today--the Family and Medical Leave Fairness Act of 1997--will extend the Family and Medical Leave Act to millions of Americans who remain uncovered. 
This bill would lower the threshold to include coverage for companies with 25 or more workers. 
This small step would provide 13 million additional workers with the protection of the Family and Medical Leave Act--raising the total percentage of the private sector work force covered by the FMLA to 71 percent. 
In my view, these workers deserve the same job security in times of family and medical emergency that workers in lager companies receive from the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
With this legislation they will receive it. 
Now, for those of my colleagues who still harbor doubts about the success of the Family and Medical Leave Act I strongly urge them to examine a recent bipartisan report that documents the positive impact of this legislation. 
When the bill was passed in 1993, provisions in the legislation established a commission to examine the impact of the act on workers and businesses. 
The Family and Medical Leave Commission's analysis spanned 2 1/2 years. 
It included independent research and field hearings across the country to learn first hand about the act's impact from individuals and the business community. 
The report's conclusions are clear--the Family and Medical Leave Act is helping to expand opportunities for working Americans while at the same time not placing any undue burden on employers. 
According to the Commission's final report, the Family and Medical Leave Act represents `A significant step in helping a larger cross-section of working Americans meet their medical and family care giving needs while still maintaining their jobs and economic security.' 
Due to this legislation, Americans now possess greater opportunities to keep their health benefits, maintain job security, and take longer leaves for a greater number of reasons. 
In fact, according to the bipartisan commission--12 million workers took job-protected leave for reasons covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act during the 18 months of its study. 
But, not only are American workers reaping the benefits. The law is working for American business as well. In fact, the conclusions of the bipartisan report are a far cry from the concerns that were voiced when this law was being considered in Congress. 
The vast majority of businesses--over 94 percent--report little to no additional costs associated with the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
More than 92 percent reported no noticeable effect on profitability. 
And nearly 96 percent reported no noticeable effect on business growth. 
Additionally, 83 percent of employers reported no noticeable impact on employee productivity. 
In fact, 12.6 percent actually reported a positive effect on employee productivity from the Family and Medical Leave Act, twice as many as reported a negative effect. 
And not only did employers report that compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act was relatively easy and of minimal cost, but worksites with a small number of employees generally reported greater ease of administration and even smaller costs than large worksites. 
Today, I introduce this legislation with the hope and expectation that we can put aside our political differences and build on the success of the Family and Medical Leave Act. Last November, the American people gave us a mandate--a mandate for good governance. 
The Family and Medical Leave represents the fulfillment of this goal and I urge all my colleagues to join with me in supporting this critically important legislation for America's working families. 
I think the fact that the law has been working so well has made a sufficient difference in people's lives in moments of crises. The fact that people are able to be there particularly when a child is dying, so that you have the love of parents and a family coming together and you don't have to choose between that job and your family is a wonderful thing. It has made such a difference in people's lives. 
There have been many issues dealt with in this body over 16 years, and there is none that I am more proud of than the day that this body voted to support the family and medical leave legislation, and when President Clinton signed it into law. 
I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Daschle, Senator Kennedy, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Kerry. Mr. President, I can't miss the opportunity to briefly say that a friend of mine who is here from Pennsylvania, who I know is going to speak on the nomination of Madeleine Albright, but the body should know that the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, was an invaluable ally in that effort beginning in the first day we arrived in the Senate some 16 years ago. We formed a caucus on children's needs. I thank him for his efforts over the years in that regard.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier today on the third day of the 105th Congress, we cast a historic ballot--on behalf of the first woman to be confirmed as Secretary of State in our Nation's proud history. 
But, as we prepare to usher in Madeleine Albright as America's new Secretary of State, I wanted to take this opportunity to voice my strong support for the pending resolution that honors the man whose shoes she will soon be filling--Warren Christopher. 
Over the past 4 years, Warren Christopher provided the steadying hand and reservoir of experience that helped President Clinton successfully weave his way through the minefield of international diplomacy. 
Through these efforts, he earned a revered statute--as the elder statesman of the President's Cabinet. 
In the more than 200-year history of our Republic, no Secretary of State traveled more miles in the pursuit of democracy, open markets, and the promotion of American international interests than Warren Christopher. From Beijing to Buenos Aires, Johannesburg to Jakarta, and Mali to Moscow, no journey was too far and no effort unworthy of his personal diplomacy. 
In the Middle East, his diplomatic endeavors paved the way for the first steps toward reconciliation and cooperation in the age-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. 
Generations from now, Bosnians, Serbs, and Croats will look back with fondness and appreciation at his tireless efforts to bring the warring parties together at Dayton. In fact, at Dayton, after the bags were packed and the participants had all but given up, it was Warren Christopher who convinced all sides that a peaceful resolution was the only true hope for the Balkans. 
Under his watch, the Haitian people were able to finally cast off the evils of dictatorship for the fruits of democracy. The Korean Peninsula took its first tentative steps toward limiting the development of nuclear weapons and curbing tensions in one of the cold war's last hotspots. 
What's more, over the past 4 years--with the strong support of Warren Christopher and the Clinton administration, democracy spread its wings across every corner of the globe. 
Today in Latin America every nation but one is a full-fledged democracy. In Russia, 70 years of totalitarian rule are giving way to free elections and open markets. And in Africa, a region scarred for so long by war, famine, and political instability, the seeds of democracy are beginning to take root. 
However, for all the accomplishments that Warren Christopher achieved overseas, we must not forget the impact of his impressive contributions here at home. Besides helping to make America more secure and protecting our vital national interests, Warren Christopher presided over a period of great economic liberalization--a period that brought greater prosperity and limitless economic opportunity to millions of Americans. 
Secretary Christopher built on the passage of NAFTA and GATT by working to create a framework for regional-wide trading blocs in all of Latin America and the Pacific rim. The result is increased opportunities for export, and new developing markets for American commerce. 
But, most of all, Warren Christopher brought a quiet dignity, grace, and gentle demeanor to his role as Secretary of State. 
At a time when public debate in our Nation is becoming coarser and more partisan, when style seems to take precedent over substance and when shrill voices garner more attention than quiet deliberation, Warren Christopher proved that you can still speak softly, yet carry a big stick. 
A recent editorial in his hometown Los Angeles Times by Tom Plate describes the traits that define Warren Christopher best: 
Extreme loyalty to friends and colleagues; a faith in the institutions of government and the Constitution; respect for careerists in the State Department as well as on his personal staff; discretion approaching squareness. 
These are the attributes that inspired him through four Democratic administrations and years of public service. What's more, they are virtues that every American should expect from their leaders. 
As he prepares to return to his beloved California with his wife, Marie, to spend more time with his children and grandchildren, I join all my colleagues in wishing him the best. 
What's more, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution honoring a man who in all his travels--from the Great Plains of Scranton, ND, to the corridors of power in Foggy Bottom--never lost his sense of dignity, grace, and conviction to principle.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Biden and also my colleague from North Carolina for his understanding. I also thank him and Senator Lott for the expeditious manner in which this nomination has been treated. Finally, I thank my colleagues on the committee as well, who engaged in a long day of testimony by Madeleine Albright, under an arrangement that allowed us to move this nomination out of our committee on the day of the inauguration. Now, it will allow us to vote here today in the full Senate. 
Mr. President, I believe that today's bipartisan cooperation on this nomination will help to forge the kind of working relationship between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that should make it easier to get the American people's business taken care of here in Washington. I commend the leaders of both sides of the aisle for their efforts in that regard. 
To be honest, Mr. President, reaching consensus on this nomination was not difficult at all. That's because the nominee we are considering today is so highly respected by everyone in the U.S. Congress--by Democrats and Republicans, liberals, moderates, and conservatives. 
During her nomination hearing on January 8, Ambassador Albright demonstrated a profound understanding of the foreign policy issues confronting the United States as we prepare to enter the 21st century. In her opening statement on that day, she laid out very effectively, in my view, and succinctly why all Americans should care about foreign policy. I would like to quote her: 
Do not doubt,-- 
Speaking of foreign policy interests. Those interests are not geopolitical abstractions, they are real. 
It matters to our children whether they grow up in a world where the dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction have been minimized or allowed to run out of control. 
It matters to our families whether illegal drugs continue to pour into our neighborhoods from overseas. 
It matters to Americans who travel abroad or go about their daily business at home whether the scourge of international terrorism is reduced. 
It matters to our workers and business people whether they will be unfairly forced to compete against companies that violate fair labor standards, despoil the environment or gain contracts not through competition but corruption. 
And it matters to us all whether through inattention or indifference, we allow small wars to grow into large ones that put our safety and freedom at risk. 
Mr. President, I believe that summarizes very well why what happens outside of our borders is important to each and every American. 
I know that time is limited and many of my colleagues wish to speak on this issue as well. So I will just cover some brief points here, if I can. I certainly would not want to allow the time to pass without making some personal observations about Madeleine Albright. 
Obviously, Ambassador Albright's nomination is historic for a number of reasons, and those reasons have been outlined by the 
chairman of the committee, the Senator from North Carolina, as well as others, over the last several hours. She will be the first woman to hold the position of Secretary of State. Without a doubt, Madeleine is eminently qualified to discharge the duties of this office. She has the expertise, academic background, and leadership qualities that will make her an excellent Secretary of State. I may also point out, Mr. President, that Madeleine Albright speaks, I believe, four or five languages fluently--which will be a first, I think, for anyone to ever hold this position--including her native language of Czech, as well as Russian, Polish, French, and obviously English. This will provide an invaluable tool for the United States, to have a Secretary of State with such a proficient ability to communicate with leaders throughout the world. 
I have known Ambassador Albright for many years. Our families have been close. My brother, Tom, was a colleague of Madeleine's at Georgetown University for many years, where they both taught. 
Madeleine is also no stranger to the Congress and she keenly understands the need to return to a bipartisan consensus on American foreign policy. In fact, Mr. President, if I were asked what is the single-most important foreign policy issue facing this country today, I would say getting the Congress and the legislative branch to work together. I think that is No. 1. Every other issue you can mention is obviously important, but unless we figure out a way to return to a time when there was comity in the foreign policy agenda, it is going to be very difficult to deal with any foreign policy issue. 
I happen to think Ambassador Albright is eminently qualified because she knows all of this so well. We have dealt with her, we know of her and her competence, and we have confidence in her. That is a very important step in allowing us to work together on behalf of shared goals. I've heard my chairman speak about this subject matter and I have a great deal of confidence that we are going to have great success under his leadership and the leadership of Ambassador Albright in that regard. 
Madeleine has also worked closely with both Chambers over the past 4 years as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations. She has been a voice of wisdom and reason at the United Nations during the course of the many debates that have occurred there--on Bosnia, on Iraq, on Haiti, on Cuba, and on the need for institutional reform within that international body. 
Why has Madeleine been so effective at representing U.S. interests? Perhaps because her own life story, which may not be well known to many people, is the epitome of what makes this country great. 
Becoming the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations was something of a homecoming for Ambassador Albright. She had, after all, been at the United Nations once before. Madeleine first came to the United States in 1948, at the age of 11, when her father was appointed as the Czech Ambassador to the United Nations. 
Little did her family realize at that time that their stay in the United States would be more than the usual ambassadorial rotation. Soon after their arrival, the free Czechoslovakia they had left behind was under the grip of totalitarian rule. It had fallen to the dictatorship of communism. 
I happen to know about that so well, because during that very brief time when Czechoslovakia was a free government, my father was fortunate to receive the Order of the White Lion, which was the highest honor that Czechoslovakia could give to a non-Czech, at the end of World War II. We still prize it as one of my father's most memorable moments in his life. So from that relationship, my family got to know Madeleine's family. 
It is perhaps because of these unique personal experiences that Ambassador Albright has been such an effective U.S. spokesperson at the United Nations. Whatever the topic, Madeleine is able to speak out passionately--from the heart--about the importance of democracy and respect for human rights across the globe. 
Even before going to the United Nations, Ambassador Albright already had a distinguished career of public service and academic achievement. She is a graduate of Wellesley College and Columbia University. She was a fellow at both the Woodrow Wilson Center and the Center for Strategic and International Studies. As I mentioned earlier, she was a professor of international relations at Georgetown University and president of the Center for National Policy. 
Her public service is equally distinguished--as a staff member to the late Senator Edmund Muskie, then as a member of the National Security Council in the Carter administration and most recently Ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. President, I believe the same qualities that made her so effective in these positions will make her particularly effective as the next Secretary of State. 
Heads of state and foreign ministries around the globe already know that our next Secretary of State is highly respected in the United States and internationally and that she can go toe to toe with the most seasoned diplomats and foreign leaders. But, they should also know that she has the full confidence of both the President and the U.S. Congress. 
Mr. President, Madeleine Albright is uniquely qualified, at this moment in history, to be America's voice abroad. I am confident that she will be a superb Secretary of State and I urge all to join me in supporting her nomination. 
I thank our colleague from Delaware and our chairman for moving this along. This is the way we ought to be able to do business around here. I commend him and thank the majority leader, as well.

Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Working Families Child Care Act of 1997. 
Mr. President, balancing the daunting responsibilities of work with the responsibilities of raising children is always a difficult task. It is especially challenging when so many parents today are working outside the home and are forced to depend on child care. 
Not surprisingly, these challenges are especially acute for low income, working families. In fact according to a national child care study, when compared to all other income groups, the working poor are the least likely to receive assistance with child care costs--even though it consumes a disproportionate share of their income--24 percent, compared to 6 percent for middle income families. 
What's more, it's a constant struggle for low income families to remain self sufficient without child care assistance. In a survey of families on a waiting list in one community, it was found that of those paying for child care, 71 percent faced serious debt or bankruptcy. 
Currently, in 38 States and the District of Columbia the working poor are on waiting lists to receive child care. Georgia has 41,000 on its waiting list; Texas 36,000; Illinois 20,000; Alabama 20,000. Most of the States which don't have a waiting list either don't keep one, are expecting to create one in the future, or currently are experiencing a brief respite. 
In my own State of Connecticut, new openings for child care assistance were frozen in November 1993. When new slots became available, for only two days this past summer, 5,500 applications were received. 
During the last Congress, we intensely debated the issue of child care--in the larger context of welfare reform legislation. The original welfare legislation in January 1995 cut funds for child care and eliminated critically important health and safety standards. 
In the 104th Congress I continued to fight for child care, offering amendments to increase funding and ensure quality. While I disagreed with the final welfare reform bill, I am pleased that many of these amendments succeeded 
and that in the end, the final bill included child care funding of $14.2 billion over 6 years and restored rigorous health and safety standards. 
However, while the bill we passed made significant and crucial strides in providing child care for welfare recipients--there is still work to be done. 
The bill I am proposing today will address the issue of child care for low income working families and make it easier for them to access adequate child care assistance. 
First, this legislation restores $1.4 billion in child care funding. 
According to a recent CBO report, even if states meet the work requirements of the welfare bill they will still be short $1.4 billion for money needed to continue serving certain low income working families. These aren't new recipients we're talking about, but instead families who were receiving child care assistance prior to passage of welfare reform legislation. 
The legislation I am introducing today will prevent working parents from losing child care assistance simply as a result of the welfare reform bill. 
Second, it begins to address the shortage of assistance for working families, by raising the authorization for child care subsidies for low income working families from $1 billion per year to $2 billion per year. 
And finally, it authorizes $500 million per year through 2002 to help communities meet supply shortages in areas such as infant care and school age care. 
Even when subsidies are available, child care can be difficult to obtain. According to the National Academy of Sciences, there is `Consistent evidence of a relatively low supply of care for infants, for school age children, for children with disabilities and special health care needs and for parents with unconventional or shifting work hours.' 
What's more, a 1995 GAO study based in Michigan found a shortage of infant and special needs child care in inner cities and a shortage of all types of child care in rural areas. So, we're not simply talking about financial assistance for child care, but whether child care actually exists. 
This shortage of child care is a problem for both working families and welfare recipients who want to become self-sufficient. How can we expect someone to make the difficult transition from welfare to work when they cannot find an adequate provider for an infant or are forced to have a 6, 7 or 8 year old spend hours alone at home when the school day ends? 
This lack of supervision can have a devastating long-term impact. One study found that children who start to take care of themselves in elementary school are significantly more likely to report high use of alcohol by the eighth grade. Eighth graders left home alone for 11 or more hours a week report significantly greater use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana then children not left home alone. We know all this, and yet only one third of the schools in low income neighborhoods offer school age child care, compared with 52 percent in more affluent areas. 
For those struggling to make the difficult journey to self-sufficiency, the lack of available child care before 9, after 5, and on weekends can be an enormous problem. What's worse, such arrangements put the safety of a child in question. 
The reality is that nearly 1 in 5 full time workers--14.3 million--work nonstandard hours. More than 1 in 3 are women. However, only 10 percent of child care centers and 6 percent of family day care provide care on weekends. Yet one third of working mothers with incomes below poverty and one fourth of mothers with income above poverty, but below $25,000, work on weekends. 
An additional supply problem is that head start and other prekindergarten programs are part day and part year. As a result, they often do not meet the needs of parents who work full time. Less than 30 percent of Head Start programs operate on a full-time, full-year basis. 
Simply put, child care funds need to be available to make these programs accessible for working parents. In my view, we as a nation have a solemn commitment to guarantee that children will not be left to fend for themselves while their parents are working to put food on the table. 
Child care is one of the most important ingredients for helping poor working families achieve and maintain economic security. Like parents in any community and of any financial background, low income families need to know that when they go to work, their children will receive the care and assistance they need. 
The bill I am introducing today will make it easier for low income, working families to balance the responsibilities of work and caring for their children. I urge all my colleagues to join together in supporting this legislation--for the good of America's children.
