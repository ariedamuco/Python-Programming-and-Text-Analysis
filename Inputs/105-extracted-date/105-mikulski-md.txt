Ms. MIKULSKI. As the chairman knows, hepatitis C is the most common blood-borne infection in the United States. The CDC estimates that there are 4 million Americans--or 2 percent of the population--that are infected. Each year there are 10,000 deaths due to hepatitis C and the death total will increase to 30,000 a year unless something is done to intervene with the progression of this disease in the United States. Unfortunately, the vast majority of people infected with hepatitis C are not even aware that they are infected because the disease is `silent` without symptoms sometimes for decades. Meanwhile these infected individuals may be passing the disease on, causing new infections to occur each year. We need to break this cycle by helping individuals learn they have hepatitis C and by getting them to seek counseling, testing, and treatment of their infection and begin to understand the seriousness of this epidemic. 
Additional funds are needed to support both a targeted look back effort to reach the 300,000 Americans who have hepatitis C as a result of exposure to blood products prior to 1992, when blood was not adequately screened for hepatitis C and a general media campaign to alert other Americans infected by hepatitis C. These funds are needed to fund cooperative efforts of State and local health departments and national voluntary health agencies such as the American Liver Foundation to identify, educate, counsel, test and refer for treatment those infected. The efforts should be bolstered by a toll-free hotline to help provide information and counseling. In addition, since not everyone can afford private testing, some of these funds should be made available to public health agencies for clinic testing and other testing options, including FDA-approved telemedicine testing services. 
The chairman and the committee have some very strong report language focused on this issue and the chairman is well aware of this problem. I compliment him for the guidance he has given to the CDC on this issue. I have been informed by the CDC that $48 million is needed and at a minimum $16 million is needed just to begin to address this epidemic in fiscal year 1999. Can this amount be found within the totals recommended by the conferees?

Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Mr. President. 
I am really proud once again to come to the floor with my colleague, Senator Bond, to bring to the Senate's attention the 1999 VA-HUD conference report and urge that we move quickly to vote on and pass what I believe is a very solid report. This is a strong conference report, and I believe it is one which will be signed by the President of the United States. And why? Because it meets the day-to-day needs of the American people as well as the long-range needs of the United States of America. 
It provides a safety net for our seniors. It gets behind our kids. It invests in science and technology and makes our world safer. It meets compelling human needs and at the same time makes public investments in Federal Laboratories that will come up with the new ideas for the new products, for the new jobs, for the 21st century. 
Let's talk about a safety net for seniors. We have often said to our veterans that we are a grateful nation for the sacrifice that they have made in the wars, and many of them bear the permanent wounds of war. But I believe the way a grateful nation expresses its gratitude is not with words but with deeds. That is why I am so pleased that we are providing in the VA medical care account $17.3 billion to meet that need. This will ensure that our veterans will receive quality medical care and that whenever they enter a VA hospital or an outpatient clinic, promises made will be promises kept. 
At the same time, we provided $316 million for VA medical research. VA medical research is different from NIH research. Building on basic science, it actually does research in hands-on ways to improve clinical practice--both in acute care as well as in prevention and home health care. This means that this will focus on those diseases that ravage our veterans--like diabetes and like prostate cancer as well as the Gulf War Syndrome. 
In addition to what we have done for senior citizens in the veterans health care program, we also worked to make sure that there is a safety net for seniors in our housing for the elderly. Misguided budget cutters sent a budget to us cutting housing for the elderly by a half a billion dollars, and at the same time they wanted to convert those funds to vouchers. On a bipartisan basis, Senator Bond and I said that was absolutely unacceptable. 
First of all, the Housing for Elderly Program is one of the most popular programs within HUD. And it is often run by nonprofit organizations, many of whom are faith-based, like Catholic Charities and Associated Jewish Charities in my own State, not only taking taxpayers' dollars and adding housing for the elderly but value adding to that. That is why we restored that cut of a half-billion dollars, to make sure that the funds are there. 
We also rejected their approach to providing vouchers. Senator Bond and I really did not believe that an 80-year-old frail, elderly woman with her walker should be walking up and down the streets of St. Louis, MO, or Baltimore, MD, or any of our communities, trying to get into an apartment that might not meet the needs of the elderly, and certainly the frail elderly. 
So we got rid of the misguided budget cutting and also the poor policy thinking that went into it. We are challenging HUD, however, to come up with new thinking in their housing for the elderly to develop new approaches for our seniors, and particularly those that are aging in place. There will be a demonstration project run by Catholic Charities just to do that. 
At the same time, in this subcommittee, we showed our commitment to the next generation in terms of our children. Within the National Science Foundation account, we have increased the funding for the training of science teachers as well as expanding the informal science education programs to reach beyond the classroom to our children to encourage them to study math, science, and engineering. 
Also, we have added assistance for the historically black colleges, as well as ones serving Hispanic institutions, to develop important laboratory infrastructure so that they can modernize their facilities, so they can provide the best quality education available. 
In addition to our educational efforts in terms of our children, we also wanted to look out for their health. That is often in the Labor-HHS appropriation, but there is a secret here often in housing, in old housing in slum neighborhoods, which is that they are loaded with lead. Lead constitutes one of the biggest problems facing many of the children in my own hometown of Baltimore. And we have taken Federal dollars and increased the funding for our lead abatement program. 
Again, we have worked on a bipartisan basis. 
Scientists and physicians at Johns Hopkins point out when a child comes into Hopkins and his or her blood is loaded with lead, the very nature of detoxification is not only painful, but it often costs in the Medicaid budget thousands of dollars. The impact of lead not only can lead to death but severe impairment of intellectual ability. By getting the lead out of our housing and getting the lead out of our bureaucracy, we will make sure we get the lead out of our children. We are very pleased to have been able to do that. 
While we are looking now to the day-to-day needs of the American people, we know we have to invest in science and technology. Again, Senator Bond and I believe that public investments in science and technology will lead to the new ideas, the new products and the new jobs for the 21st century. That is why we have provided significant funding for critical science and research at the National Science Foundation and the National Space Agency. This legislation will provide $3.6 billion in the National Science Foundation account. This is an 8 percent overall increase in funding. 
The NSF has peer review programs focusing on developing cutting-edge science and technology. We want to, again, work to make sure that this money is used wisely. We believe that the National Science Foundation is on track. 
In addition to that, this appropriation provides $13.6 billion for the National Space Agency. It will spur technology development, as well as look for the origins of the universe. 
To my colleagues in the Senate and to those also watching, while we were working on the funding for NASA we recognized a great American hero, Senator John Glenn. At the request of his colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, we have renamed the NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland the `John Glenn Research Center,' which we think is an appropriate recognition. We thank the junior Senator from Ohio for making that request. 
While we are working on NASA, we have been troubled about the funding for the space station and also the failure of the Russian Government to deliver its promises. We have instructed NASA to take a look at how we are going to get value for taxpayers' dollars and how we are going to get technology for taxpayers' dollars. After rather firm conversations with the National Security Advisor of the United States, as well as the Administrator, we believe we have language in our appropriations that will help us get both value and technology for our cooperation in this effort. 
We are also working on a safe world. We have funded the Environmental Protection Agency to clean up our environment and also take those steps that are necessary to prevent increased environmental degradation. One of the efforts, of course, is in brownfields, which we hope will be a new tool to be able to clean up those contaminated areas and turn a brownfield into a `green field' for economic development. 
We continue to be troubled about the lack of an authorization for Superfund. We will fund Superfund at last year's level but we encourage the authorizers to be able to move ahead and pass an authorization. We have an additional $650 million included, contingent on a reauthorization by August 1. Those are the things we believe will truly be able to help clean up our environment and do preventive work. 
Certain aspects in this legislation regarding EPA are important to my home State of Maryland. In Maryland, we consider good environment is absolutely good business. That is why we thank, once again, Senator Bond for work in continuing the funding for the cleanup and revitalization of the Chesapeake Bay. The bay is important because it provides tremendous jobs in our State, from the watermen who harvest the different species, including the crabs and oysters of the bay, to other small businesses that work on the bay. 
All of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate know we were hit by the terrible situation of pfiesteria--this `X-like' organism that sits in the mud, mutates 24 times, and then wreaks havoc with our fish. What our legislation provides is important research in pfiesteria. We hope to be able to come up with solutions that will be important not only for Maryland and the causes of it, but also that will help other parts of the country, like North Carolina, and rivers that are affected by animal wastes, with dire consequences. 
We are also very pleased the Federal Emergency Management Administration has been funded. We will meet, of course, the 9-1-1 request of the United States of America, but I believe in FEMA we provided the three `R's.' We have funded readiness; we have funded response; and we have also funded both rehabilitation, but more importantly, prevention. This has been the hallmark, I think, of FEMA during the last 5 years, to do training at the local community and throughout this Nation, to be ready for those disasters that normally would affect a particular region, but at the same time the readiness help to move to a quick response. Often after a disaster we can't restore it to its old condition or even better, and, therefore, we need to look at ways to prevent disasters. 
There is also another disaster that threatens the United States that is very deeply troubling to me. That is the whole issue of threats of terrorist attacks on our own United States of America. I know at the highest level there are coordinated task forces, particularly from our military, but within our legislation we made sure we fund FEMA's effort to do the training necessary to deal with attacks, particularly of bioterrorism and chemical weapons. We regard this as a very important effort. 
I want to mention before I close the very close cooperation we have had in this bill with the authorizers on Housing and Banking. I particularly acknowledge the role of my senior Senator, Senator Paul Sarbanes, and Senator Mack of Florida. They really worked hard this year to come up with a new authorizing framework for public housing. I believe that they did it. They worked on economic integration of public housing so it doesn't remain ZIP Codes of pathology. We have worked together in our legislation. We are taking their authorization and incorporating it here to make sure that there are new housing resources. In our bill there will be 50,000 new vouchers designed for welfare-to-work, to make sure that welfare is not a way of life but a tool to a better life, and that public housing is not a way of life but a tool to a better life. We have worked cooperatively with them, and we have worked long and hard on our bill to eliminate outmoded public housing rules that only hold people in place, and often have kept people in poverty. 
Also, this legislation will extend the life of HOPE VI. HOPE VI is a program that I helped develop that not only tried to eliminate the concentrations of poverty and bring down the old walls of public housing, but to create new hope and new opportunity. I am so pleased the authorizers have spent over 2 years looking at this to come up with a new framework. 
I know my own colleague, Senator Sarbanes, is trying to get here to speak on this bill. If he doesn't, I know he will speak later. We were both due at a breakfast meeting in Baltimore and he covered that so I could be here to move my bill. How I like working as a team. It is really a great pleasure to me to have my senior colleague, Paul Sarbanes, on the Budget Committee, as well as on the Housing and Banking where we have worked as a team to look at the day-to-day needs of people. 
He took this concept of what was happening in public housing and delved into it to come up with new ideas and a new framework. He had the support of Senator Mack, who I know has gone into public housing, talked with residents, listened to the best ideas of foundations and think tanks and also the needs of residents, as did my own senior colleague. I wish all of my colleagues could enjoy the relationship with their colleague within my State as I do. Senator Sarbanes and Senator Mack have come up with a new framework. They pushed us to the wall to come up with new funding. We had to forage for the funds, but we were able to do it. We truly hope this will create hope and opportunity. 
In addition to that, we are particularly appreciative of the conference report to maintain the funding for national service, which others had wanted to eliminate. 
We want to thank them for that because that is also another tool for creating hope and opportunity. So that is my perspective on the VA-HUD bill. Once again, working on a bipartisan basis, we show that we can meet the day-to-day needs of our American people, as well as the long-range needs of the United States of America. I thank Senator Bond and his staff for, once again, the cooperative and bipartisan way that they have worked with my staff and myself. Senator Bond, I thank you for all of the courtesies, the collegiality, and the consultation in which we engaged on this bill. I thank you for really the professionalism of your staff, Jon Kamarck and Carrie Apostolou, who really helped me in many ways to come up with good ideas and worked with you for good solutions. 
I also thank my own staff, Andy Givens and David Bowers, and Bertha Lopez, a detailee from HUD who has been with us, who has worked hard to make sure I could fill my responsibilities. I thank them for their hard work and effort. 
In closing, I also want to say that over on the House side, another member of VA-HUD is retiring. We pay our respects to Congressman Louis Stokes, who has also really helped move this bill forward. 
So, Mr. President, that is my perspective on the bill. In a few minutes, I know we will be moving toward a vote. I urge every single Senator on my side of the aisle to support this bipartisan effort to move the appropriations and really encourage all others with outstanding appropriations to act in the same bipartisan fashion that we have. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I will vote against the motion to proceed on H.R. 10, the Financial Services Act of 1998. I oppose this legislation because it is inappropriate to bring down the protective firewalls in U.S. financial services while a firestorm is sweeping global financial institutions. Mr. President, this is the wrong time to be relaxing our protective financial services regulations. 
I understand the intellectual argument to reform our financial services. In fact, I do not dispute it. There is no doubt that the U.S. needs to be competitive in the global marketplace. I would suggest to my colleagues, though, that changes in the global economic picture make this bill unwise. The global economic situation is vastly different now than when this bill was being drafted. 
There are a number of what I call `yellow flashing lights' or warning signals that now is not the right time to enact this legislation. Let me mention a few. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger recently stated in the Washington Post that no government and virtually no economist predicted this global economic crisis, understood its extent or anticipated its staying power. 
Now the United States Senate is going to rearrange the national financial landscape? We need to modernize the United States to go global? I think we need to pause and ask what does going global mean and do we want to go there at this time? In this current global environment of national financial collapses, IMF bailouts and hedge funds rescue packages have become daily occurrences. These are the `yellow flashing lights' and I believe we must proceed with caution to avoid rash and irrevocable changes when the savings of hard working families and the viability of our communities could be put in serious jeopardy. 
Frankly, I am also concerned that the bill before us is the result of last-minute deal making. The issues here are too important for hasty decision-making. The decisions this bill makes affect the financial security of average Americans who are working and saving to provide for their families, U.S. financial institutions, the American economy and the global financial marketplace. 
These are not trivial issues. We are being asked to establish a legislative framework for the financial services industry for decades to come. These are irrevocable decisions. 
As changes were made to accommodate this interest or that interest, I am concerned that we have lost sight of the overall impact of the bill before us. I am concerned that we do not know enough about what's in the bill at this juncture, and what it will mean for our economic security. In the haste to get the job done before the Congress adjourns for the year, I have serious and deep reservations that changes have been made that have not been well thought out or thought through. If enacted, we will end up with unintended, but nevertheless, negative consequences because we rushed to the finish line. 
Advocates of this legislation always mention the free market. They believe that buyers and sellers acting in their own self-interests will produce winners and losers, and bring about the best and most efficient outcome for banking customers. But look at what the free market has brought us lately-- a global financial meltdown and hedge funds that are `too big to fail'. As Kissinger suggested, indiscriminate globalism has generated a world-wide assault on the concept of free financial markets. In the United States, where we used to boast about our well functioning capital markets, we now bail out those investors who make foolish decisions. 
One need look no further than the Long-Term Capital debacle to see evidence that even the brightest minds on Wall Street, acting in the free market, sometimes make very poor decisions. The collapse of this high-flying hedge fund was a failure of proper supervision. As Kenneth Guenther explains in the Baltimore Sun, this raises serious questions about our regulatory structure: `it doesn't make sense to have too-big-to-fail institutions if the regulatory structure is not up to regulating them. . . . if the regulators have to make a choice between the safety of the financial system and the free market, the financial system will win. There is no free market and there never will be. It's the height of hypocrisy to talk about the free market in one breath and bail out Long-Term Capital . . . in the next breath.' Mr. President, I oppose this legislation because in this environment, we need more oversight and enforcement in our financial services, not less. 
Beyond these concerns that this is not the right time to enact these sweeping changes buttressed by the follies of the free market, I have other, structural concerns with the proposed changes to our financial services laws. 
First, I am concerned that if we relax the laws about who can own and operate financial institutions, an unhealthy concentration of financial resources will be the inevitable result. The savings of the many will be controlled by the few. If we relax banking regulations in this country, Americans will know less about where their deposits are kept and about how they are being used. 
Marylanders used to have savings accounts with local banks where the teller knew their name and their family. We have already seen the trend toward mega-mergers, accompanied by higher fees, a decline in service, and the loss of neighborhood financial institutions. This bill accelerates that trend. 
With a globalization of financial resources, the local bank could be bought by a holding company based in Thailand. Instead of the friendly teller, consumers will be contacting a computer operator in a country half-way around the globe through an 800 number. Their account will be subject to financial risks that have nothing to do with their job, their community, or even the economy of the United States. I know impersonalized globalization is not what banking customers want when we talk about modernization of the financial services. 
Second, I am concerned that complex financial and insurance products will now be sold in a cluttered market by untrained individuals. Investment and insurance planning for families is a very important process, one of the most important decisions a family makes. It should be done with a professional who is certified and who is someone you can trust. By breaking down these firewalls and allowing various companies to offer insurance and complex investment products, we run the risk that consumers will be confused, defrauded, and treated like market segments and not individuals with unique needs and goals. 
Finally, I believe that any modernization of our financial services law should not just retain, but expand the important consumer protections and community investment policies currently in place. 
Consumers need protections and regulations to guarantee the safety of their deposits and the availability of basic banking services and credit to help their communities grow. If we have a Consumer Product Safety Commission to protect children from flammable sleepware, I believe we should also have a strong regulatory framework to protect consumers, not just investors, in the financial services marketplace. 
A strong regulatory framework will not be provided by the Federal Reserve, as is proposed in this legislation. I share the concerns of John Hawke, Undersecretary of the Treasury Department, that shifting the regulatory power from the Office of the Controller of the Currency to the Federal Reserve Board is a highly questionable regulatory protection. This would be like letting the bankers regulate themselves. The decision making of the Federal Reserve is directly linked to the banking industry that it would regulate. Bankers elect two thirds of the Federal Reserves directors. It is true that the Federal Reserve is independent of the administration, but it is not independent of the bankers and finance companies that it would regulate. 
Mr. President, I am not opposed to a necessary reform of our financial services laws. But this is not the legislation and this is not the time to do it. The U.S. stock market has had one of the worst quarters since 1990 and world leaders are currently strategizing about how to stanch the global economic crisis. 
The Congress will be back in 90 days. Hopefully, the world market will be calmer, it will be after the election, and we will be able to study the lessons learned from the financial events of the past three months. For all the hard work and all the negotiating and compromise, now is not the time to go forward and add more fuel to what is already a very troubling global financial firestorm.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report. I oppose this bill for three reasons. First and foremost, it does not meet the needs of my state of Maryland. Second, it does not sufficiently fund agriculture programs in order to help all American farmers. Third, the method by which the funding is spent is wholly inadequate to address the farm crisis. 
In my state of Maryland, we have been plagued by drought for the second consecutive year. Our farmers are losing crops and they are losing money. They are struggling just to survive. Couple the drought with the record low prices, high costs and a glut in the market and that spells disaster for our farmers. Official data reports that drought has destroyed between 30 percent and 65 percent of the crops in nine Southern Maryland and lower Eastern Shore counties. Loss of soybean, tobacco, wheat and corn crops is making this a very tough season for Maryland farmers. Let me assure you I will not just stand by and let this happen to my farmers. 
I am already fighting with the rest of the Maryland delegation team to provide emergency loans from the Department of Agriculture to our farmers and to officially designate them disaster areas because of the drought. But this money does not really take care of the problem. This is not some heroic assistance program for our farmers. It is just a loan. This is money that must be paid back. It does not provide any real long term assistance for our farming community. That is precisely the job of Congress today. 
Our farmers need help so they can continue to farm. They need help now, this is true, and they need these loans. But eventually, loans must be paid back with money earned. And this money will not and cannot be earned without our help. We should be uplifting our farmers and helping them to help themselves. Not just continuing their burden of debt. We need help, and this Agriculture Appropriations bill neither addresses Maryland's agricultural problems nor the agricultural problems scourging the rest of our country. 
Farmers in my state of Maryland came to me with their priorities for this bill, neither of which are adequately addressed. First, this bill does not provide adequate funding for operating loans so farmers can buy the equipment and supplies necessary to plan for the next season. Without these loans, many of our farmers will not have the funds they need to plant. This then becomes a vicious cycle. Without the funds to plant, the farmers cannot make money for the next year, and pay back or even be eligible for loan assistance. 
The second, and most important reason this bill does not satisfy the needs of my state is because this bill does not uncap the market loans. My farmers have told me that their number one priority is to take the artificial caps off the market loans. In fact, my farmers have told me they desperately needed the caps off the market loans. Last week, a new U.S. Department of Agriculture report forecasted a net farm income for 1998 at $42 billion, down $7.9 billion from last year. This amounts to nearly a 16 percent drop in farm income. The report also said that farm debt is anticipated to reach $172 billion by the end of 1998. 
What do these forecasts tell us? This says that any federal response that stops short of recognizing the fundamental problem of depressed prices will absolutely not address the problem. We cannot pass a band-aid measure and expect it to stick in the long term. This is just not possible. The only way to start to correct the problem is to start at the root. And this means acknowledging and dealing with the depressed crop prices. Uncapping the market loans is crucial to confronting this problem. 
I will not vote for this bill today because it does not provide enough funding to deal with these problems. The Democratic farm relief package offered by Senator Harkin in conference was sadly defeated along partisan lines. This package would have provided the necessary $7.3 billion in funds to cover both disaster and economic losses, including a provision to increase marketing loan rates. The Republican plan--less than $4 billion--adopted by the committee came as an extreme disappointment. All states suffer under the Republican plan. In my state alone, Maryland would receive only $7 million in assistance verses $21 million under the Democratic plan. 
The magnitude of losses suffered simply does not merit this meager and shallow attempt to pass this bill. All one need do is look at the facts. The level of economic assistance contained in the bill is $1.65 billion. The net farm income projected is expected to fall this year alone by $8 billion to $10 billion. Clearly, this bill does not increase the amount of relief to a level that will help farmers weather the economic crisis. 
Finally, I will not support this bill because the method by which the funding is spent is wholly inadequate to address the farm crisis. The assistance is not directed to the person who suffered the loss. Increasing the Republican plan would simply send money to landlords who have already been paid their cash rent for the year. These Agricultural Market Transition Act (AMTA) payments benefit the absentee landowner, rather than the farmers who need the assistance. One recent study showed that 73 percent of the nation's farmers feel the current farm bill does not provide adequate income during low-price periods. This means the current system is failing us. Rather than pump more money into a failed system, it is time we overhaul the method. 
Let me say that I absolutely agree with Senators Daschle and Harkin that this bill does not sufficiently address the farm crisis. More needs to be done. I am sorry not to vote for this appropriations bill. Mr. President, let me be clear--I wanted to vote for an agriculture appropriations bill today. I think we all did. In fact, I want to see all thirteen of these appropriations bills pass, as they rightly should. But I will not support a bill that short-changes our farmers. I did not vote for the Freedom to Farm bill for this very reason, I will not vote for the agriculture appropriations bill today.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the Senate passage of the Mammography Quality Standards Reauthorization Act (MQSA). It is timely and appropriate that the Senate took action on this important legislation in time for Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October and on the eve of the march against cancer right here in Washington. The bill that the Senate passed reauthorizes the original legislation which passed in 1992 with bipartisan support. 
What MQSA does is require that all facilities that provide mammograms meet key safety and quality-assurance standards in the area of personnel, equipment, and operating procedures. Before the law passed, tests were misread, women were misdiagnosed, and people died as a result of sloppy work. Since 1992, MQSA has been successful in raising the quality of mammography services that women receive. 
What are these national, uniform quality standards for mammography? Well, facilities are required to use equipment designed specifically for mammography. Only radiological technologists can perform mammography. Only qualified doctors can interpret the results of mammography. Facilities must establish a quality assurance and control program to ensure reliability, clarity and accurate interpretation of mammograms. Facilities must be inspected annually by qualified inspectors. Finally, facilities must be accredited by an accrediting body approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
This current reauthorization makes some improvements to the current law. It ensures that women will receive direct written notification of their mammogram results. MQSA already requires written notification of mammography results to self-referred women. Now this provision will apply to all women. Women won't assume that `no news is good news' when this isn't always the case. They will know what their results are, so that they can get any follow up care they need. The Agency for Health Care Policy Research has cited studies that show that direct communication with patients, which is in addition to written communication to health care providers, dramatically increases compliance with follow up recommendations. Women are entitled to know the results of their exams. This new provision will ensure that women are informed and active participants in their health care decisions. 
This legislation also allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a demonstration program for less than annual inspections for facilities that have excellent track records. This program will not be implemented before April 1, 2001, which is almost two years after the final regulations implementing MQSA go into effect. The facilities that participate in this program will continue to be inspected to ensure that they continue to comply with MQSA standards. A strong inspection program under MQSA is extremely important to assure the public that quality standards are being met. In a 1997 GAO report which evaluated the MQSA inspection program, GAO praised the program. I am very interested in the results of this demonstration. This demonstration program will provide us with an important opportunity to see if less than annual inspections are just as effective in making high-quality facilities comply with MQSA. It should allow the FDA to focus more of its attention on ensuring compliance with MQSA standards by facilities where problems have been identified in the past. The best way to protect the public health is for the FDA to focus its resources on the problem facilities. 
This bill also contains a few minor changes to the law to ensure that: patients and referring physicians be advised of any mammography facility deficiency; women are guaranteed the right to obtain an original of their mammogram; physicians who review facility images on behalf of accreditation bodies are highly qualified and subject to high ethical standards; and both state and local government agencies are permitted to have inspection authority. 
I like MQSA because it has saved lives. The front line against breast cancer is mammography. We know that early detection saves lives. But a mammogram is worse than useless if it produces a poor-quality image or is misinterpreted. The first rule of all medical treatment is: Above all things, do no harm. And a bad mammogram can do real harm by leading a woman and her doctor to believe that nothing is wrong when something is. The result can be unnecessary suffering or even a death that could have been prevented. That is why this legislation is so important. And that is why I am so pleased that this law is being reauthorized, so that we don't go back to the old days when women's lives were in jeopardy. 
I want to make sure that women's health needs are met comprehensively. It is expected that 178,700 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed and about 43,900 women will die from the disease in 1998. This makes breast cancer the most common cancer among women. And only lung cancer causes more deaths in women. 
We must aggressively pursue prevention in our war on breast cancer. I pledge to fight for new attitudes and to find new ways to end the needless pain and death that too many American women face. This bill is an important step in that direction. 
As the 105th Congress comes to a close, we can look back on some great bipartisan victories and other great bipartisan frustrations. But one area Republicans and Democrats have always worked together on is women's health. I am proud of this bill's broad bipartisan support. I want to take this opportunity to thank all 56 cosponsors of my MQSA bill here in the Senate for their support. I also want to recognize Congresswoman Nancy Johnson and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton as the original sponsors of the House MQSA bill. I applaud the Democrats and Republicans of the House Commerce Committee, especially Congressmen Bliley, Dingell, Bilirakis, and Brown for their leadership on MQSA. A special thanks also goes to Senator Jeffords for working with me to make reauthorization of MQSA a reality. As Dean of the Democratic Women, I want to also thank the Dean of the Republican Women, Kay Bailey Hutchinson, for always reaching out to work together on the issues that matter most to American women and their families. MQSA is a shining example of what the U.S. Congress can accomplish when both Republicans and Democrats work together for the good of the American people.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for raising the minimum wage. In 1996, Congress helped millions of working Americans by increasing the minimum wage by 90 cents over two years. Passing that historic measure was a good first step. Now, it is time for us to take another one. 
I am proud to be cosponsoring the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998, a bill that will help even more Americans take that next step. This much-needed legislation would raise the hourly minimum wage to $6.15 over the next two years. The first part of this bill would take effect on January 1, 1999, and would raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $5.65 per hour. Then, on January 1, 2000, the minimum wage would be raised to $6.15 per hour. 
I support this minimum wage increase for many of the same reasons I supported the last one. In 1995, I said that an increase in the minimum wage would help working Americans improve their standard of living. I said that it would help them move one step closer to self-sufficiency. And I said that it would give them the opportunity to practice self-help. 
It has done all these things, and it has helped business and trade at the same time. The results in my state alone tell the story. Since we increased the minimum wage in 1996, employment in Maryland is up and unemployment is down. We've added 54,500 new jobs since September 1996, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.7%. I'd say that's progress. 
I believe we can expand upon the progress we've already made by increasing the minimum wage again. A minimum wage increase would give a raise to more than 129,000 Marylanders and their families. It would enable Marylanders to improve their standard of living. It would move them closer to self-sufficiency. And it would allow them to practice self-help. 
An increase in the minimum wage equals an increase in the standard of living for working Americans. This is especially important to me. Since I first came to Congress, my economic mission has always been a pretty simple one: to help those who are in the middle class stay there or do better and to give those who are not in the middle class the chance to get there. I support this bill because it gets at the heart of my mission. I know that to some people, a $1.00 increase in the minimum wage over the course of two years may not seem like much at all. But even a small increase like this one will mean a whole lot to many others. 
An increase in the minimum wage will also help many Americans move one step closer to economic self-sufficiency. We all know by now that minimum wage workers aren't just high school kids working part-time jobs after school and on the weekends. In fact, two-thirds of minimum wage earners are adults, and nearly 60% are mothers, many with young kids to support. 
We don't have to tell working moms who are struggling to make ends meet what an extra $1.00 an hour means. An extra $1.00 an hour means more groceries in the refrigerator. An extra $1.00 an hour means that the mortgage or the rent gets paid. An extra $1.00 an hour means a full tank of gas in the car. And, most importantly, an extra $1.00 an hour can mean more time to spend with their families. That single dollar goes a long way for those moms. 
Finally, an increase in the minimum wage will give people the opportunity to practice self-help. For too long now, Americans, including those working moms, have been working longer and harder only to see their paychecks get smaller and smaller. This cycle has got to stop. Those Americans who are working for minimum wage are not asking for handouts. They're asking for fair pay for hard work. 
Right now, even after the previous minimum wage increase, a mother who works full-time--that's 40 hours per week and 52 weeks a year--earns only about $10,700 a year. That is $2,600 below the poverty level for a family of three. I don't think that someone who shows up everyday and works hard should be condemned to a life in poverty. A fair day's work should mean a fair day's pay. 
Does that $10,700 salary reward a working mom's hard work? No. Does that salary give her an incentive to stay off welfare? No. Does that salary give her the time to walk her kids to school, help them with their homework, or even read to them at night? Absolutely not. In fact, that $10,700 salary barely allows her to clothe them, put a roof over their heads, or put food on the table. No mom should have to make the choice between paying the heating bill or buying her child new school shoes. Forcing working moms to make choices like that is wrong. 
That same mom who works full-time, plays by the rules, and does everything else we ask of her ought to be able to get ahead. I don't think that's asking too much. Hard-working minimum wage workers are just like everyone else--they want to climb up the American economic ladder. Too often, however, that ladder looks too tall to climb. Too often, the rungs on that ladder are too far apart from each other. Too often they are just a little bit out of reach. As representatives of those workers, we can help them climb that ladder. We can and should give them that little push they need to grasp the next rung. This bill gives them that little boost, and that is why it has my full support.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, Sunday, September 20, 1998 marked the end of an era in sports. Cal Ripken, baseball's Iron Man, took a well-deserved day off. As the Baltimore Sun put it, `The Streak died of natural causes. It was 2,632.' 
Cal Ripken sat in the dugout Sunday night not because of injury, or illness, or a manager's decision. Cal voluntarily took himself out of the lineup because he felt he was not playing up to his own standards, and would not contribute enough to the team. Cal's quietly monumental decision exemplifies the dignity and class with which he has conducted himself throughout his career. 
When Cal Ripken began his streak in 1982, Ronald Reagan was President, I was a Congresswoman, `Dallas' was the most popular TV show, and the movie `ET' was setting box office records. A baby born that year is about to be a junior in high school. Ryan Minor, who played in Cal's place Sunday night, was 8 years old. 
I was in the stands September 6, 1995, the night that Cal played game number 2,131. I've watched history being made on the Senate floor, but that night I watched history being made on the glorious green field of Camden Yards. I will never forget the joy we all felt as the banners rolled, the light bulbs flashed, and Cal took his victory lap. 
Records are made to be broken, but I can't imagine Cal's record being broken in our lifetime. The next closest player, Albert Belle, would have to play in every game for the next 14 years to equal The Streak. 
What Cal has accomplished is simple: Every day for the last 16 years, he got up, got dressed, and went to work. He represents the old-fashioned ethic displayed by millions of Marylanders every day as they work hard, play by the rules, and take care of their families. It's not fancy, it's not flashy, but it is the glue that holds our communities, our society, and our nation together. 
So to Cal Ripken, I say hats off, thank you for being you, and thank you for showing all of us how it's supposed to be done.'

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Act of 1998, introduced by Senators Reid and Grassley. I have always been a strong advocate for the senior citizens of our nation and I believe this bill will help provide a safety net for some of our sickest seniors. I was pleased to recently join my colleagues as a cosponsor of this bill for two reasons--it repeals an unnecessary $1,500 cap on Medicare outpatient rehabilitation services and will allow seniors to receive treatment services that are essential to their health. 
Every year our elderly are threatened by strokes, multiple injuries, and diseases. Seniors who suffer from strokes and multiple diseases in a given year often have complex health care needs that require costly, comprehensive treatment. One study has estimated that almost 13% of all Medicare beneficiaries or 635,000 seniors who receive rehabilitative services outside of a hospital setting will exceed the $1,500 cap. The treatment that they desperately need would exceed the $1,500 cap and require seniors to pay out of pocket for services or seek treatment in a hospital outpatient department in order for Medicare to cover their treatment. 
How could our senior citizens be treated this way? How did this come to be? Well let me tell you, in 1997 Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act. Within that Act we placed a $1,500 cap on outpatient rehabilitation services. Limits on the cap were adopted without adequate committee hearings and a detailed analysis was not conducted by HCFA to determine the likely effects on beneficiaries' ability to obtain medically necessary services. 
This was a mistake, but fortunately we can correct it by passing this legislation. The Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Act ensures senior citizens the right to receive the medical services they need to recover. Under this bill, senior citizens will no longer be hindered by financial limitations on rehabilitation services and seniors who don't live near a hospital won't be forced to travel there just to have Medicare pay for their treatment services. I don't want an 85-year-old woman who has had a stroke and is trying to regain her ability to speak or eat to have to travel to a hospital 30 minutes away to receive treatment. 
I want to let those who depend on Medicare know that we are working to protect their health. While we must continue to work diligently to protect the solvency of Medicare, we can't let seniors who need rehabilitation services fall through the cracks. I salute the sponsors of this bill and urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on whether or not to override the President's veto of H.R. 1122, the so-called `Partial Birth Abortion Ban'. I will cast my vote to uphold the President's veto. 
I do so for several reasons. First and foremost, this bill denies a woman, in consultation with her physician, the right to make necessary or appropriate medical decisions. Second, it does not provide any protection for a woman whose health is grievously threatened by her pregnancy. Third, this bill will not stop a single abortion from occurring. Finally, it is unconstitutional. 
I believe that women, in consultation with their physicians, must make decisions on what is medically necessary or appropriate in reproductive matters. These must be medical decisions not political decisions. 
Mr. President, we need to let doctors be doctors. This is my principle whether we are talking about reproductive choice or any health care matter. Physicians have the training and expertise to make medical decisions. They are in the best position to determine what is necessary or appropriate for their patients. Not bureaucrats. Not managed care accountants. And certainly not legislators. 
Who is best equipped to decide whether a difficult pregnancy threatens a woman's life? Who decides whether a woman would suffer grievous injury to her physical health if a pregnancy is continued? Who decides what is medically necessary for a particular woman in her unique circumstances? 
The answer must be that doctors decide. The women themselves must decide. Legislators should not take the decision away from them. This bill is unacceptable because it shackles physicians. It prevents them from exercising their best medical judgement on behalf of their patients. 
I also will vote to uphold the President's veto because this bill does not offer any protections for women's health. I know that there are many who view efforts to provide for the health of the woman as some sort of loophole. But I believe we must acknowledge the realities of women's health and women's lives. 
Even the most ardent opponent of reproductive rights would have to acknowledge that there are medical crises that arise during pregnancy that could cause profound harm to women's health. Yet the authors of the bill before us refused to make any concession to health concerns 
I will vote today to sustain the President's veto because this bill would not prevent one abortion--not one. By banning a particular procedure, it does nothing to stop abortions from occurring. A doctor can still opt to use any other abortion procedure--even ones that might be less suitable for the woman's particular health circumstances. So let's be clear--this bill would not prevent abortions. 
Finally, this bill fails the test of constitutionality. The Supreme Court in Roe versus Wade and in its subsequent decisions has been quite clear. Prior to the point of fetal viability, a woman's right to an abortion is constitutionally protected. 
The Court has also insisted that any legislation restricting abortion must ensure that the woman's life and her health are protected. The woman's physician must place her health as the paramount concern. On both of these points, this bill fails to meet the constitutional standard the Court has established. 
This is not mere speculation. In 19 out of 20 states that have passed `partial-birth' abortion bills, either a court or state attorney general has prevented those laws from taking effect. Six of those states used language that is identical to the bill now before the Senate. Seventeen courts have ruled that these state laws are unconstitutional. So it should be clear that this bill cannot pass constitutional muster. 
For all of these reasons this bill is seriously flawed. The President's veto of this legislation was the right thing to do. It was the constitutional thing to do. I expect that the Senate will vote today to uphold that veto. 
When the Senate passed this legislation last May, I said that its passage was a hollow victory. It was hollow because the bill could never be enacted into law and could never be upheld as Constitutional. I believe that subsequent events are proving that prediction to be correct. 
There is a better way to address this issue. I believe the vast majority of my colleagues would agree that--absent a threat to life or a grievous threat to a woman's health--abortion in the last months of pregnancy is not defensible. Why can't we enact legislation that would provide a ban on those post viability abortions? 
When the Senate considered this issue last May, I worked with my Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and a bipartisan group of Senators to craft such an approach. The Daschle alternative would have meant fewer abortions. It banned all abortions once a fetus had achieved viability. 
It provided only two exceptions--first, when the woman's life was threatened by continuing the pregnancy. Second, when she was at risk of grievous injury to her physical health. And it allowed the woman and her physician to make that medical determination. 
I still believe that is the correct approach, the common sense approach. The Daschle alternative was respectful of the Constitution. It safeguarded women's health. I was disappointed that we were unable to pass this alternative. I believe the President would have signed a bill along the lines of the Daschle alternative. 
Because I believe so strongly that this is the correct approach to take, I have joined with my colleague, Senator Durbin, and others, in introducing a bill modeled after the Daschle alternative. 
I urge my colleagues--whether you support the bill we are considering today or not and whatever your views on reproductive choice--to take another look at this proposal. 
It is our best chance to forge a consensus on this issue. We can stop inappropriate post-viability abortions while still protecting the lives and health of women. The Durbin bill shows us the way. I believe it reflects the values and views of the American people. 
So, Mr. President, I will vote to sustain the President's veto today. But I would urge my colleagues to bring fresh thinking to this matter. We can have a real legislative solution, rather than a political wedge issue. We should certainly try.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, once again the Senate is considering campaign finance reform. As my colleagues know, the House of Representatives in August passed a strong reform measure. I'm pleased that their action has prompted a renewed effort here in the Senate to pass a comprehensive campaign finance reform measure. 
I started my career in politics as a community activist, working to prevent a highway from demolishing my Fell's Point neighborhood. I don't want the next generation of community activists shut out of the process. I want them to know that their efforts matter. I want people to have an opportunity to participate in their communities and in our political process. I want to restore each American's faith and trust in government. The McCain-Feingold amendment is an important part of that effort. 
I have consistently supported campaign finance reform, so I will gladly vote to close debate on the McCain-Feingold amendment. I hope we will invoke cloture, and move quickly to a vote on final passage of this amendment. Vote after vote this year has shown that a majority of the Senate supports McCain-Feingold. 
Unfortunately, through parliamentary tactics and filibuster, a majority of the Senate has not been able to work its will on this issue. I hope we will be successful today in at last ending the filibuster on this issue. 
During my time in the United States Senate, I have voted 19 times to end filibusters on campaign finance reform. So I know we have a fight on our hands. But it is time for action, and it is time for reform. The American people are counting on us. 
I believe we need campaign finance reform for a number of reasons. First and most important, we need to restore people's faith in the integrity of government, the integrity of their elected officials, and the integrity of our political process. 
Many Americans are fed up with a political system that ignores our Nation's problems and places the concerns of working families behind those of big interests. Our campaign finance system contributes to a culture of cynicism that hurts our institutions, our government and our country. 
When Congress fails to enact legislation to save our kids from the public health menace of smoking because of the undue influence of Big Tobacco, it adds to that culture of cynicism. When powerful health care industry interests are able to block measures to provide basic patient protections for consumers who belong to HMOs, that adds to the culture of cynicism. Is it any wonder that Americans do not trust their elected leaders to act in the public interest? 
Today we have a chance to help break that culture of cynicism. We can enact legislation to eliminate the undue influence of special interests in elections. 
How does this amendment do that? First of all, it stems the flood of unregulated, unreported money in campaigns. It will ban soft money, money raised and spent outside of federal campaign rules and which violates the spirit of those rules. It will end the sham of `issue ads' that are really designed to support or oppose federal candidates. 
This amendment will improve the disclosure of contributions, and expand the Federal Election Commission's enforcement capabilities. It will codify the Beck decision, by allowing non-union members who pay fees in lieu of union dues to obtain a refund of the portion of those fees used for political activities. It will make it less likely for wealthy candidates to try to buy elections, by barring political parties from making coordinated expenditures for candidates who do not agree to limit their personal spending. 
These are all reasonable reforms. They will get the big money and the secret money out of campaigns. They will help to strengthen democracy and strengthen the people's faith in their elected officials. 
Mr. President, we can improve our political process, making it more fair and more inclusive, without compromising our rights under the Constitution. 
By limiting the influence of those with big dollars, and increasing the influence of those with big hearts, we can bring government back to where it belongs--with the people. 
The McCain-Feingold amendment will help us to do that. I am proud to support it with my voice and my vote.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Nursing Home Patient Protection Act. I wish this legislation was not necessary, but it is. It is necessary and we must pass this bill because senior citizens and people with disabilities are being cruelly forced to leave their homes. Why? Not because of some failure of their own, not because they haven't spent their lives working hard, and not because they deserve to be kicked out for any other reason. These people, mostly senior citizens, are being told to leave their homes because of inadequacies in our Medicaid program. This is not right, Mr. President. It is unfair, unacceptable, and Un-American to sit by while many of our senior citizens are shuffled around like a deck of cards. I think honoring your mother and father is not just good practice--it is good public policy. 
Most seniors begin paying their nursing home bills with their own life's savings. Later, when they run out of money, they typically enter the Medical Assistance Program. All too often, nursing homes then tell these residents, some of whom have lived in a home for 20 years or more, that they must leave because Medicaid payment rates are too low. No warning is given, and little assistance for relocation is available. They are, quite literally, left out on the street to find another facility on their own. Think of your parents in a similar situation: their health is not what it once was, they are accustomed to their current surroundings, and they were promised by their nursing home that they would be allowed to stay when they ran out of money and became Medicaid recipients. Then, without any warning, they are told that they must leave what has been their home within the next two months. How would you react? I know how I would react--with anger, fear, and disbelief. It is wrong and dangerous to disrupt seniors in such a manner. Getting adjusted to a new environment is difficult at any age, but for seniors, the added stress is often enough to significantly diminish their health, leading to additional medical problems, and even premature death. 
This bill does not attempt to force nursing homes to accept Medicaid patients. Rather, it recognizes the fact that nursing homes should have the right to take only `private pay' patients if they so choose. That is the nature of the marketplace. 
This bill does require nursing homes to be honest about their policies concerning Medicaid and ensures that patients are not misled. This bill would require nursing homes to formally notify potential residents of their policy regarding Medicaid. Furthermore, under this legislation, if a nursing home converts to private pay only status, it must still honor its previous promise to current residents and accept their Medicaid payments. 
Senior citizens' advocacy groups strongly support this legislation. As noteworthy, the nursing home industry supports the bill. Calling it `intelligent public policy,' the American Health Care Association, which represents over 11,000 nursing homes, acknowledges the fact that no one should be lied to and kicked out of their homes. Nursing home officials realize, as we do, that this bill will not damage the economic viability of running a nursing home. It will simply give seniors the security of knowing they will not be suddenly forced to leave their homes when they run out of their own savings. 
I also want to say a bit about the last section of the bill. The final section is crucial because it requires the Secretary of HHS to examine Medicaid reimbursement rates and make sure they are reasonable. This work will then be compiled and submitted to Congress within five years after the bill's passage. Hopefully, this report will shed light on the Medicaid system's problems and initiate the process of correcting them. 
This legislation will provide some much needed security for our seniors. I hope it will also start the process of improving our Medicaid system. People on Medicaid are regularly denied services by nursing homes and hospitals because the reimbursement rates are unreasonably low. The Secretary's report, required by this bill, is a step in the right direction. 
In closing, I would like to thank Senator Graham for introducing this important legislation. I know that he sincerely shares my concern for the well-being of older Americans, as do all of the bill's cosponsors. We have a responsibility to make sure that Americans are treated fairly and humanely. This bill does just that. Let's take care of our parents, our grandparents, and ourselves by passing this important legislation.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, and to all who are with us in the proceedings today, I rise with melancholy to pay tribute to four Marylanders who were killed in the tragic crash of Swissair Flight 111 late Wednesday night, September 2, 1998. Dr. Jonathan Mann and Dr. Mary Lou Clements-Mann lived in Columbia. Mark Chapman and Cauley lived in Olney. 
Mark Chapman was an engineer, and his wife was a flight attendant for American Airlines. They were on their way to Greece to visit his parents. Friends in their 10-house neighborhood in Olney tell stories about their kindness and thoughtfulness, how the Chapmans kept everyone entertained and had the whole neighborhood over for backyard barbeques. 
Mark and Cauley loved animals, and every morning Mrs. Chapman would be out with her beagle Ruby trotting along on her daily walk. In a world that too often lacks a sense of community, the Chapmans went out of their way to be a part of their community and to make others feel welcome in it. According to one neighbor, `Knowing Cauley, she was probably helping out the other stewardesses on the plane.' 
Dr. Jonathan Mann created the World Health Organization's AIDS program, and Dr. Mary Louise Clements-Mann was the director of the vaccine research at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. They were partners in science and partners in life, having met at a scientific conference three years ago and married last year. 
Their loss is felt deeply by the medical research community, and it is felt deeply by the community of caring they helped to create. More than being dedicated to research, they were dedicated to the people they were trying to help. They believed, as I do, that our policies should reflect our values. 
Dr. Mann was among the first to declare that AIDS was a disease that rightfully concerned all of us, that it did not recognize class, gender, or global boundaries. In 1984, he became director of an AIDS project in the central African nation of Zaire (now the Congo). It was there that he traced the transmission patterns and risk factors for AIDS. Unusual for a medical researcher, he also traced the political and social implications of this deadly disease. He spoke out about the connection between AIDS and human rights, and he worked with governments to fight cruelty and discrimination against people with AIDS. In February 1987, he was appointed head of the WHO AIDS office, and he and his staff visited 77 nations in nine months to assess the epidemic. 
Early this year, Dr. Mann took on a new responsibility as dean of the School of Public Health at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences. He has been described as `a dapper man who wore starched white shirts and red bow ties', who boarded the train every day to Philadelphia. Since January, he had also been a visiting professor at the Hopkins School of Public Health. 
Dr. Clements-Mann had an equally stellar list of accomplishments and a reputation as a gentle woman who could also be a tough taskmaster when it came to life-saving medical research. Born in Longview, Texas, she graduated from Texas Tech with a degree in chemistry at a time when few women were encouraged to consider science careers. She earned another degree in chemistry from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, and advanced degrees from the University of London and from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. 
In 1986, she moved to Johns Hopkins to start and direct its vaccine center. She became one of the world's experts in developing vaccines against life-threatening diseases, from Hepatitis C to influenza. Her reputation was built on selecting vaccines for medical trials that had the best chance of success, and one of the vaccines she helped develop was just approved by the FDA last week. Even as an internationally famous researcher, colleagues said she preferred to be called Mary Lou by co-workers and volunteers alike. 
Dr. Clements-Mann loved to garden and they both loved to travel and go camping. Neighbors in their Hickory Ridge neighborhood in Columbia often saw the two of them taking walks and holding hands. It is a tragedy that the world has been deprived of their knowledge, their compassion, and their ability to affect public policy in the face of worldwide epidemics.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in 1989, Sister Dianna Ortiz was brutally abducted and raped in Guatemala where she was working as a missionary. 
She was victimized by the Guatemalan government and by her own government. From the day of the attack, the United States government has compounded her suffering. She was accused of fabricating her story. She has been treated like a criminal instead of as a victim. 
I am horrified by the reports of Sister Dianna's abduction and torture--and by our government's cruel response to her suffering, which continues today. 
I would like to read to my colleagues from a column written by Paul Ferris in the National Catholic Reporter: 
Her kidnaping and confinement included multiple gang rapes; repeated beatings; intimidation and interrogation; over 100 cigarette burns on her back; video taping her captivity as a form of blackmail; and lowering her in a pit where injured women, children and men writhed and moaned and the dead decayed under swarms of rats. Finally, her abductors held her hand and arms as she was physically coerced into stabbing a woman with a machete. 
That is why I am a cosponsor of Senator Dodd's amendment to declassify government documents that shed light on human rights abuses. Federal agencies would be required to identify, organize and declassify all records regarding American activities in Guatemala and Honduras after 1944. This would enable Sister Dianna and other victims of torture to learn the truth about their cases. 
We need to learn the truth, even if it is painful. By hiding behind a wall of secrecy, we are eroding the American people's confidence and trust in their government. We undermine our foreign policy and intelligence agencies--and the important work they do--if we cover-up their past actions. 
Some argue that the release of this information would `compromise intelligence sources and methods.' I disagree. If our sources were people who attacked American citizens, we need to know it. If our methods included complicity in torture, we need to know that too. 
Sister Dianna Ortiz and other victims of torture are seeking to rebuild their lives. The least that we can do is to help them to learn the truth about the tragic events that have changed their lives. 
Mr. President: Our policies must reflect our values. If our efforts to promote democracy and human rights around the world are to be successful, we must be honest and open about the tragic mistakes we have made in the past. 
I commend Senator Dodd for his leadership in calling for an honest and just accounting of America's history in Central America. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his amendment.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to a special lady who passed away Wednesday July 30, 1998 in Baltimore, Maryland. Virginia S. Baker was special to me, my family and the entire city of Baltimore. 
Virginia Baker started as a volunteer playground monitor in Baltimore, where she brought joy and fun to the city's streets and neighborhoods. But more importantly, she always kept an eagle eye out for the children with a broken heart or the ones from a broken home. Without notice she would find a way to bring those children into her circle of compassion, to let them know they always had a home at her recreation center. She had the special gift of mending children's hearts. 
She came to serve in the recreation departments of nine Baltimore Mayors and always made sure children had a safe place to play. When I was a City Councilwoman I became friendly with Virginia because she was always hustling the City Council for more money. She took me to the playgrounds and community events, got me to play hopscotch, and got me leapfrogging over the bureaucracy to ensure strong community programs for the city of Baltimore. Virginia was also friends with my dear mother. My mother volunteered for me for several years when I served on the Baltimore City Council. When my schedule wouldn't allow me to tour the city streets, Virginia would take Pearl, her assistant, and my mother out to visit the senior centers and community playgrounds. They would never forget to stop at Faidley's for a crabcake, Greektown for a few stuffed grape leaves, or countless other diners and snack shops where Baltimoreans gathered.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman and ranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy. 
The Department of Defense appropriations bill provides funds for a Navy ship disposal pilot program. I would like to clarify the Senate's intent in creating this pilot program. 
I support the Navy's goal of disposing of these ships efficiently. However, by considering only short-term costs, the Navy has ignored the long term costs of worker death and injury and environmental degradation. 
For example, during the scrapping of the Coral Sea in Baltimore, there were many worker injuries and fires. We don't yet know the environmental damage caused by the improper disposal of asbestos. The ship is still in the Baltimore harbor, and it will now cost millions of dollars for the Navy to dispose of the ship properly. American taxpayers would have saved a lot if we had disposed of the ship correctly the first time. 
To prevent these problems, does the distinguished ranking member agree that it is the Senate's intent to encourage the Secretary of the Navy to give significant weight to the technical qualifications and past performance of the contractor in complying with federal, state and local laws and regulations for environmental and worker protection? 
In addition, do you agree that in making a best value determination in granting contracts, the Secretary should give a greater weight to technical and performance-related factors than to cost and price-related factors?

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Department of Defense's research in prostate cancer. I know that this program has no greater champion than the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens. 
Throughout my time in Congress, I have fought for women's health initiatives. Women's health is one of my highest priorities and it always will be. However, I also strongly support efforts to improve the health of men. One such effort that I believe deserves our attention is prostate cancer research. 
In my home state of Maryland alone, 3,500 men receive the ominous diagnosis of prostate cancer each year. Nationwide, the number soars to over 200,000. Even more frightening, 42,000 American men lose their lives to this ruthless killer annually. This means that every 15 minutes, 1 man somewhere in our country dies from prostate cancer, and during the same time span, 5 more men are newly diagnosed with the disease. 
I am very pleased that the frequency of prostate cancer screening has increased over the past five years. These efforts have led to an overall decrease in the prostate cancer death rate. The importance of early detection through regular screening cannot be overstated. When prostate cancer is detected early, survival rates are over 90%. But, when detected late, prostate cancer kills 70% of its victims. The increased emphasis on the use of current screening techniques has certainly been a step in the right direction. However, we can, and must, do better for the men of our country. How? Through improvement of diagnostic screening and imaging technology, we can make detection of prostate cancer easier and more efficient. We've done it before--mammograms have made screening for breast cancer a much more reliable process. We must do the same for prostate cancer. 
Last year, Congress provided $40 million to the Department of Defense for prostate cancer research. Overall, $130 million in government-funded prostate cancer research was performed, compared with $650 million for breast cancer. Of course, we all recognize the importance of fighting breast cancer. It is a major threat to the women of our nation and the fight to find new and better prevention methods must continue. I think it is time we started fighting prostate cancer with the same tenacity. 
In this year's Defense Appropriations bill we have provided $40 million for prostate cancer research. In addition to funds for peer review prostate cancer research, we have provided funding to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center for research on prostate cancer diagnostic imaging. This research is extremely important, as it could pave the way to better, faster, and more reliable screening and diagnosis. 
One in every ten American men will develop prostate cancer at some point during his life. We need to target sufficient resources for research into the causes, treatment and cure of prostate cancer. 
I hope that when the Defense Appropriations bill is in Conference, we will increase funding for prostate cancer research. Increased funding is necessary to give our scientists and researchers the tools they need to combat this deadly disease. 
We are blessed with great medical scientists who are scattered across our country at universities, medical schools, and government research agencies. They are an incredible resource. I believe that we owe it to ourselves, to our children, and to the American people to ensure that these great men and women have the support they need to continue their efforts to bring the people of our nation a better, healthier tomorrow.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by Senator DeWine. 
The bill reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee would enable federal employees, whose health insurance is provided under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, to receive coverage for abortion services. 
The DeWine amendment would prohibit coverage for abortion, except in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest. It would continue a ban which has prevented federal employees from receiving a health care service which is widely available for private sector employees. 
I oppose this amendment for two reasons. First of all, it is an assault on the earned benefits of federal employees. Secondly, it is part of a continuing assault on women's reproductive rights and would endanger women's health. 
We have seen vote after vote designed to roll back the clock on women's reproductive rights. Since 1995, there have been over 81 votes in the House and Senate on abortion-related issues. It's clear that this unprecedented assault on a woman's right to decide for herself whether or not to have a child is continuing, as this amendment demonstrates. 
Well, I support the right to choose. And I support federal employees. And that is why I strenuously oppose this amendment. 
Let me speak first about our federal employees. Some 280,000 federal employees live in the State of Maryland. I am proud to represent them. They are the people who make sure that the Social Security checks go out on time. They make sure that our nation's veterans receive their disability checks. At NIH, they are doing vital research on finding cures and better treatments for diseases like cancer, Parkinson's and Alzheimers. There is no American whose life is not touched in some way by the hard work of a federal employee. They deserve our thanks and our support. 
Instead, federal employees have suffered one assault after another in recent years. They have faced tremendous employment insecurity, as government has downsized, and eliminated over 200,000 federal jobs. Their COLA's and their retirement benefits have been threatened. They have faced the indignity and economic hardship of three government shutdowns. Federal employees have been vilified as what is wrong with government, when they should be thanked and valued for the tremendous service they provide to our country and to all Americans. 
I view this amendment as yet another assault on these faithful public servants. It goes directly after the earned benefits of federal employees. Health insurance is part of the compensation package to which all federal employees are entitled. The costs of insurance coverage are shared by the federal government and the employee. 
I know that proponents of continuing the ban on abortion coverage for federal employees say that they are only trying to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion. But that is not what this debate is about. 
If we were to extend the logic of the argument of those who favor the ban, we would prohibit federal employees from obtaining abortions using their own paychecks. After all, those funds also come from the taxpayers. 
But no one is seriously suggesting that federal employees ought not to have the right to do whatever they want with their own paychecks. And we should not be placing unfair restrictions on the type of health insurance federal employees can purchase under the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan. 
About 1.2 million women of reproductive age depend on the FEHBP for their medical care. We know that access to reproductive health services is essential to women's health. We know that restrictions that make it more difficult for women to obtain early abortions increase the likelihood that women will put their health at risk by being forced to continue a high-risk pregnancy. 
If we continue the ban on abortion services, and provide exemptions only in cases of life endangerment, rape or incest, the 1.2 million women of reproductive health age who depend on the FEHBP will not have access to abortion even when their health is seriously threatened. We will be replacing the informed judgement of medical care givers with that of politicians. 
Decisions on abortion should be made by the woman in close consultation with her physician. These decisions should be made on the basis of medical judgement, not on the basis of political judgements. Only a woman and her physician can weigh her unique circumstances and make the decision that is right for that particular woman's life and health. 
It is wrong for the Congress to try to issue a blanket prohibition on insuring a legal medical procedure with no allowance for the particular set of circumstances that an individual woman may face. I deeply believe that women's health will suffer if we do so. 
I believe it is time to quit attacking federal employees and their benefits. I believe we need to quit treating federal employees as second class citizens. I believe federal employees should be able to receive the same quality and range of health care services as their private sector counterparts. 
Because I believe in the right to choose and because I support federal employees, I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating the DeWine amendment.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I want to thank Senators Snowe and Reid, for offering this important amendment today. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Snowe amendment. I am also proud to be an original cosponsor of the Snowe-Reid bill on which this amendment is based. 
This amendment is about two things--it's about equity and it's about women's health. 
The Snowe amendment would help to narrow the gender gap for women in insurance plans. What it does it really is quite simple. It requires that any health plan for federal employees that covers prescription drugs must also cover prescription contraceptives. 
Federal Employee Health Benefit plans routinely cover prescription drugs. But they routinely discriminate against women by not including prescription contraceptives. In fact, 81% of the plans under FEHBP fail to cover all five of the leading types of contraceptives. Ten percent offer no coverage at all. 
Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of our federal employees. I am proud that so many of them call Maryland their home. They work hard in the service of our country. And I work hard for them. Whether it's fighting for fair COLAs, against disruptive and harmful shutdowns of the federal government, or fighting to prevent unwise schemes to privatize important services our federal workforce provide, they can count on me. 
Today, I am fighting for equity in health insurance coverage for federal employee women. The failure of the majority of federal health plans to cover all forms of prescription contraceptions results in unfair physical and financial burdens for women. It forces women of reproductive age to spend 68% more for out-of-pocket health care costs than men. 
This amendment would help to correct that inequity. That is one reason why I so strongly support it. 
I also support the Snowe amendment because it will help to safeguard women's health. As a member of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I have worked hard for women's health. Whether it was establishing the Office of Women's Health Research at NIH, fighting for inclusion of women in clinical trials, or ensuring that women receive safe and accurate mammograms through the Mammography Quality Standards Act, I have fought to make sure that women's health needs are met. 
Contraception is a part of basic health care for women. This amendment will ensure that federally-employed women will have the tools they need to plan their families, to avoid unintended pregnancies and to reduce the need for abortion. 
Access to family planning is one of the most important issues facing women today. Family planning improves maternal and child health. We know that unwanted pregnancies are associated with lower birth weight babies and jeopardize maternal health. They also too often put a young woman's future academic and personal achievement in jeopardy. When the resources are available to help women make good, responsible choices about parenthood and their futures, we have no excuse for not making those tools available. 
I am proud that my own state of Maryland has been a leader in this area. Earlier this year, Maryland became the first state in the nation to require insurers that cover prescription drugs to also cover FDA-approved prescription contraceptives. Maryland has once again shown itself to be on the leading edge of progressive health care policy. 
Today, the Senate has an opportunity to take the first steps in following Maryland's example. We can adopt the Snowe amendment. We can ensure that women in the federal workforce have equitable access to prescription contraceptions. 
I hope we will adopt this amendment today. And I hope we will bring to the floor soon the Snowe-Reid bill to ensure that all insurance plans that cover prescription drugs include contraceptive drugs and devices in that coverage.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998. This legislation will clearly define who is eligible to join a credit union. It will also provide important safeguards and reforms to keep our credit unions strong and to protect our constituents who use credit unions. 
One of my priorities for Maryland is to maintain Maryland's robust economy. Credit unions offer an important alternative to consumers in the financial services market. Keeping financial services competitive and keeping fees down will help to keep Maryland's economy strong. 
I am pleased that the Senate is finally taking up this legislation almost four months after it was passed overwhelmingly by the House. I am pleased because I know how important credit unions are for Maryland and the Nation. In fact, I helped to start a credit union at a church in Baltimore. 
Credit unions are important because they provide good value and good service in a community setting. A setting where the person behind the counter knows your name not just your account number. In the current era of mega-mergers in the financial services industry, credit unions are needed more than ever. 
Credit unions are a part of our communities. I have heard from many of my constituents in Maryland about this legislation. They have written letters, sent e-mail, and visited my office, all to express their support for their credit unions. I have heard from Marylanders who are members of credit unions from the Allegany County Teachers Credit Union in LaVale to the Douglas Memorial Credit Union in Baltimore to the Choptank Electric Cooperative Credit Union in Denton. They love their credit unions because they know their credit unions deliver. 
I have also heard from members of the Maryland banking community about their concerns with this legislation. Although I can appreciate their reservations, I believe many of their concerns are addressed in this compromise legislation. However, on one significant point I disagree with them. Credit unions should not pay taxes because credit unions are non-profits. The credit union slogan is `not for profit, not for charity, but for service.' I applaud that slogan and I stand with the credit unions today. 
There are several provisions in this legislation that I feel deserve to be noted. Not only will this legislation allow small groups that share a common bond to join credit unions, but this legislation will improve credit unions by strengthening regulations to ensure safety and soundness of credit unions and to strengthen the credit union deposit insurance fund. 
I also want to praise the `common sense' reforms that are included in this legislation, such as the use of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in credit union reports filed with the National Credit Union Administration, Independent Audits of Credit Unions with more than $500 million in assets, and restrictions on the compensation packages of senior managers in credit unions that convert to for-profit banks. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to send my thanks to the 1.6 million credit union members in Maryland. I am proud of them and the work they do every day. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to support their local credit unions.

Ms. MIKULSKI. I also want to voice my sorrow and the sorrow of the people of Maryland following the tragic events on Friday, July 24. 
And I rise in tribute to the heroic acts of Officer Jacob `J.J.' Chestnut, from Ft. Washington in my home state of Maryland, and special agent John Gibson, of nearby Woodbridge, Virginia, who gave their lives to protect the U.S. Capitol and its residents, to protect this building that is the symbol of freedom and democracy the world over. 
No words can adequately express my pain and outrage at the senseless killings that took place at 3:40 on Friday. No words can adequately comfort those who were emotionally and physically injured, nor relieve the pain of the families who lost loved ones. No words can erase the horror of the Weston family upon learning that their son may have committed this horrific act. And no words can adequately express the sorrow that millions of Americans feel today about this assault on our nation's heritage and democratic institutions. 
However, words can be used to remember and applaud the lives and heroism of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson. And I want to add my voice to the call today to remember those brave men and commend all the Capitol Hill police officers who put their lives on the line to protect democracy. And I want to add my voice to the call to ensure that the People's House remains open to the people, while preserving the safety of those who work and visit this great institution. 
Many of my colleagues know how indispensable and brave the Capitol Hill Police Officers are, but many other Americans learned of these brave troops just on Friday. Let me tell you what I think many people didn't really know until Friday: what a Capitol Hill Police Officer does and what makes them so special. 
These men and women are some of the most unique officers in the country. First, they are excellent federal law-enforcement officials who protect members of Congress from crooks, terrorists, or anyone else who would want to harm us and they also protect all the people in the building, whether it's a foreign dignitary, like Mr. Mandela, or a girl-scout troop from Iowa. Second, they are also `Officer Friendly'--welcoming people and answering questions and many have taken special language training to help visitors from around the world. Third, many are also trained for other possible emergencies: to provide basic paramedic help in the case of an ill tourist, or to provide basic fire-fighting and help evacuate buildings in the case of fires. 
These police are like our own `Cops on the Beat.' Many of the officers are assigned a primary beat, which means they get to know particular members and our hours and our staffs; the regular delivery people; and others. They know who are the usual folks coming in and can then detect anyone who is strange, or who is acting strange. So, just like thousands of towns across the country, Capitol Hill has its own community policemen. They have a beat, they get to know us, and we get to know them. 
And if you're on the beat, you get to know the officers on your beat. We talk about the Orioles. We talk about their families. There is always the proud dad. The one who's getting off early because his daughter is going to a prom and he's chaperoning. Or one who is the first in her family to get her college degree. 
They also get to know us. We talk to them about our own families. I know when my own mother was ill and we thought she needed surgery, they volunteered to organize a blood drive if I needed it. They told me that I never had to worry, that if I needed extra people to come to Baltimore, they would. They just said, `Don't worry, Senator Barb, we'll be there for you.' 
Finally, so many of the Capitol Hill Police Officers are my Maryland constituents, just like J.J. Chestnut. So, I'd hear if the fishing was good down in Southern Maryland, or if the traffic was congested. Officer Chestnut was from Ft. Washington in Prince Georges County. It's close to the Potomac River, and it is where a lot of our officers live. Where they can have a wonderful family life, fish in the Potomac, or, as I've learned about Officer Chestnut, tend a wonderful vegetable garden. Officer Chestnut was always one of the stars--trained as an MP in the military, he'd been with the Capitol Police for eighteen years and was known for having a unique touch with tourists and constituents. We were very proud of him and that he was even nominated at one time for Capitol Police Officer of the Year. 
And I know how proud we were of Detective Gibson as well. He was from just across the River in Virginia, and was also a star and a hero. From helping tourists to protecting dignitaries, Detective Gibson always made the safety of others his top priority. I know he was a true hero on Friday, when he stopped the gunman from entering further into the building. 
The Capitol Hill Police Officers are our hi-touch, hi-tech community police officers and we are very, very proud of them. And we are profoundly grieved at the passing of two of that force's brightest lights, Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson. 
My heart and prayers go out to their families, as they cope with their overwhelming loss. And my heart goes out to the family of the suspect, Mr. Weston. From everything I've seen and heard, Mr. Weston was mentally ill. From interviews I've seen, the Weston family is a good family and his mom and dad are absolutely grief-stricken at the thought that their son could have done such a terrible, terrible act and our thoughts and prayers should be with them, as well today. 
Mr. President, I know the entire Senate joins me in saying that this act was a horror and that no family, no nation should have to endure the pain we feel today. I know that we will honor them tomorrow in a service befitting heroes because, Madam President, they were heroes. Giving their lives so that others might be safe is the ultimate act of heroism. We know that Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson are heroes for today and all eternity. 
Madam President, I hope that as we respond, we are very careful to ensure that the public access continues to be granted here. We need to ensure that what they died for, which was defending not only the building, but what the building stands for, so that the public can always come see us doing our work while they so valiantly did their work. I thank the Chair and my colleague, the senior Senator, for yielding me this time. 
I yield the floor.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I join my good friend and colleague, Senator Harkin, in introducing a bill to allow for coverage of acupuncture services under Part B of Medicare and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). I am proud to be the lead cosponsor of this legislation. 
I like this bill for three reasons: it gives patients access to affordable, quality health care; it offers patients choice of treatment; and it lets patients decide what treatment works for them. 
Some years ago I had some very severe illnesses. Western medicine was of limited utility for me and I turned to acupuncture. Acupuncture helped me get well and has helped me stay well. Time after time, constituents have confirmed what I already know about acupuncture--it is an effective treatment for a number of conditions. 
Last November, the Western medical establishment formally endorsed what American consumers have been saying for a long time. The National Institutes of Health convened a federal panel of experts in medicine, anthropology, biostatistics, epidemiology and other scientific disciplines to discuss the validity of acupuncture as an effective treatment option. The panel concluded that there is clear evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for certain kinds of pain and nausea and may be effective for other conditions. Equally important, acupuncture has fewer side effects and is less invasive than many `traditional' medical practices. The panel decided that, given its good safety profile and the fact that it is often less expensive than conventional medicine, it's time to take acupuncture seriously. 
I think it's time that the federal government take it seriously, too. The time has come for Medicare and FEHBP to cover acupuncture for American patients who seek this treatment option. I urge the Senate to approve this legislation to allow American patients to choose this less invasive, less costly, and effective treatment option. I applaud Senator Harkin for taking the lead on this important effort.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I will not be speaking on the pending amendment. I will be speaking on the overall nature of the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations. 
I commend Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for the outstanding job that they have done in bringing an excellent bill to the floor. 
Yesterday we talked about some of the things we thought were missing from the bill, and particularly what would affect the safety and well-being of children. 
We talked about gun locks. Mr. President, I am a supporter of gun locks. If we put locks on our cars to protect our automobiles, locks on our doors to protect our property, I think we should have locks on guns to protect our children. We worked our will yesterday. That didn't pass. 
But I will tell you, the Gregg-Hollings bill brings before us a real Justice Department commitment to protect our children. I would like to thank them for that. I would like to thank them for their efforts in fighting juvenile crime. I would like to thank them for bringing us legislation to prevent violence in our schools. But most of all, I am really grateful that they have put money in this budget to fight child pornography on the Internet. We need cops on the beat, and we need cops on the computers to be able to protect our communities and our children. 
Let me share with you a story. 
There was a little boy in Prince Georges County whose parents had bought him a computer where they thought it would be an opportunity for him to learn about the world and be ready for school each and every day. However, there was a sexual predator who treated that computer as if it were a virtual playground. And they stalked that little boy, and it ended in his death. 
But thanks to the response of the U.S. Congress--and I would like to particularly thank Senator Gregg for his cooperation and leadership on this--we have actually put money into the Federal budget for the FBI to establish a special headquarters in Maryland to fight cyber-kiddieporn on the Internet, with $10 million 
bringing 60 FBI folks into this, and 25 special agents. I have been there, and I have seen what they are doing to protect our children. You would love to see these FBI agents who are making use of the newest and latest technology to be able to intervene, intercept, and detect those people who sit in chat rooms coming after our children. 
I sat with those agents. I watched the pictures on the screen. I was repulsed. I was horrified not only at what I saw, but what others could be subjected to. 
Because of our prompt response, the program is actually already working. In the short time that this committee has put money in the Federal checkbook to fight cyberporn against children, there have been 400 search warrants executed, over 200 arrests, and we are well on our way to over an 85-percent conviction rate. 
In my home State of Maryland there have been 15 arrests, 15 indictments, and 12 convictions. 
That means that we will be able to protect our children. The average child molester has more than 70 victims throughout his lifetime. 
Because of the work we have done here to put cops on the beat through our community policing in concert with the computer, both in our streets and our neighborhoods to protect our children, children's lives have been saved. 
In Maryland alone 15 child molesters have been taken off the streets. That means that 1,000 Maryland children have been saved and rescued. 
This is just part of what we are doing to protect our children. 
I know through the work of this subcommittee, of which I am proud to be a Member, $210 million has been put into the Federal checkbook for a new safe schools initiative. 
We need to hire more security guards, improve coordination with local police, get the violent kids out of our schools, and while we are doing that, in addition to the policing that we are doing, I know that this committee has put in substantial money for prevention--not the type of prevention where we don't know what is going to be shown for it. 
This committee is a tough committee. We are going to go after the crooks and the criminals and the stalkers. But we know that, if we are going to have policing and punishment, we are going to do prevention, and we are going to do it by creative activity to fight and prevent gang violence--to be able to do structured, afterschool activity; working with faith-based organizations. 
Because of the work of this subcommittee, our streets and our schools will be safer because we put cops on the beat and cops on the computers. 
I thank the chairman for allowing me to speak. But most of all, I would like to thank the ranking member for this outstanding bill.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to support Senator Hollings' amendment. This amendment puts the Senate on record in support of Saving Social Security first. It says before we do anything with the budget surplus, whether that is cutting taxes or funding worthwhile programs, we must ensure the solvency of Social Security. This is a very important vote. It expresses our commitment to the Social Security system for the millions of Americans who currently rely on Social Security. It also sends a powerful message to the millions of Americans who have come to doubt that Social Security will be there for them when they retire. 
I support this amendment because I believe that promises made must be promises kept. We must be thoughtful and cautious when addressing the needs of a system that so many Americans count on, especially elderly women and disabled children. We need to ensure that we have the resources necessary to put Social Security on a sound footing, for both the short-term and the long-term. 
Now we are in the midst of a historic event: the first federal budget surplus in decades. We've gone from a record deficit of $290 billion in the last year of the Bush Administration to a projected surplus of $80 billion for fiscal year 1998. There is no end to the proposals on how to use this `extra' money. I believe that we should follow President Clinton's lead and not commit the surplus to any program until we first resolve the long-term solvency of the Social Security system. 
When you remove the Social Security Trust Fund from the budget calculation, there is no surplus and the budget isn't balanced. The Social Security Trust Fund is an important part of our current fiscal good fortune. We must continue to work to bring the budget into true balance without counting Social Security Trust Fund balances. In the past, I have voted to remove the Social Security Trust Fund from the federal budget calculation and I will continue to do so in the future. While Social Security is still in the overall budget calculation, any budget surplus should not be used to justify new spending initiatives. Our seniors, disabled, and survivors deserve better. 
We are in the early stages of a deliberative process to determine the best way to assure the solvency of Social Security. I am pleased that President Clinton started this initiative by putting Social Security solvency front and center in his State of the Union Address. Since then, various groups, both public and private, have brought forth a vast range of proposals. I am taking part in that debate and want to be an advocate for the original intention of the Social Security program: a safety net for our seniors and for the disabled. 
Let me say again that I believe that promises made must be promises kept. I want that to be a guiding principle for any plan to modify the Social Security program. I am pleased to support this amendment that reaffirms our commitment to Saving Social Security First.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President: Twenty four years ago today, Turkish troops invaded and divided the nation of Cyprus. This illegal and immoral division of Cyprus continues today--dividing a country and creating instability in the Mediterranean. 
During the early days of the Turkish occupation, six thousand Greek-Cypriots were killed. Over two hundred thousand were driven from their homes. Many of the missing, including some Americans, have never been accounted for. 
Little has changed in the past quarter century. Today, forty thousand Turkish troops remain in Cyprus. The Greek-Cypriots who remain in the northern part of the island are denied basic human rights such as the right to a free press, freedom to travel, and access to religious sites. 
I am disappointed that we have made no progress in ending the occupation of Cyprus. Earlier this year, there were reasons to be hopeful. We thought that possible European Union membership would made Turkey more receptive to peace talks. but Turkey is not on the short list for EU membership--and Turkey responded by imposing preconditions on any negotiations. So we are far as ever from a peaceful solution for Cyprus. 
This year, as we mark this somber anniversary, I urge my colleagues to join me in recommitting ourselves to bring peace to Cyprus. 
First of all, we must continue to make the resolution of the Cyprus problem a priority. President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright have focused more attention on this region that any other Administration. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and Ambassador Tom Miller have done an excellent job trying to bring both sides together. As Ambassador Holbrooke assumes his new responsibilities at the United Nations, we must encourage the Administration to replace him with an emissary of equal stature. 
The secondary priority is that we must continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Cyprus. Each year, Congress provides fifty million dollars to foster bicommunal cooperation in Cyprus. These funds are used for education, health care, and to help both communities to solve regional problems--such as to improve water and energy supplies. 
The third priority is that Congress should pass the Enclaved People of Cyprus Act. Senator Olympia Snowe and I introduced this legislation to call for improved human rights for the Greek Cypriots living under Turkish control. 
Mr. President: The crisis in Cyprus has brought two NATO allies to the brink of war. The occupation is also a human tragedy that should enrage all of us who care about human rights. I urge my colleagues to continue to work toward a peaceful and unified Cyprus.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I stand in opposition to the Nickles amendment. Let me share why I support the FHA loan limit increase included in the Appropriations Committee bill. 
FHA is a critical tool for first time home buyers, low and moderate income buyers, and minority buyers. 
FHA will help us meet new market realities, but in a way that does not expose taxpayers and communities to a big buck liability in the event of FHA foreclosures. 
Our Senate bill will raise the FHA loan limit in high cost areas from $170,000 to $197,000. 
It will also raise the limit in low cost areas from $86,000 to $108,000. 
Mr. President, home ownership is a critical step in a person or family's attempt to obtain assets and to becoming a more permanent fixture in a community. 
Like many of my colleagues, I share the concern about the affect that foreclosures can have on individuals' credit and the stability of a community. 
My own hometown of Baltimore has been a victim of foreclosures harming neighborhoods. 
But in our bill we have provided a modest increase that does not raise the limit too much too quickly. 
Our objective is clear, for those who FHA serves, ensure that it is a useful tool. 
The objective is not to put the private mortgage insurance companies out of business or to move FHA away from providing for low and moderate income buyers. 
I believe that the FHA provision included in the Senate bill before us is good for Maryland and good for the nation. 
I believe that this is a positive step in rewarding investment and provides relief to working families. 
I encourage my colleagues to oppose the Nickles amendment and support the Appropriations Committee's attempt to help home buyers across the country. 
Mr. President, what this legislation does is provide an opportunity for first-time home ownership. It does not put private mortgage insurance companies out of business. 
It is a good thing to do.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment and support the motion to table. Yes, this subcommittee is a strong supporter of space and science and technology. We put $150 million more in the NASA budget. But we object to offsetting and cutting national service that provides the opportunity to pay for college education, in which 50,000 have earned their educational awards, a modest amount of money that could be used to help them continue their education. We have worked to improve 100,000 people who have participated in this program. 
Don't cut the habits of the heart. Don't cut the habits of the heart for space. 
Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of space programs and strongly support investments in science and technology. That's why I worked with Senator Bond  to find a $150 million increase for NASA. But, I must strongly oppose cuts to the Corporation for National Service. 
The National Service helps to promote the habits of the heart and fosters the volunteer spirit that helped make this country great. To date nearly 100,000 people have participated. They have helped to generate thousands of un-paid volunteers in communities across the country. 
The National Service provides assistance to programs like the one run by the Sisters of Notre Dame in Baltimore. This is a critical tutoring service of young people. 
Each year over 400,000 young children are tutored by AmeriCorps volunteers who work to help prepare our children to be literate and functional in the 21st century. 
Volunteers also work with well respected organizations like the Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity and the YMCA, and provide real help to meet compeling human needs. 
In addition the National Service also provides an opportunity for participants to pay for their college education. To date 50,000 have earned their educational awards. A modest amount of money is used to help our young adults. 
I urge my colleagues to stand with me as I stand behind our kids. Vote to table the Sessions amendment.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I inserted a provision in this legislation to prohibit our government from sending our great Navy ships overseas--where they are dismembered in a dangerous, irresponsible and immoral manner. The export of misery and the exploitation of workers is beneath the dignity and honor of our nation. 
I'd like to give the Senate some background on this issue. 
With the end of the Cold War the number of ships to be disposed of in the military arsenal is growing. There are 180 Navy and Maritime Administration ships waiting to be scrapped. These ships are difficult and dangerous to dismantle. They usually contain asbestos, PCB's and lead paint. They were built long before we understood all the environmental hazards associated with these materials. 
This issue was brought to my attention by a Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles that appeared in the Sun written by reporters Gary Cohn and Will Englund. 
They conducted a thorough and rigorous investigation of the way we dispose of our Navy and maritime ships. They traveled around the country and around the world to see firsthand how our ships are dismantled, and Mr. President, I must advise that the way we do this is not being done in an honorable, environmentally sensitive, or efficient way. 
I believe when we have ships that have defended the United States of America, that they were floating military bases--and they should be retired with the same care and dignity with which we close a military base. 
Let me read from the Sun series: 
As the Navy sells off warships at the end of the Cold War, a little known industry has grown up. In America's depressed ports and where the ship breaking industry goes, pollution and injured workers are left in its wake. 
The Pentagon repeatedly deals with ship breakers with dismal records, then fails to keep watch as they leave health, environmental and legal problems in their wake. 
Of the 58 ships sold for scrapping since 1991, only 28 have been finished. And oh, my God, how they have been finished. I would like to turn to my own hometown of Baltimore. 
In Baltimore the dismantling of the Coral Sea has been a disaster. There were fires, lawsuits, delays--and injuries. The Navy inspector refused to board the Coral Sea because he was afraid it was too dangerous. 
I am quoting now the Sun paper. `September 16, 1993, the military sent its lone inspector for the United States to the salvage yard in Baltimore. He didn't inspect it because he thought it was too dangerous.' 
The inspector was right to be concerned about his own safety. The next day a 23 year-old worker found out how safe it would be. 
He walked on a flight deck and he dropped 30 feet from the hangar. `I felt the burning feeling inside,' he said, `blood was coming out of my mouth, I didn't think I would live.' He suffered a fractured spleen, pelvis, and broke his arms in several places. 
At the same time we had repeated fires that were breaking out. In November of 1996, a fire broke out in the Coral Sea's engine room. No one was standing fire watch. No hose nearby. The blaze burned quickly out of control and for the sixth time Baltimore City's fire department had to come in and rescue a shipyard. At the same time the owner of the shipyard had a record of environmental violations - a record for which he ultimately was sentenced to jail. 
While all of this has been going on, the Navy also planned to send our ships overseas--where worker and environmental safety are virtually ignored. 
In India, the Sun paper found a tidal beach where 35,000 men scrapped the world ships with little more than their bare hands. They worked under wretched conditions. 
They often dismantle ships with their bare hands. They earn just a couple of dollars a day. They have no hard hats, no training. Every day, someone dies breaking these ships. 
I will quote from the Sun series: 
They live in hovels built of scrap, with no showers, toilets or latrines. They have come from poor villages on the other side of India, lured by wages that start at one dollar and fifty cents a day, to work at dangerous jobs, protected only by scarves and sandals. 
They suffer broken ankles, severed fingers, smashed skulls, malaria fevers, dysentery and tuberculosis. Some are burned and some are drowned. Nobody keeps track of how many die here from accidents and disease. Some say a worker dies every day. 
This is an international disgrace. 
So I introduced legislation to prohibit the overseas sales of government owned ships to countries with poor labor and environmental records. I inserted similar language in the VA-HUD appropriations bill that we are considering today. 
This is not a ban on exports. Ships could be exported to countries that can break ships responsibly. 
This limitation on exports would only be in effect for one year. This would enable the Navy to come up with a more ethical, workable plan for exports. This one year pause in exports would also enable us to improve our ability to dispose of ships here in the U.S. This will provide American jobs, and will strengthen our shipbuilding industrial base. 
Some say that it is cheaper to send our ships to India and other developing countries. It is cheaper. Why? Because workers earn one dollar and fifty cents a day. They work eighteen hours a day. They have no training and no protection. They die or are maimed in terrible, preventable accidents. 
It is always cheaper to exploit workers--and it is always wrong. 
I would like to thank the Sun paper for their outstanding service in bringing this not only to my attention but to America's attention. Now the Senate must act to end these shameful policies. 
The Sun reporters won the Pulitzer prize. But I want the United States of America to be sure that we win a victory here today for workers, the environment--and especially for the Navy. Because I know our Navy wants to do the right, honorable thing. 
I hope my colleagues will agree with me that the practice of exploiting foreign workers and ignoring the environment is beneath the dignity of our great Navy, and of our nation.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for raising this issue. It is never too late to raise the issue about the quality of care that our veterans get. That means we need to be able to retain the very best from our nurses. The Senator has brought to our attention an issue which I believe has not been raised before. As we move to conference, you have the assurance of your colleague on this side of the aisle, we will look into the matters raised and see how we can do the redress in conference, if a remedy is necessary. 
But you have really brought something to our attention. It is important to the nurses who give care that they get paid and are retained, and we say thank you by adequate pay. Second, it has a direct impact on veterans' care, because the more we retain the best, the better care they get. So I thank the Senator from Connecticut.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, first, I thank the 
leadership--the Republican leader and the Democratic leader--for giving us a window of opportunity which enabled us to move the bill. Yes, it was late at night, but we did due diligence and deliberation. I am proud to support the final passage of this bill. It is good for the Nation; it is good for my own home State. 
We provide increases for veterans' medical care and veterans research. We fought to restore cuts in elderly housing, and we provided increases in the high-tech future through NASA and the National Science Foundation. We are going to get behind our kids in terms of the funding for national service and those wonderful informal science programs at the NSF. 
We worked to protect our environment, as well as stand sentry to help our communities in the event of a disaster. I was particularly pleased to work on a bipartisan effort to increase antiterrorist efforts in the FEMA program and to make sure that we protect our Nation from any foe, domestic or foreign. That is our oath, and that is what we will do. 
Also in this funding, we look for those important things that look out for the Chesapeake Bay and deal with important research on pfiesteria. 
Madam President, this is a good bill. I was pleased to work with Senator Bond. Again, this is a partisan-free zone that we had called for. I thank him. I thank his professional staff for their very professional behavior. I thank my own staff for the hard work that they put into this bill, and I look forward to working in conference and perhaps getting our conference done before the August recess. 
Madam President, that concludes my remarks on this bill. Again, thanks to John Kamarck, Carolyn Apostolou, Andy Givens, David Bowers, and Bertha Lopez.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to concur with Senators Cleland and Bond on this amendment. It will increase by $13 million the amount for the homeless grants for the VA. Nobody who fought to save our country should be out on the street. These men have borne the permanent wounds of war, some of which have caused deep-seated emotional problems--unable to find a job. 
What I like about the VA homeless program is, it not only provides a shelter but tries to get them focused on starting a new way of life. We have an outstanding one in Maryland. I am proud of it. And I look forward to accepting this amendment and say hats off to try to give the vets a new lease on life.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this does attempt to recruit the very best and brightest in the field of primary care to the VA. I proposed the debt reduction program, a student debt reduction program, back in 1992. 
Now, why do I approach this as debt reduction rather than scholarships? The scholarship program is very worthwhile, but there are many very talented people who have already graduated. They have a substantial student debt from studying either nursing or other primary care practices. What the $5 million would do would go towards reducing their student debt if they would enter VA services; they would get a year's worth of debt reduction for a year's worth of service. 
This way, we know they have completed their training, they have passed their licensing requirement, they are as fit for duty as the veterans they will serve. That is why we approached it from that policy standpoint. It also joins with the outstanding efforts being made by Senator Rockefeller to also develop other tools. 
I concur in the amendment, and I urge its adoption and ask it be accepted unanimously.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to thank Senator Wellstone for his cooperation in this debate, and for his willingness to stay on the floor. I also appreciate his remarks. I know the passion that the Senator from Minnesota has on behalf of veterans. He spoke in behalf of atomic veterans, and in behalf of a group of veterans in his own State that have been ignored. He has spoken for the homeless, for the mentally ill veterans, and also for the need for long-term care for the veterans. I thank him for that. 
Mr. President, when we debated both the highway bill and the budget bill, I supported the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that we not raid the veterans' medical care. Thence, when we voted on the highway bill, I voted for final passage, but was very clear saying we should not fix America's potholes on the backs of America's veterans and their needs for health care, many of whom bear the permanent wounds of war. 
I thank the Senator for raising this issue again. I want the Senator from Minnesota to know that I support his policy position on this. I, too, believe that promises made should be promises kept to the veterans, and we should find other ways of funding that highway bill. 
I look forward to further work with him on this topic.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Nickles amendment. 
I wish to associate myself with the remarks by the chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, as well as the senior Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, who also is the ranking member on the Housing, Banking, and Urban Affairs Committee. Senator Sarbanes outlined, I think in rather solid, logical terms, exactly why the Nickles amendment really is, though well-intentioned, flawed in its public policy ramifications, as did Senator Bond. 
I must say that initially, when Secretary Cuomo came and presented this idea, I really raised my eyebrows. I thought, my gosh, FHA--he wanted to raise the limit to $227,000. That is a quarter of a million dollars. That is a lot of money. Now, from the time I either chaired the subcommittee or now, as ranking, it has been my passion and my commitment to public policy to expand opportunities for first-time home ownership, and two significant tools were in the VA-HUD Subcommittee--the VA mortgage itself, which has been a significant empowerment tool for minorities and for others who might have been really segregated out of the mortgage market, and also FHA has been very, very important in terms of first-time home buyers. 
But yet as we looked at the facts, it really became important for us to lift the limit, and we felt that a reasonable approach would be to raise the FHA loan limit in high-cost areas, many of which are in my State, from $170,000 to $197,000, and also to raise the limit in low-cost areas from $86,000 to $108,000, which are also in my State, and to streamline the downpayment calculations to reduce administrative costs and burdens. 
The administration wanted to have just that one limit of $227,000 for all communities. I do not believe that one size fits all. I do believe we need to recognize the realities of the market. 
In addition to that, we are concerned about foreclosures, and we did not want to risk people getting into so much debt early in their lives or risking the loss of a home because they got in over their heads. We did not want to end up with heartbreak for the families and heartburn for the taxpayers. 
I believe what we have here is a good middle ground. Included in the language, in addition to the mortgage, we direct HUD to consult with Congress before beginning its bulk sale of foreclosed properties so that we can deal with the way they deal with foreclosed properties, which I am not happy about and I know the Presiding Officer is not either. I do not want to see those properties go at fire sale prices or end up blighting a community when it should have been a tool of empowerment. The Federal Government ends up being a slum landlord, selling it to someone who either cannot afford it or chooses to use it to downgrade the neighborhood. FHA should be a tool for first-time home buyers and not a tool for neighborhood deterioration. 
Let me just give you some figures from Maryland and why I think this bill is good for Maryland and also good for the Nation. There are three counties in Maryland at the current low end limit of $86,000. They are Allegany, Garrett, and Somerset. And I also know Dorchester sits somewhere in there as well. In Garrett, the realtors report that the median home price is $124,000 in a county where the FHA limit is $86,000. That is a poor county. FHA is a very important tool. It is not a poor county, but it is of very modest means. 
Eleven counties out of our 23 and Baltimore have limits at the FHA limit of $170,000, yet in Montgomery County housing the median price is $174,000. Raising these limits, I note, could help create 2,000 new home buyers in the State of Maryland. 
Well, Mr. President, that talks about Maryland, and I have a whole set of facts here on why it would be good for the Nation and also why increasing the Ginnie Mae fees would really give me pause, and I absolutely oppose raising the Ginnie Mae fees. 
What applies in Maryland will also apply in many communities around the country. 
This is especially true in many urban high cost areas, particularly in the Northeast and California. It is also true that in many rural areas in the heartland of the country. FHA does not meet the local market realities. 
HUD estimates that the provision we have included in our bill will provide for 17,000 new home buyers annually and generate $80 million a year in revenue for the FHA fund. 
HUD estimates the Senate's FHA increase will raise the limits in 32 high-cost metropolitan areas and 174 lower cost areas. 
But let's be clear; we're not talking about buying a place, but we are talking about buying a home. It is estimated that the average loan amount under the Senate proposal will only be $142,000. 
We have raised the limits enough to meet today's market realities without unduly increasing the risks for foreclosures. 
FHA is also a critical resource to fill the gap for potential home buyers who are credit worthy, but don't have the money for large down payments. Two-thirds of FHA loans have down payments of 5 percent or less, while only 8 percent of private mortgage insurance purchases are low down payment loans. 
Why oppose the Nickles amendment? Two reasons: it eliminates the high-cost area increase and increases GNMA fees by 6 basis points, from 6 to 12.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, concur with the chairman. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his leadership. The facts speak for themselves. The situation in Baltimore of 22 percent of children in Baltimore city have some type of lead in their blood, this is a serious issue. I won't go into all the public health aspects and pediatric consequences this late. But I will tell you what it means. 
It means lower intellectual achievement. It means a lethargy, a sluggishness that is perpetual. Unless the child has their blood chelated, and if you go into Johns Hopkins and you are going to have your blood chelated because there was lead paint dust on your mom's kitchen table that kind of got mixed up with after-school cookies, then it is going to cost $8,000 in Medicaid to clean out your blood. 
Even if we can clean that blood out, we can't necessarily clean out the consequences that have already set this child back, particularly in cognitive development. 
I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for raising this, to move it up. 
I am glad we can finally accept it with an offset. I asked that I be a cosponsor of the amendment. And we know that we need more research. We need the type of licensed people to be able to clean out the lead paint and protect our children. I view this as an important public health, get-behind-our-kids initiative. I look forward to just accepting it and defending it in conference.

Ms. MIKULSKI. If the Senator from Nebraska will yield, the suggestion by the Senator from Missouri is not to deny the Senator from Nebraska from presenting his arguments. What it does do is give us a framework for moving on these other two amendments and it relieves us of our responsibility to conduct our business. It doesn't preclude the Senator from Nebraska from talking. 
If the Senator will yield further, why would talking while we two are here accomplish what you want to accomplish, beyond what we have already discussed? I don't understand why you are objecting to morning business when we are not in any way asking you to give up your right to continue to speak.

Ms. MIKULSKI. First of all, I appreciate the willingness of the Senator from Nebraska to actually withdraw the amendment. The Senator from Missouri has my absolute assurance to work for report language or another acceptable approach that would deal with the compelling issue that he raised about the State of Nebraska. This would mean working with the appropriate authorizers. It also means working with the Administrator. We are willing to work with the Senator. 
We understand that Nebraska comes under a rule where there are consequences with excessive copper--with nausea, diarrhea, and other things. They might not affect anybody in Nebraska, but there are consequences. We are not going to debate science tonight. 
What we want to let the Senator know is, first of all, we appreciate the Senator's withdrawing the amendment. The Senator has our assurance we will work with him to advance this so that Nebraska's small communities do not have to make these expensive expenditures to comply with a rule that might in that State have either no or limited utility. We all have examples in our States. And the consequences, particularly to small, rural areas, are quite severe. 
I have had to confront some of these issues in Maryland myself. I won't give the examples because of the time. But I know what it is like for a county not to have a lot of money, to maybe have to go into bonds to be able to do that and then, having to spend their bond money, they can't build another school, another library, buy another computer for a child. So we understand that and look forward to working with the Senator. The Senator has my assurance we will work with him in conference.

Ms. MIKULSKI. I rise in opposition to the Sessions amendment. I really respect the Senator from Alabama and his deep commitment to space and to the significant investments that must be made in science if America is to be a leader in the 21st century. 
I have been to the Huntsville NASA program where they are doing a significant amount of the space station work, along with so many other worthwhile projects, and can see why he would have such a passion both from a patriotic standpoint, a competitive standpoint, and in actually seeing it hands on. I do not dispute the need to increase NASA's budget. Both the chairman and I have really dealt with this issue as forcibly as we could. 
Given our parameters, we felt that we have come up with essentially a funding for NASA that keeps crucial and critical programs, that keeps us exploring, keeps the Shuttle safe, and continues our work in Earth observatory data. What I object to, though, in the amendment of the Senator from Alabama, is his offset. He takes the offset of $33 million from the Corporation for National and Community Service. That program, too, has been flatlined for more than 3 years. 
When we talk about national and community service, let me just say what it is. This corporation makes grants to States, institutions of higher education, and public and nonprofit organizations to create service opportunities. But most of all, one of its most significant programs is to have volunteers in communities. If you are an AmeriCorps volunteer, you get a voucher to reduce your student debt or to be able to use that voucher to either go to college, higher education, vocational education, or get yourself ready for the future. 
Essentially, it is an earned-learned service opportunity. I could ask the Senator from Alabama a series of questions but I will not. But if we are going to talk about $33 million, know that $5 million in this program is to continue the Points of Light Foundation established by President Bush which we have supported in a bipartisan way. It is also $18 million from the Civilian Conservation Corps. I cannot support cutting $18 million for the Civilian Conservation Corps. So $5 million, $18 million, and we are up to $23 million. I really do not want to cut Points of Light. I really do not want to cut the Civilian Conservation Corps. 
Then there is $43 million for school-based and community-based service learning. I think we do need to teach values. I do think we need to teach habits of the heart, and service learning is one of the most important ways we could do that. 
The benefits in my State, my State of Maryland, show that when students have participated in volunteer services as part of the requirement to graduate from high school, they have been forever changed by the fact that they worked in a library, visited senior citizens, helped in a soup kitchen and did a whole series of other things. 
Mr. President, tonight is not the night to extol the virtues of the Corporation for National and Community Service, but it has served the Nation very well. It, too, has been flatlined. 
I will just conclude by saying this. There is a program in Baltimore, it is an old convent called St. Stanislaus Convent right down the street from where I lived in a neighborhood called Fells Point. It has been recycled where Catholic nuns and AmeriCorps volunteers are working with children from very poor families--really out of the public housing projects. Because of what the AmeriCorps volunteers bring, they recruit other volunteers to help the sisters be able to educate these children. 
When we talk about exploring the future, we have to get behind our kids to make sure that our kids have the skills that they need to get ready for this future. And what AmeriCorps does in many ways is that the very volunteers work in public education, work to be able to recruit people for an American roots program, and gets them ready for the exciting opportunities that we have. 
So while we want to go into space to explore--I want to make sure we look for yet unidentified planets--I want to make sure we have those programs that make sure that we get our kids ready to be able to work in these science and technology programs. And I believe the AmeriCorps program helps do that. And, therefore, I urge rejection of the Sessions amendment.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this side of the aisle accepts the amendment offered by Senators Bond and Ashcroft. I commend the Senators from Missouri for bringing this to our national attention. 
It obviously points out this despicable drug has two negative consequences. It is horrendous and devastating to anyone who takes it, but it is also dangerous in where it is made, and innocent people, innocent children nearby, are unwittingly exposed to and even in additional danger around its manufacturer. 
We want to support this amendment. I believe we need those steps to get crime out of public housing. Public housing should be an opportunity to lead a better life, not an incubator for small business drug trafficking.

Ms. MIKULSKI. I concur with the observations of the Senator from Minnesota. There is a disturbingly large gap between the number of units of affordable housing and the number of families in need. Savings from HUD property disposition reform should go to federal housing assistance in some form. As a clarification, would it be correct to say that my Colleague from Missouri agrees with the Senator from Minnesota and myself that if savings could be found within the HUD accounts, that housing programs would be a primary target for such funds? 
Mr. BOND: That is correct. I also want to emphasize that the reform of FHA property disposition is critical, but needs to be designed to ensure that property disposition helps to protect distressed communities, where applicable.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as we close the debate on the fiscal year 1999 VA/HUD bill, I thank Chairman Bond, first, for all the courtesies that he has extended both to myself and to my staff during the entire year that we have considered this legislation--many hearings, many discussions, many issues that we ironed out so we could come to the floor with the bill that really met compelling human need and investment in the future. 
And at the same time, avoid a lot of the wrangling that sometimes can surround appropriations bills. I also think he handled the bill tonight with great deftness. We want to thank him. I want to thank his staff, Carolyn Apostolou and Jon Kamarck for the outstanding job they did. Of course, I could not stand here and be able to articulate the position of both my party and my own beliefs without my very able staff. I thank Andy Givens, David Bowers and Bertha Lopez, who were with me throughout the entire year as we moved this bill. 
So I look forward to voting for the bill tomorrow and in conference. And really, for all of the pages who have worked so late, they should know that this bill has really helped. We have housing for the poor and have saved the environment, invested in the future. I could go on, but I am going to now yield the floor.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act conference report that is before us today. I supported the Senate bill in May and, although this report has unrelated items that should be debated on their own merits, I will support this conference report because it will change the culture of the IRS by focusing on customer service. This new culture will improve the way the IRS interacts with individual taxpayers, IRS employees, and tax-exempt groups. 
As we know from our constituents, the IRS has engaged in some horrible management practices. It has been rightfully described as an agency out of control. I am particularly furious about the documented harassment of taxpayers. In my state of Maryland, I have heard from many Veterans groups across the state and a volunteer fire company in Western Maryland about harassment at the hands of the IRS. 
Let me give you some examples. The Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion Posts in my state have been systematically audited over the past five to six years because they sell drinks and food to members' guests. The Veterans groups tell me that their sign-in book was confiscated, people were subpoenaed, and IRS agents threatened to lock them up. Amazingly, the American Legion was told by the IRS that they could not hire an attorney or a CPA out of Post funds to help them with the audits! 
These Posts offer our vets fellowship, entertainment, and a place to bring their families for an affordable meal. Yet, their very existence has been put in doubt by the actions of the IRS. What is their crime? They sell drinks and food to their post members and their guests, a little beer and a little bingo and a lot of the IRS. Let me tell you, this has got to end. 
In Frederick County, the Emmitsburg volunteer fire company used `tip jars' to raise money to purchase a fire truck. The Frederick County Commissioners passed a local gaming law that makes it legal and less bureaucratic for non-profits like the fire company to place `tips jars' in local taverns by eliminating the need for county tax processors to get involved. However, the fire company was audited by the IRS and was told it owes close to $29,000 in back federal taxes because the money raised was not funneled through the local county tax authority in the customary manner. 
I find it very troubling that any of our government agencies would accuse the men and women who protected our country of being tax evaders and tax cheaters. I take much satisfaction that these methods will not be tolerated in the new IRS. After we pass this legislation, the IRS will be a more customer focused organization and will have a separate division dedicated solely to working with members of the tax-exempt sector, like our veterans groups and volunteer fire companies. 
Mr. President, I also want to recognize the hard work of many at the Internal Revenue Service. We need to recognize that most IRS workers are good, faithful employees, doing their best to serve the public. Many employees at the IRS are my constituents. I know that every day they go to work, do a good job, and then return to their families, their neighborhoods and their communities throughout Maryland. 
In light of all the negative talk about the IRS recently, I want them to know that I value their work as faithful employees and I thank them. I realize that the front-line employees of the IRS often receive little recognition and little thanks. It pleases me that this legislation will help the employees at the IRS make their voices heard, and to receive the updated technology they need to allow the cultural and technological changes to succeed at the new IRS. 
Finally, I wish to address what I consider to be a major abuse of the legislative process that I mentioned before. As we all know and are suppose to respect, the purpose of a House-Senate conference is to produce a report that irons out the differences between similar legislation passed by the two houses of Congress. It is not intended to be a backdoor, behind-the-scenes, under-the-table method of getting controversial items passed on popular bills. There are two such provisions included in this conference report today and that's why I supported Senators Dorgan and Murray in their efforts to recommit the conference report back to conference. 
The first goes against one of my principles for maintaining our robust economy. I believe that we should reward patient capital. We should discourage the two-hour investments in hot IPOs and encourage the two-year or longer investments in start-up biotech firms that are important for our new global economy. That's why I was pleased that the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act included a lower capital gains rate for assets held for 18 months or longer. I am disappointed that this IRS reform conference report includes language that will remove that important economic incentive. 
The other provision that was inserted in the legislative darkness was a backdoor way of preventing serious debate on technical corrections to the ISTEA legislation. Many of us in the Senate are concerned because the ISTEA bill deprived our Veterans of important benefits. It was agreed that these benefits should be restored in a corrections bill. However, the leadership thought it would be best to include these `corrections' in this conference report, where they can't be amended. But our veterans will be harmed by this backdoor strategy and I will join with my colleagues to restore these benefits to our honored veterans who served their country. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased this conference report to restructure the Internal Revenue Service has arrived. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so that every American taxpayer is treated with respect and dignity when dealing with the Internal Revenue Service.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Wellstone amendment and am an enthusiastic cosponsor of it. 
I come to the Senate floor as a professionally trained social worker. I have been through seven welfare reforms in my career, both as a social worker in the streets and neighborhoods, and now in the corridors of the U.S. Senate. When we talk about reforming welfare, we want to make sure that welfare is not a way of life but that it is a tool to move to a better life. 
Over the break I sat in a room in Baltimore meeting with welfare mothers who wanted exactly to move to a better life and who were practicing self-help. But the very cruel rules of government are going to derail their hopes, dreams, and practical opportunities. And what is that? They were enrolled in a community college program--one in business, one as an addiction counselor, and one doing prenursing courses to make sure they could get back to society and be able to give an income to their family. But they were told they had to leave the program. They had to leave the program and look for work rather than complete the program so that they could have jobs that were truly self-supporting and sustaining. Why were they told that? Not because of a callous social worker. We are not callous. But the rules of government said you can get some kind of temp training. You can get into a training program where you can get some type of training that might or might not take you to a livable wage. 
That is not what welfare reform is all about. Welfare reform is to end the culture of poverty. And yet the very rules that we now have reinforce the culture of poverty. We are not giving help to those who want to practice self-help--meaning those who want to go to school, stay in school, and learn the skills for the new global economy, whether it is in the service field, the nonprofit, or the private sector. 
The Wellstone amendment allows States, if they so choose--I happen to have the type of Governor who would be eager to have this--to allow these women to be able to go into a job training program or have 2 years of higher education. 
There are people--there are women now on welfare who because of a bad choice in marriage actually dropped out of college. They might be 18 credits away. If we could help them finish, they would be able to have a job with benefits and be able to lead, indeed, a better life. 
The Wellstone amendment is not about new rules. It is about opportunity. The other side of the aisle, and this side of the aisle, has said one of the most important functions of government is to create an opportunity ladder. This is what the Wellstone amendment does. It creates an opportunity ladder that doesn't necessarily take you to the top but gets you over the top. 
I support the Wellstone amendment. I want to compliment the Senator from Minnesota for his steadfast commitment to children, but to know that for the children, they need a parent who has the best social program, which is a job that pays a living wage. And this is the best way to get one. 
I look forward to voting for the amendment, supporting the amendment, and I look forward to seeing to it that those women I talked to are able to get on with their life while we get on with doing our job.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1882, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. I commend my colleagues, especially Senators Kennedy, Jeffords, Coats and Dodd, for all their hard work in putting together a bi-partisan education bill to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. I congratulate you for producing a package aimed at the needs of our students in paying for college and getting a quality education. This bill truly helps us to get behind our kids and our students. It lays the groundwork for the future in working toward a strong economy by educating our citizens and future leaders. 
This bill contains may important provisions reauthorizing the range of student financial assistance. I support this bill for three reasons, in particular. First, it contains important provisions that expand our teacher training programs. Second, it increases the maximum amount needy students can receive under the Pell Grant program. Third, it encourages new teachers to serve elementary and secondary schools in low-income areas by providing loan forgiveness for their Stafford loans. 
Training our teachers is one of the most important steps we can take toward improving education today. Our children deserve to be taught by well-qualified teachers in every classroom. We need more teachers, but we need more quality teachers. That is why I cosponsored Senator Kennedy's and Senator Reed's proposals to provide grants to local partnerships for teacher training. I am happy to see that many of the provisions in these two bills were included in this legislation. These grants will be made to local partnerships and are designed to encourage the reform and improvement of education at the local level. 
Second, I am very pleased that this bill increases the amounts available to students for Pell Grants. This bill continues the historic commitment of our government to grant aid to the neediest students by increasing the Pell Grant to $5,000. Education should be an opportunity for all people, regardless of their financial status. Education should be both accessible and affordable. We have an obligation to make sure that every single citizen of our country has the chance to go to school, get an education, get a good job and a boost up the opportunity ladder. 
Third, this bill provides loan forgiveness for Stafford loans to teachers who choose to teach in elementary and secondary schools in low-income areas. It authorizes the Secretary of Education to repay certain loans made to borrowers who become full-time teachers for three consecutive school years in a high-poverty area. This section combines our commitment to a quality public education for all students with our commitment to also target the areas in highest need. It provides incentives for well-trained teachers to teach in areas that really need committed and well trained teachers. This bill helps ensure that we are meeting the needs of all of our students by targeting funds to those high need areas. 
Let me briefly mention two other provisions of this bill that are of special importance to me. I am very pleased to see that the Thurgood Marshal Legal Education Opportunity Program, legislation that I cosponsored with Senator Sarbanes, was included in the manager's package of this bill. This amendment will help qualified disadvantaged students gain admission to law school and help prepare them for their legal education. It identifies socially and economically disadvantaged law students and provides them with both financial and academic support services. This program has a 29 year record of assisting these disadvantaged students and I am proud to have been a strong supporter of this program. 
Mr. President, I would also like to thank Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for including language in the manager's package that doubles the authorization of federal funds that do not have to matched by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities graduate programs. This will greatly help our HBCU graduate programs increase their quality of programs. It follows our important commitment to support our Historically Black Colleges and Universities. I am particularly happy that both HBCU graduate programs in my state at Morgan State University and Eastern Shore will benefit from this important amendment. 
Mr. President, this bill represents a real investment in the education of our youth. It represents, as it should, a bipartisan effort to ensure the quality and affordability of education for all. Education can and should be something that we can all agree on. We will all have to live in the future with the decisions we make now on education. We are responsible for our future, and that means we are responsible for making sure that our children are equipped to deal with the issues they will be facing.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding young Maryland woman, Jenny Chuasiriporn. Yesterday, Jenny, a 20-year-old amateur golfer, placed second in the U.S. Women's Open following a `sudden death' round with the ultimate winner, Se Ri Pak. Although Jenny did not place first in the U.S. Women's Open, she won a place in my heart and in the hearts of many others. 
Jenny Chuasiriporn is a senior at Duke University and is from Timonium, Maryland. Her pursuit of excellence in golf is truly a family affair. Her 21-year-old brother, Joey, was her caddy and coach. Her parents were also at the Blackwolf Run Golf Course in Wisconsin to cheer on their daughter, having closed up their family business, the Bangkok Place restaurant on York Road, to be with her. 
Now, I will be the first to admit that I do not share much with Jenny in regard to the quality of my golf game. My golf handicap is pretty close to the height of the Washington Monument! But I do think I'm a pretty good putter. And I know from first hand experience that the game of golf takes an extraordinary amount of concentration and consistency to drive down the fairway, angle that chip shot, and putt slowly and surely. Jenny has that great concentration and consistency. She is and will be a great golfer. I, on the other hand, will stick with the Senate! 
Jenny also exhibited strong endurance. On Sunday, she hit a forty foot birdie putt that forced the tournament into a playoff round. After an 18-hole playoff round, the game was still tied between Jenny and Se Ri. Then the tournament went into what they call a `sudden death' round. It was the first sudden death round in the U.S. Women's Open 53-year history. Finally, on the second hole of `sudden death', Se Ri Pak hit an 18-foot birdie to win the tournament. But Jenny Chuasiriporn, the young Maryland amateur, had held on tight for five long days of golf and can surely call herself a winner. 
More and more Americans are turning to golf as a recreational sport. Jenny Chuasiriporn's game is not recreational. Hers is a game of hard work. Jenny and Se Ri went through weeds and water trying to win the tournament. That is not your typical Saturday afternoon golf game. Jenny played tough golf against seasoned professionals for five days, on the tough Blackwolf Run Golf Course in Wisconsin. That does not even count the endless hours she put in at school and home practicing for this day. She takes this game seriously and works hard at being the best. 
She went further in the 1998 U.S. Women's Open than any other amateur in 30 years. No one has done what Jenny Chuasiriporn did in 30 years. Once again Jenny, I pay tribute to your achievement, and your amazing concentration, endurance, and hard work. You make Maryland and our Nation proud.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, rise in opposition to the Bumpers amendment to strike the funding for the space station. 
We have heard, prior to Senator Bond's speech, from a distinguished American. Senator Bond is also a distinguished American, but Senator Bumpers, the Senator from Arkansas, has really raised very important and significant flashing yellow lights regarding the space station. He has raised questions related to the funding of the space station; also, as to whether we are getting our money's worth in terms of research, wouldn't it be better deployed in other areas? And he has consistently raised many of those questions over the years. 
The result of that has been that, while he has not always won his amendment, he has certainly won our attention, that of those on the Appropriations Committee, and the attention also of the space agency itself that has resulted, I believe, in greater management efficiencies and a greater focus on specific research outcomes than would have been the case had those important issues not been raised. 
Senator Bumpers has been a champion particularly in the area of health care and medical research. I remember when I first arrived in the Senate, he was the leading advocate to make sure we had adequate immunization for the children of the United States of America, and what is now a standard public policy he raised and he supported, and we thank him for that. 
He also speaks eloquently of the funding for the National Institutes of Health, and I, too, join him on that. I hope by the year 2000 or thereabouts, in the new century, we double the funding for the National Institutes of Health, an agency that resides in my own State but really belongs to all of America and really benefits the entire world. 
I feel so strongly about the benefits that could be derived from the collaboration between NIH and NASA that I encouraged then Administrator Goldin and the Director of NIH then, Dr. Bernadine Healy, to really develop joint research projects. And they actually entered into a memorandum of agreement that stands today to ensure collaborative research in that area, a great deal of which is being manifested in the space station research arena. 
So, we thank Senator Bumpers for the yellow flashing lights that he continues to signal to the committee. We thank him for his steadfast advocacy for biomedical research. And we want to thank him for his important contribution. 
However, having then said those accolades, we do not want his amendment supported. I think another wonderful American, Senator John Glenn, has outlined very clearly and extensively why we should continue to support Space Station Freedom. I would not duplicate, but hope to amplify, Senator Glenn's remarks. I recall I was a young social worker when Senator Glenn himself had just finished orbiting the Earth looking for these important scientific breakthroughs, and I think of the year 1968 when we also orbited the Moon and our astronauts read from Genesis in space to remind us all of our link between here, the planet Earth, and outer space. 
I also remember that many Democrats, members of my own party, ridiculed the whole effort to go to the Moon and to take that `one giant step for mankind.' In fact, one Senator from Minnesota at that time called it `moondoggle.' No one looks back on the success of that endeavor, what it meant to our country both in terms of national prestige and scientific breakthroughs in that era of the cold war, and no one would call that program, now, `moondoggle.' I hope we will not also just dismiss, in the same way, Space Station Freedom. 
This endeavor was begun under Ronald Reagan, sustained under President George Bush, and continues to be supported by President Bill Clinton. But it is not only the Presidential support that gives this program validity, it is also the support of the scientific community. I would like to bring to the committee's attention the Nobel laureate, Dr. Samuel Ting, who has played a major role in developing much of the research on the space station. 
Another Nobel laureate, Dr. Herbert Hauptman, has addressed the Biomedical Research Caucus of Congress on the value of orbital research for biomedicine. 
Dr. Michael DeBakey of Baylor Medicine said: 
The space station is not a luxury any more than a medical research center at Baylor College of Medicine is a luxury. 
Since 1992, NASA has signed 20 different cooperative agreements with NIH. The National Academy of Sciences has repeatedly expressed its support for research on the space station. The Planetary Society supports it. The American Medical Association has adopted a resolution in support of it. The Society for In Vitro Biology hosts an annual workshop on what culturing cells in microgravity will mean. 
Who knows what breakthroughs we will find? 
I have five pages of quotes from different deans and professors of medical schools from all over the United States of America in support of this. They range from MIT, to Harvard Medical School, to the Harvard Institutes of Medicine; Brigham and Women's Hospital. I could go on about it. 
Let me quote Dr. Jessup who heads up the Deaconess Hospital, Harvard Medical School: 
The space program offers a chance to improve out models of cancer and to develop new drugs and treatments as well as to gain knowledge about how cancer spreads . . . 
The space station is the place to do it. 
Mr. President, my family was affected by two major diseases: Alzheimer's and diabetes. My very dear father died of Alzheimer's, and I am deeply committed to continuing the research to find either the cure or the ability to stretch out the intellectual ability for anyone who has it. My dear mother was stricken with diabetes and overcame her in her final years and resulted in her death. 
What I think about now, as I listen to scientists brief us on what this means, is it is outstanding, in those two areas, and what it will mean. Let me tell you about what Dr. Ken Kosik of the Harvard Institute says: 
By raising rats in an environment that lacks gravity, we have the opportunity to zero in specifically on the brain system that controls orientation. This brain system is exactly the part of the brain attacked by Alzheimer's disease. We will use the rats to search for the specific molecules which fail to appear in the brain circuits controlling orientation. 
And this could lead to incredible breakthroughs in knowing how to help those who have Alzheimer's or a propensity to it. 
I have a quote from a letter from Dr. Jim Mulvihill, the president and CEO of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International encouraging the support of the space station because of what it will mean. 
Dr. Murray Loew, member of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Lay Review Committee, at Georgetown says: 
Although it may not be immediately apparent, persons with diabetes and astronauts share some of the same challenges. Consequently, NASA and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation last May signed a joint Space Act Agreement so that both organizations can together begin fully sharing informa-tion . . . 
And research in juvenile diabetes, there are links here to do this. I could elaborate on this, but I turn to my colleague from Missouri, and ask him if the time agreement is ready.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I acknowledge the validity of what Senator Bumpers has raised about cost overruns, and I also raise the validity about what Senator Bumpers has raised with NASA over the fact that the cost overruns in the space station could lead to raids on other well-managed NASA programs. To that end, working on a bipartisan basis with our colleague from Missouri, the chairman of the subcommittee, we established a separate account dedicated solely to the space station to create better accountability and financial management of this program and transparency in terms of the total cost of what the International Space Station is. 
So it is not a million bucks here, 100 million tucked in over here, and so on. We are going to have a separate account providing accountability and transparency. 
I would like to continue with my arguments, but we have reached a time agreement. I temporarily yield the floor to my colleague from Missouri so he can propound his unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent to return to speaking on the amendment.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I believe this amendment is a choice between the future and the past. We must be willing to embrace science and technology, to take the bold risk in scientific endeavors of the future like the space station. Investments in science and technology will be determinative of the 21st century in what nations will continue to lead the world. I do not want the American century to come to a close without a continued commitment to science and technology. 
We must use American ingenuity and know-how through this unique environment of the space station to tackle understanding of diseases or develop new techniques, like I just elaborated on a few minutes ago. Some will argue this type of research can be done more cost effectively on Earth. Other scientists will disagree because you cannot create a low gravity environment on Earth to perform many of these unique activities. 
One is microgravity research and providing better research in better pharmaceuticals, medical advancement to develop new materials to use on Earth, such as new fire resistant materials. My gosh, wouldn't our fighters have benefitted from that in Florida? 
Others might ask why this type of research cannot be done on the shuttle. The answer is we cannot rush the development of new technologies and science. If we did it on the shuttle, it means you would have 2 weeks maximum to be able to do it. I know no scientist working at my beloved NIH who could do research in 2 weeks, take a break, wait for another launch and go back for 2 weeks. 
One of the arguments we hear every year is space station-related costs and, sure, the space station does cost money, but the fact is that over $51 billion of the $96 billion discussed by Senator Bumpers is really related to shuttle missions, and those missions will fly whether we do the space station or not. 
One of the real questions, too, is what is the cost to the United States of America and its taxpayers if we do not continue or stay the course for the space station? We hear about the cost to maintain it and to build it. The actual work on the space station means 15,000 highly skilled engineering and production contract jobs supporting the space station. There are 35,000 contract workers and 5,000 civil servants who work on the shuttle, who is our major customer. This is a major employer. About 2,000 pounds of hardware have already been built for the U.S. station. 
What else do we lose? U.S. credibility with our international partners. Japan, Canada, and European Space Agency have all made this a truly international program. We have worked closely with the Russians. Like many, I am disappointed in the way the Russians have failed to deliver their promised technology on time, for which we paid. They have improved these actions, and I know President Clinton is moving on this. 
U.S. competitiveness can only be maintained by continuing the long-term, cutting-edge, high-risk research and development that we have done. I am not going to elaborate any further on what Senator John Glenn said. For all who are listening, we want to amplify that the space station is an important public investment and scientific breakthrough, where the very technology of doing the space station will lead to new breakthroughs in life science, information technology, and new kinds of materials--ceramic and so on--that will be very important to maintaining America's cutting edge. 
I reserve further time on my time for when we need to conclude our debate. 
I urge the defeat of the Bumpers amendment. Vote for the future and defeat the Bumpers amendment.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, and to all who are with us in the proceedings today, I rise with melancholy to pay tribute to a great Marylander who passed away over this weekend, our beloved and endeared comptroller, Louie Goldstein. Louie, indeed, was a Maryland treasure--and he was--to the State, and the State treasured him. Like all Marylanders, I will miss Louie Goldstein and mourn his passing. As Maryland's comptroller, he always stood steadfast sentry over the State purse. He helped make sure that the economy was booming, and he fought for the economy of our State. He fought for the State to have a triple-A bond rating. He also was out there absolutely on the side of his constituents. 
It is hard to believe that the State tax collector was the most popular elected official in the State. This man collected the State taxes for 40 years. And every tax season he would say `Don't delay. File today.' He crisscrossed the State often going close to 100,000 miles reaching out to rotaries, senior citizen clubs, and League of Women Voters gatherings always talking about the State's economy, what the tax dollars went for, and he was beloved. 
He ran a tight ship, and Maryland benefited from it for more than 39 years. In his 10 terms as the comptroller, he always made sure that Maryland kept its triple-A bond rating, which was an indication of our fiscal soundness. 
As the State's tax collector, he prided himself on getting tax returns back quickly and efficiently to Marylanders. There was no IRS-type heavy hand on Louie Goldstein's watch. 
We always knew that the tax collector's office was run efficiently, fairly, and a taxpayer could get a hearing and get their refund early and on time. 
Louie was a man of the old school. He was a gentleman. His word was his bond. He believed in high-tech and reach-out politics. But also he was a very shrewd businessman. Under his very folksy style in which he would reach out and always had a laugh and a word of encouragement, he also knew the power of high-tech. He came from an era of pen and paper. He would joke about himself, and was maybe even a stylist. But quickly he saw the power and utility of new technology and worked diligently to bring high-tech efficiency to the comptroller's office. 
Under his leadership, Maryland was the first State to computerize its tax records. At the time of his death, he was working on a system that would allow Marylanders to file their taxes electronically. 
He also realized the magnitude of the Year 2000 problem. He got a jump-start on fixing it. 
Imagine an 85-year-old comptroller who had served 10 terms doing the job, had more new ideas and was more farsighted than many of the young people who want to come into government. 
He was reshaping Maryland's computers so they would be ready by 1999. 
Now, anyone who met him knew there was much more to Louie Goldstein than his position as comptroller. When he came up to you, he would shake your hand, give you his trademark little imitation gold coin that said `God bless you, real good.' He radiated warmth that was truly genuine. Louie was a tremendous public speaker and, unlike most politicians, people looked forward to his southern Maryland accent. However, when other politicians found out he was scheduled to speak, they always got a little nervous, including yours truly. 
Louie Goldstein was a dedicated Democrat and worked tirelessly for a Democratic `Team Maryland,' but would work on a bipartisan basis for fiscal soundness and business attraction to the State. 
Early on, he campaigned for me. He knocked on doors, and he believed in me, when I was a little upstart politician before I got to be one of the fortunate 100. All Maryland Democrats owe Louie Goldstein a debt of gratitude for showing us how to stay in touch with constituents, whether it was at a church supper or in a business boardroom. 
Louie Goldstein was tremendously warm and kind. He loved to laugh and loved to be on the sunny side of life. I am proud to call him a friend, a colleague, and a mentor. There was and will be no one like him. We will find a successor, but we will never find a replacement, nor should we seek one. He was unique in Maryland politics, and I think he was unique in American history. 
On the day of his death, he was in five different parades, came home, read the Declaration of Independence to his gathered family, as he had done for so many years, took a swim, and then God called him to glory. 
We salute him. As Louie would say to one and all, I say to him, `Louie, God bless you, real good.'

Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, once again, we are on the floor to bring to the U.S. Senate for its consideration the appropriations on VA, HUD, and independent agencies. I thank Senator Bond for his very hard work and the bipartisan approach to producing this bill. 
I also acknowledge his professional staff and the collegial and cooperative way in which they have worked with my staff to bring this bill to the floor. It is this type of bipartisan effort that I think focuses on results, not rhetoric, meeting our obligations to important constituencies, like veterans and the elderly, and yet creating opportunities for people, like we are in FHA and VA mortgages, national service, and various other empowerment things we do. No one Member or party will get everything they want in this bill, but we do believe that this really does meet compelling human needs. Given the spartan allocation for the subcommittee and the need to make up cuts in programs, like housing for the elderly, I believe that this legislation is very solid. I strongly support it and encourage those on my side of the aisle to do so. 
This bill shows our commitment to both high touch and high tech. We have kept our high-touch commitment to our veterans and the elderly and the high-tech commitment to science in agencies like National Science Foundation, the space agency, and EPA. 
Let me talk a minute, though, just after the Fourth of July, about a constituency that truly does rely on the U.S. Senate for promises made, promises kept, and that is the veterans. The veterans of America rely on us, and I believe that Senator Bond and I have worked to scour every line item to be sure that the promises made to the veterans of the United States of America for their health care have been promises kept. 
This year, we will be funding veterans health care at the amount of $17.2 billion. That is `b' like in Barbara, not million, like `m' in Mikulski--$17.2 billion, and with the way we have been able to view the bill, this is a $200 million increase. 
Also, we want to improve VA medical research. The 
Veterans' Administration, through their excellent medical services, does an astounding amount of medical research, particularly the applied research that goes to hands-on clinical practice. In this budget, we have increased VA medical research by $38 million, to the tune of $310 million, and this will go to focus on research affecting aging populations, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, special needs of veterans, particularly those related to orthopaedic injury, surgical practice, and other improvements in clinical practice, to improve health care and shorten stays and not skimp. 
Also, as everyone here knows, as a champion of the women's health agenda, I wanted to be sure, working with Senator Bond, that we did not forget the men of this country. There is a special set-aside in here for research on prostate cancer, so that we can find a cure and we can find better early detection methods. We, the women of the Senate, as I know the Presiding Officer feels, want to show the men of America we are squarely on their side. 
I thank Senator Bond for going over this budget so that we could work to establish VA medical care, VA medical research, and also, at the same time, increase funding for something called veterans State homes. `State home' is an old-fashioned word. It comes out, really, of the Spanish-American War and out of World War I, where we had `old-age homes' for veterans. We are now at the end of the old century and moving to a new one, and State homes really now are long-term care and rehabilitation facilities for our veterans, but they are unique partnerships between the Federal Government and the State government, forming Federal-State partnerships to establish long-term care facilities, maximizing our dollars to operate it and even help build it, but State resources in purchases of land. This way, we stretch out the Federal dollar and the State becomes a stakeholder. I think this is a unique way of meeting the long-term care needs of our veterans population. 
While we were working to make sure promises made to the veterans were kept, we also, I think, had an excellent approach to the Housing and Urban Development Department. Particularly, I am impressed with the fact that we worked very hard, again, on a bipartisan basis in restoring the $489 million cut to elderly housing. HUD's elderly housing program is one of the more successful housing programs at the agency. It works with nonprofit organizations and faith-based organizations. The HUD 202 Program leverages those community resources that help provide safe and decent housing for the elderly and a sense of community in many communities around the country. 
The agency proposed close to a half-billion-dollar cut, and I am pleased that in the budget deliberation and now in our own appropriations, Senator Bond and I joined hands, joined forces, to make sure that we restored that cut so that the elderly of this country can have the 202 Program building housing for them and operating those programs. 
We also rejected with vigor the desire to take a substantial part of the housing for the elderly and convert that into vouchers. 
The Presiding Officer, I know, is on the Select Committee on Aging, and I know both in her home State of Maine and in her role in the Senate, she has been devoted to the cause of the elderly. She knows, as Senator Bond and I, that you cannot take an 80-year-old lady with a walker who is frail elderly and give her a voucher to go out in a community to find her own housing. 
Can you see her going up three flights of stairs with her voucher and her walker to see if the bathroom is fit for duty? We are not going to have the elderly of America going door-to-door with vouchers trying to find housing to meet their needs. That should be done through housing for the elderly, the 202 funding, housing for the elderly that is run primarily by nonprofit and faith-based organizations--Jewish charities and Catholic Charities in my own community. That is what the elderly want. 
Guess what? In this bill, we restored the $489 million, and I am really proud of the way we did that. 
In addition to looking out for the elderly, we wanted to look out for the young people of our community. 
We wanted to promote first-time home ownership. That is why we also looked at the FHA loan limit, recognizing that some parts of our country are very high cost. And we raised the FHA loan limit to $197,000 in high-cost areas and $108,000 in more modest areas. The administration proposed raising the limit to $227,000 for all communities. We believe that that is too high. 
We were deeply concerned about FHA foreclosures, that people would get into too much debt too early in their lives and end up not with an opportunity but with a heartbreak, and leaving the taxpayer with the liability. So we did not want heartbreak for the family and we did not want heartburn for the taxpayer. So we believe that this is a reasonable compromise, to raise it at this rate. It is critical that we ensure that FHA is able to meet the new market realities without setting ourselves up for this big buck unfunded liability in the event of FHA foreclosures. 
We also included language directing HUD to consult with Congress further before beginning its bulk sale of foreclosed properties. We do not want these houses to go at fire-sale prices or to end up adding blight to a community. We want to make sure that FHA is a tool for first-time home buyers, not a tool for neighborhood deterioration. 
We are also pleased that in this bill we really tackle the issue of brownfields. Brownfields funding is both in the HUD part of the bill as well as in the environmental protection part. The President requested $90 million for EPA's brownfields program. And $25 million of the request is provided for HUD's brownfields program. 
I happen to be a strong supporter of brownfields programs, and I think they are important tools to communities. They enable us to take care of areas that have a level of contamination and move them to clean up and redevelop them. My concern is that we will not get a Superfund authorization. And while we are waiting for Superfund funding--a great opportunity in our communities--brownfields that are not nearly as contaminated, with good gall and good appropriations, we can move brownfields to green fields, opening up opportunities for economic development. 
This then takes me to talking about EPA. Our bill provides critical resources for the Environmental Protection Agency at $7.4 billion. This is an increase of $51 million over last year. This is primarily in the areas of improving water quality, which are very important to a State like my own. It also includes last year's level of $1.5 billion for Superfund. 
This bill also contains money for State and tribal assistance grants, providing critical resources for States' efforts to maintain clean and healthy water. 
Madam President, water quality is absolutely crucial, and part of the funding is $20 million for the Chesapeake Bay program to continue our commitment to protect this natural resource. This Chesapeake Bay program was started by my predecessor, Senator Charles McC. Mathias, a distinguished Republican from the State of Maryland. Senator Sarbanes and I have kept that commitment. And we thank Presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and Bill Clinton, and now the Republican leadership of this committee, for working to keep that commitment going. 
We were also hit by something called an algae bloom. Now an algae bloom in my State is called pfiesteria. I understand that the Senator from Maine, the Presiding Officer, has also been hit by algae bloom in her own State. We know Senator Faircloth and Senator Helms have had it in North Carolina. We have had pfiesteria in Maryland; you have had problems in Maine; the Louisiana Senators have had it. 
This algae bloom is now a national problem, and we have put over $37 million in the EPA budget to begin to do the water quality monitoring and the research so that we can solve not only our problem in Maryland, but we also look forward to working with our colleagues, like yourself, in really dealing with this, because this could destroy our waters and it could destroy our mutual economies. Again, we look forward to working with you. This $37 million we think is a very important step in research and monitoring and trying to get good science and the best practices from EPA and environmental agencies in this. 
I regret that this year we do not have the authorization for the Superfund. Year after year, people want to reauthorize the Superfund site on appropriations and leave it to us to solve a problem that the authorizing cannot. I join in agreement with Senator Bond that we need the reauthorization of the Superfund site before we can move ahead on this bill. 
I know the administration is looking at additional sites for us to be able to clean up while we are waiting for authorization. I talked to Administrator Browner, and I said, if you have the sites, show us the money and get us also the authorization so that we can see how we could move forward. 
In the area of science and technology, I thank the chairman for working to increase both the funding of the national space agency as well as the National Science Foundation. In addition to increasing funding for the National Science Foundation, I am particularly pleased with the increases in informal education 
programs that will be important and also those in K through 12. 
Now, why is this important? Because so much of getting our young people excited about science goes on through informal education programs. These are not spontaneous playground programs; these are structured afterschool activities. 
In my own State, they are going on in the Maryland Science Center, the aquarium. I wish you had been with me during the break. I was at something called the Christopher Columbus Center, a marine biotech center. We have second graders there every day from 9 until 2. They do science in the morning; they do reading in the afternoon; and they are so excited. And when they go back then to the classroom, they are going to be much more reading ready and they are going to be excited about science. And, by the way, I got to do a few experiments myself. 
In terms of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA has been doing an outstanding job. I think FEMA has been doing an outstanding job, and we provided $1.3 billion to the agency, $500 million over the request. We also have provided a modest amount for predisaster mitigation, which I hope, as the bill moves forward through conference, we can actually increase because of the approach to preventing disasters. 
In my own State, Allegheny County has gotten a $700,000 grant, and we have worked with the Corps of Engineers and the Governor. We are well on our way to protecting communities that normally are hit. 
Now, in this legislation also there is $9 million for FEMA to have resources to do the training necessary to prevent us from terrorist attacks due to weapons of mass destruction. Senator Bond and I are working to increase that funding. I know it started out even more spartan than this. But, Madam President, we really have to worry that the predators in the world--be they nations or terrorists--are really going to once again try to spread weapons of mass destruction on the United States of America. I know that the military is standing sentry, our intelligence agencies will give us the warning, but we need to look out for our civilian population. I think we need to have the type of training at the local level that we can be able to move in this bill. 
Let me also thank the chairman for including money for national service, which does provide the opportunity for so many people to volunteer in our own communities, at the rate of $425 million, last year's request. 
And let me close by saying there are two independent agencies--the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, which we funded at $60 million, that I think specific amounts of money are absolutely out there in poor communities and near-poor communities doing a good job. Also, our Consumer Product Safety Commission has gotten out of the rhetoric business under its able administrator Ms. Brown and really is giving much needed advice on consumer product safety. Most recently, she has been helping with the whole issue of a particular type of blanket which could cause the death of preschoolers. 
This is our bill. It goes from funding Arlington Cemetery and the Consumer Product Safety Agency, to protecting us against national disasters, to honoring our commitment to veterans, to protecting the environment, and promoting science. This is one of the most interesting and exciting bills and subcommittees in the U.S. Senate. I believe the chairman and I have done an outstanding job in trying to get real value for the taxpayer and for the Nation in this bill. I hope that this bill moves forward and that our arguments have been so compelling that there won't be any amendments and we can pass this bill by tomorrow afternoon. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to echo the request of Senator Bond. I say to all my Democratic colleagues, if you have an amendment, please let us know by noon tomorrow, preferably even by 10 o'clock tomorrow morning so we could have discussions with you and perhaps find other ways to resolve their, I am sure, very legitimate concerns. 
Also, we ask our colleagues to cooperate with us in a time agreement. There are many bills waiting to come to the floor. We have very few days left in July. We are ready to move our bill. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am pleased to join with Chairman Bond in offering this FEMA amendment. As he has indicated, it provides an additional $8 million for the antiterrorist activities of FEMA, combined with a $3 million increase provided in the full committee markup. 
Now, this is really important. There are rogues, bums, and predators out there who want to destroy the United States of America. The United States of America can be attacked and it can be attacked by another nation by a weapon of mass destruction, or it can be attacked by an external terrorist, or even someone within our own country. 
What are weapons of mass destruction? They are, of course, nuclear weapons. They are, in addition to nuclear, chemical, biological, and even cybermanipulation. 
The issues around chemical and biological weapons present new and unique threats to the United States of America. I am fortunate to have two outstanding military installations in my State, Fort Detrick as well as Aberdeen, whose whole approach is to look into the research activities on what could be the possible weapons used against us, whether it be nerve gas or a despicable virus that could bring a city's population to its knees. 
We were concerned in our hearing and raised this issue. Mr. James Lee Witt, the head of FEMA, said he did need to have more resources. In President Clinton's speech at the U.S. Naval Academy, he said that he had directed the administration to undertake a concerted effort to protect our people in the event of biological or chemical weapons being unleashed either by a rogue state, an international criminal organization, or a terrorist group. The key elements of this directive are, for the first time, a civilian stockpile of antidotes and antibiotics, protecting the population by public health surveillance to detect biological or chemical agents, and analyzing the results of diseases. 
The President wants an additional $294 million to go to the Justice Department, the FBI, the Department of Health and Human Services, but certainly to FEMA. 
We support the FEMA request because it is very important. It is consistent with its overall mission. They receive tasking under the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici legislation that it protect us from all hazards, including weapons of mass destruction, and they need to do several things: They need to play an important role in coordination, and they need to do preparedness by working with States for planning and for training. 
It is not only planning--we are not talking about endless summers of planning--but actual exercises to prepare local agencies, from city fire departments to police departments to emergency medical personnel, on what will be the way to both contain the attack and contain the panic around the attack. If we are hit by something from a rogue state or from an international criminal organization, one of the first instances will be to contain the chemical attack or identify the biological one. But people will be scared, they will be panic-stricken. This is an unknown situation. It is FEMA's job to work with the civilian population around the preparedness to do this. 
We know that our colleagues in the Department of Defense, like at Fort Detrick, we know that the National Institutes of Health and FDA will be working on the antidotes and the vaccines to protect our civilian population. 
We believe that this amount of $17 million enhances the preparedness, which is to coordinate with the Department of Defense and the National Guard, with the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as State and local governments. 
DOD, except through the National Guard, doesn't have a relationship with State and local governments. They come in after the first responders. So these funds are very important in developing a new manual, in developing training in the State and local communities, particularly in the high-risk areas that we know would be targeted by rogue states, to deal with their predatory acts. 
We believe that this legislation will provide them with a downpayment to prepare. We have been so focused on moving FEMA from a cold-war agency to responding to the tremendous number of civilian natural disasters we have had, and they have done an outstanding job. We now have the infrastructure for them to respond to any risk that the United States of America faces. Now when the ugly head of someone like Saddam Hussein is raised or the ugly tentacles of international crime organizations try to do their predatory acts, we need to stand sentry with our military and our intelligence agencies. 
But for anyone who is thinking about doing harm in any way to the American people, know we are well on our way to being prepared. We are prepared now, so don't think, if you are listening out there on CNN, where Saddam Hussein is, don't think we are not prepared. We are prepared, but we are even going to be better prepared. So don't even think about doing it, because if you do, you will face us in return and know we will take any and all means possible to protect our people and we, the Federal emergency management appropriators, are ready to make sure they have the resources to begin the planning and the drills to protect our people. 
I support this amendment, and if there is no objection, I urge adoption of the amendment.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I think this is an outstanding managers' amendment. I think it resolves several issues related to the Tuscaloosa Hospital, the American Battle Monuments Commission, as well as clarifying certain things with EPA. 
I am particularly gratified that we will recognize the differences of the environmental effects between animal fats and vegetable oils and petroleum oil. And I think this will be an important clarification for EPA to issue this commonsense differentiation. I have been at oil spills and I have also spilled some oil on my floor cooking those Maryland crab cakes, and I know the difference, and it will help EPA know as well. 
So I am prepared to accept the amendment.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by Senators Murray and Snowe. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. 
This amendment states Senate support for providing access to reproductive services for military women overseas. It repeals the current ban on privately funded abortions at US military facilities overseas. 
I strongly support this amendment for four reasons. First of all, safe and legal access to abortion is the law. Secondly, women serving overseas should have a full range of medical services. Thirdly, this amendment protects the health and well-being of military women. Finally, we should not deprive military women from legal medical procedures. 
It is a matter of simple fairness that our servicewomen, as well as the spouses and dependents of servicemen, be able to exercise their right to make health care decisions when they are stationed abroad. Women who are stationed overseas are totally dependent on their base hospitals for medical care and should not be denied abortion services when confronted with an unintended pregnancy. Most of the time the only access to safe, quality medical care is in a military facility. We should not discriminate against female military personnel just because they are stationed overseas. They should be able exercise the same freedoms they enjoy at home. Without this amendment, military women will continue to be treated like second-class citizens. 
It is ridiculous to think that a woman cannot use her own funds to pay for access to safe and quality medical care. 
The current ban on access to reproductive services is yet another hit on Roe v. Wade. It is an attempt to cut away at the constitutionally protected right of women to choose. It strips military women of the very rights they were recruited to protect. Abortion is a fundamental right for the women in this country. It has been upheld repeatedly by the Supreme Court. 
Let's be very clear on what we are talking about here today. We are talking about the right of women to obtain a safe and legal abortion paid for with their own funds. We are not talking about using any taxpayer or federal money. We are not talking about reversing the conscience clause. No military personnel will be compelled to perform an abortion against their wishes. 
This is an issue of fairness to the women who sacrifice every day to serve our nation. They deserve the same quality care that women in America have access to each day. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment to the 1999 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senators Glenn and Sarbanes. 
I am pleased that this amendment has been accepted by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee, and I thank Senator Thurmond, Senator Levin and Senator Warner for their assistance. 
The amendment I am introducing today seeks to change the way we dispose of unneeded Navy ships. 
Our great Navy ships served valiantly--and they should be retired with honor. 
Instead, men die as they break these ships. Others are maimed forever, Our waterways become terribly polluted. Then, when they're done, we're left with torn hunks of metal--polluting our ports--and requiring huge sums of money to clean-up. 
With the end of the cold war the number of ships to be disposed of in the military arsenal is growing. There are 180 Navy and Maritime Administration ships waiting to be scrapped. These ships are difficult and dangerous to dismantle. They usually contain asbestos, PCB's and lead paint. They were built long before we understood all the environmental hazards associated with these materials. 
This issue was brought to my attention by a Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles that appeared in the Baltimore Sun written by reporters Gary Cohn and Will Englund. 
They conducted a thorough and rigorous investigation of the way we dispose of our Navy and maritime ships. They traveled around the country and around the world to see firsthand how our ships are dismantled, and Mr. President, I must advise that the way we do this is not being done in an honorable, environmentally sensitive, or efficient way. 
I believe when we have ships that have defended the United States of America, that they were floating military bases--and they should be retired with the same care and dignity with which we close a military base. 
Let me read from the Sun series: 
As the Navy sells off warships at the end of the Cold War, a little known industry has grown up. In America's depressed ports and where the ship breaking industry goes, pollution and injured workers are left in its wake. 
The Pentagon repeatedly deals with ship breakers with dismal records, then fails to keep watch as they leave health, environmental and legal problems in their wake. 
Of the 58 ships sold for scrapping since 1991, only 28 have been finished. And oh, my God, how they have been finished. I would like to turn to my own hometown of Baltimore. 
Workers in Baltimore spoke about toiling in air thick with asbestos. Laborers scrapped the U.S. Coral Sea, ripping asbestos insulation from an aircraft carrier with their bare hands. At times they had no respirators, standard equipment for asbestos workers. As we all know inhaling those fibers can have lethal consequences. 
Workers were ordered to stuff asbestos into a leaky barge to hide it from inspectors. Dangerous substances from scrapped shipyards have polluted harbors, rivers and shorelines, the Sun paper goes on to say. 
This is what the Coral Sea looked like while it was being dismantled in the Baltimore harbor. It looks like it was ravaged. Like it was cannibalized. 
The Coral Sea's dismantling had been marked by several fires. Dumping oil in the harbor. Lawsuits and repeated delays. The mishandling of asbestos. The Navy inspector refused to board the Coral Sea because he was afraid it was too dangerous. 
I am quoting now the Sun paper. `September 16, 1993, the military sent its lone inspector for the United States to the salvage yard in Baltimore. He didn't inspect it because he thought it was too dangerous.' 
The inspector was right to be concerned about his own safety. The next day a 23-year-old worker found out how safe it would be. 
He walked on a flight deck and he dropped 30 feet from the hangar. `I felt the burning feeling inside,' he said, `blood was coming out of my mouth, I didn't think I would live. He suffered a fractured spleen, pelvis, and broke his arms in several places. 
At the same time we had repeated fires that were breaking out. In November of 1996, a fire broke out in the Coral Sea's engine room. No one was standing fire watch. No hose nearby. The blaze burned quickly out of control and for the sixth time Baltimore City's fire department had to come in and rescue a shipyard. At the same time the owner of the shipyard had a record of environmental violations--a record for which he ultimately was sentenced to jail. 
All this was happening right in Baltimore Harbor. You've probably passed it if you've taken the Baltimore Harbor tour. It is right across from Fort McHenry--where we defended the United States of America and won the second battle for the War of 1812. And look at it--that's what it looks like--it is a national disgrace that was in the Harbor as well as a national environmental danger. 
It wasn't limited to Baltimore. In Terminal Island, California, workers were fired when they told federal investigators how asbestos was being improperly stripped from Navy ships. 
A scrap yard from the southeast, Cape Fear, North Carolina, was so contaminated with asbestos, oil, and lead, that David Heater, an assistant attorney general, said the site looked like one of the levels of Dante's hell. Now ship scrappers frustrate regulators by constructing a maze of corporate names and moving frequently. 
Meanwhile, right down the road from the Coral Sea in Baltimore was the Baltimore city shipyard, the Bethlehem steel shipyard that was foraging for work. We were desperate for work in our shipyard. Desperate. But no, do you think the Navy turned to shipyards like Bethlehem Ship? 
While all of this has been going on, the Navy also planned to send our ships overseas--where worker and environmental safety are virtually ignored. 
In India, the Sun paper found a tidal beach where 35,000 men scrapped the world ships with little more than their bare hands. They worked under wretched conditions. 
This is the United States Navy ships being dismantled in India. Thirty-five thousand people work on a beach, often with no shoes, dismantling ships with their bare hands. This is an international disgrace. 
I introduced a bill to change the way we dispose of unneeded Navy ships. This bill had two parts. The first would ban the export of ships to countries that don't care about protecting workers or the environment. The second part would create a pilot program to use American shipyards to break ships. Because while fly-by-night companies were attempting to break ships, we had American shipyards foraging for work--both in Baltimore and around the country. 
The amendment I'm introducing today includes only the second part of my legislation. This amendment will create a pilot program to enable the Navy to develop new, efficient ways of breaking ships that meet environmental and occupational safety standards. 
The Navy raised legitimate concerns about my original bill. My bill focused on competence. I wanted shipyards to break ships--because I believe that our shipyards have the experience and facilities to break ships safely. Shipyards, like the ones in my hometown of Baltimore, that are fit for duty. They know how to build a ship, they know how to convert a ship, they know how to dismantle a ship. 
But the Navy was concerned that this would limit competition. So I changed my amendment to insure full and open competition. Any competent company can apply to participate in the pilot program. 
What do I mean by `competent?' I mean that whoever breaks ships must have a record of protecting their workers' safety and the environment. They must have technical skills, a safe workplace, and a record of complying with environmental laws. 
So my amendment addresses competency--as well as competition. It will make sure that ships are broken in a way that protects workers, the environment, and the American taxpayer. 
This amendment will enable the Navy to do a better job of disposing of unneeded ships. My legislation will give the Navy the will and resources to retire our ships with honor. 
I knew when the Senate saw these pictures they would be as taken aback as I have. I would like to thank the Sun paper for their outstanding series in bringing this not only to my attention but to America's attention. 
They won the Pulitzer prize. But I want the United States of America to be sure that we win a victory here today for workers, the environment--and especially for the Navy. Because I know our Navy wants to do the right, honorable thing. 
Again, I thank Senator Thurmond, Senator Levin, and Senator Warner for their support of my amendment.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. president, I rise today to congratulate the University of Maryland women's lacrosse team on winning their fourth consecutive national championship by beating the number one-ranked University of Virginia, 11-5. Simply put, this is unprecedented in the history of women's lacrosse. The Maryland women's lacrosse team is the only team in NCAA Division I history to accomplish this remarkable feat. As the Senator for Maryland, I couldn't be more proud. 
Because lacrosse is the unofficial state sport of Maryland, the Terrapins' championship is especially sweet for people in my home state. You see, in Maryland, we love our lacrosse, and it seems like the Maryland women's lacrosse team always comes through for us. This year, Maryland made its 15th ninth consecutive NCAA Final Four appearance, advanced to the championship game for the fifth consecutive year, played its record-setting 29th tournament game, won its record-setting 21st tournament game, won its fifth national championship in the last seven years, and won its record-setting 21st tournament game, won its fifth national championship in the last seven years, and won its seventh national championship overall. 
Five Terps were named to the NCAA All-Tournament team, including College Lacrosse USA Division I Woman Player of the Year Sascha Newmarch, Kathleen Lund, Alex Kahoe, Tonia Porras, and Cathy Nelson, who was honored as the tournament MVP. The Terps were led by head coach Cindy Timchal, who has a 203-51 career record and is the third-winningest coach in women's lacrosse history. Too often, women's sports go unnoticed. However, every single member of this fabulous team deserves to be recognized--not only for their championship, but for exemplifying what college athletics are all about. 
Mr. President, I'm sure you can see why Maryland is so proud of its Terrapins. Like so many lacrosse fans in my home state, I can't wait until next season.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life of Mabel Virginia Jews, a dedicated mother and a great educator who passed away on May 23, 1998. As we work to strengthen our Nation's families, I hope we can all find inspiration in the life of this remarkable woman. 
In 1934, Mrs. Jews graduated from then Morgan State College and followed her undergraduate studies with a Masters degree from the former Salisbury State College in the 1960's. She lived most of her life on Maryland's Eastern Shore where she dedicated herself to education, both in her classrooms and in the life of her son, William Jews, Jr. As a teacher, Mrs. Jews taught English and home economics in junior high and high school where her patience and kindness taught students to feel comfortable about learning. In addition to her service as a schoolteacher, Mrs. Jews also worked as hospital administrator, Pentagon employee and property manager. 
Mabel Jews believed in getting behind our kids, making her son and his education her top priority. Mrs. Jews focused her life's work on helping young Bill build an educational record that would give him the opportunity to attend any school in the country. I'm pleased to say he chose Maryland's Johns Hopkins University. As many of my colleagues know, Bill Jews is now the president of CareFirst Inc. and chief executive officer of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Maryland. We can imagine how proud Mrs. Jews was of her son's success. She was a model mother who espoused the values we work to promote in our country's families. 
Mr. President, I am honored today to pay special tribute to such an inspirational and important Marylander. Throughout her lifetime, Mabel Jews made vital contributions to the successful life of her son Bill, as well as to the lives and lessons of those who surrounded her. The great state of Maryland is fortunate to have been home to such a great woman.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I joined former First Lady Betty Ford, former HEW Secretary Joe Califano, and Congresswoman Nancy Johnson to release the first national, comprehensive study of the abuse of alcohol, cigarettes, and psychoactive prescription drugs by women over age 59. The study found that in 1998, substance abuse by mature women will trigger more than $30 billion in health costs--$10.1 billion in inpatient hospital bills, $12.2 billion in nursing home bills, and $7.7 billion for physician services and home health care. 
I would like to pay a special tribute to Mrs. Ford. Her courage and her gallantry has given hope to others who have faced similar if not identical problems. By speaking out and by facing her own problems with the love and support of her family, she gave those who have less power, or maybe less love, the strength to do what she did. Mrs. Ford, Liz Taylor, Ann Richards, I think we really owe a debt of gratitude to them, and we owe a debt to every well-known woman in our society who has been willing to step forward, speak up and speak out about the dangers of older women and substance abuse. 
I'd also like to pay tribute to President Ford for the courage to organize a family intervention. Thank you for showing us that when a man really loves a woman, sometimes you need tough love. If Mrs. Ford had had a heart attack, Mr. Ford would have been the first one there with CPR. His intervention was the CPR of substance abuse. 
Today's findings address a problem hidden in the shadow for too long. Mature women who struggle with depression and loneliness and fight them with drugs and alcohol today know they are not alone. This study shines the bright light of research and knowledge to take this problem out of the shadows. 
It is the first step to help mature women get help from doctors, from family, and from friends. It is the first step to help grown men and women identify the warning signs of addiction, not just with their own kids, but with their parents. It is startling and troubling that mature women are more likely to be hospitalized for substance abuse than for heart attacks. 
In Maryland in 1996, 285 mature women sought help for substance abuse in certified treatment centers, 230 in 1997. Thousands more are too scared, too sick, or too alone to seek out care they need. This study can help them. And it can help America. 
I have been a life-long fighter for mature Americans. I believe `honor your mother and father' is not just a good commandment, it's good public policy. That's why I am such a big supporter of research like today's study. This study not only highlights a big problem, it highlights opportunities to make good public policy. 
If we can end substance abuse among the elderly, we can lower financial costs for Medicaid and Medicare. More importantly, we can lower the emotional cost to women and families. We can't let a blanket of shame and denial blind us to problems that we can and should solve. 
I support more research to help protect seniors from scams, from poverty, and from threats to their health. I send thanks to Bristol-Myers Squibb and to the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse for revealing this troubling problem and helping to create solutions. 
Today's research, which focuses on women and seniors, is one big reason I am a big supporter of NIH. Women's health has made great headway with NIH. In 1990, Congresswomen Connie Morella, Pat Schroeder and I showed up on the steps at NIH to launch what we hoped would be a women's health initiative. Through our efforts, the Office of Women's Health Research was established so that women would no longer be left out of clinical trials and research protocols. I am pleased that we are now seeing more and better research on women's health. 
I am sending this report to Dr. Varmus, Director of NIH with my endorsement and with my request that NIH expand its research on alcohol and drug abuse by mature women. Today's study is a shining example of what can get done with attention and money and more women in the House and Senate. 
I would ask all my colleagues, men and women, Democrat and Republican, House and Senate, to read the executive summary of `Under the Rug: Substance Abuse and the Mature Woman', which I will send to them. We shouldn't play politics with women's lives, and we shouldn't play politics with the lives of the mature women and their families who are trying to cope with the terrible problems of substance abuse.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a remarkable naval officer and good friend, Admiral Charles R. Larson. Having served a distinguished career in the United States Navy, Admiral Larson will enjoy a well deserved retirement after forty years of service. Over his forty years of service, Admiral Larson has served in 11 positions, spanning more than nineteen years as a flag officer. Admiral Larson is a man of honor, integrity, and patriotism. 
For the past four years, Admiral Larson has served as the 55th Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy. It was in this position that I got to know and admire him. Under Admiral Larson's leadership, honor and discipline were restored following the most scandal-ridden period of the Academy's history. As a member of the Naval Academy Board of Visitors, I worked closely with Admiral Larson as he developed and implemented his successful reform agenda. I was highly impressed with the tough choices he had to make to change the Academy. Under his leadership, he led the full integration of women into the academy. He also initiated many new programs and improved the curriculum. Always he led the midshipmen by example. 
We in Maryland are very proud of the United States Naval Academy. It is important to our state and our nation. The Board of Visitors recently conducted a comprehensive investigation of the Naval Academy. We concluded that while we must continue to improve the Naval Academy, this vital national resource is on the right track and will produce top-notch cadets for the twenty-first Century. Admiral Larson's leadership is what made this possible. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to commend Admiral Larson's wife, Sally, and his family, who have greatly contributed to the success of his naval career. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Admiral Larson for his service to our nation. I wish Admiral Larson the very best for the future.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report accompanying the re-authorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. While I support this legislation, I am disappointed that veterans programs were used to pay for a portion of this bill. Nonetheless, this bill contains significant increases in funding for Maryland's highway and transit programs. I am proud to have worked with my colleague Senator Sarbanes to make sure Maryland got its fair share of funds for its transportation needs. 
With billions in needed maintenance and construction in the State of Maryland, this legislation will make our highways safer and expand transit options for our citizens. It will help to ease the flow of traffic on our major highways and byways and begin the long awaited re-construction of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. 
This bill provides $900 million for a new Wilson Bridge, $500 million more than the Administration proposed last year. Although this does not represent the total cost of a new bridge, it is a first step toward replacement of the bridge. Let me make it clear, I do not consider this funding to be the end. I consider this to be the beginning. In future years, I will continue the effort to secure additional funding to complete the re-building of Wilson Bridge, a critical link on the I-95 system and the only federally owned bridge in the system. 
Under this bill, Maryland will receive more money for its highway program than it gets now. Maryland can expect approximately $400 million per year for its highway program--almost $90 million more than it gets now. This is almost a 30 percent increase in funding that will help improve the conditions of our highway system--which is one of the most congested in the nation. The Washington area has the second longest commute time in the nation. The funds authorized in this bill should help provide some much needed relief. 
The bill not only provides more funds for Maryland's overall highway program, it specifically targets funds for high priority projects around the State. The bill provides $26 million to upgrade Route 113 in Worcester County, one of the most dangerous highways in the State of Maryland. Every time I visit the Eastern Shore, I am always reminded about the need to upgrade this highway. Too many Marylanders have lost their lives on this stretch of roadway. This legislation will fund the first and most critical phase of this project to make the road safer for those who use it. 
Another major project that has desperately needed funds has been the I-70/I-270 interchange in Frederick. It is one of the only interchanges on the interstate system that does not meet interstate standards. It has been a safety hazard for years. The lack of an adequate interchange in the area has forced trucks off the interstate and into surrounding areas. This legislation will provide funding to complete the first phase of reconstruction and relieve the local community of this burden, while improving the safety of this section of highway. 
For the first time, almost $10 million will be earmarked for Route 32 in Anne Arundel County in the vicinity of the National Security Agency. This highway is one of the most heavily traveled highways in the State and needs to expand capacity to accommodate the growth in the surrounding area. 
This legislation will also increase funding for the Appalachian Highway System. Maryland can expect to receive approximately $6 million per year for the next six years under this bill--that is enough to rebuild U.S. 220 in Allegany County. This is the number one highway priority for Western Maryland and a serious safety problem. This is $4 million per year more than Maryland receives now. Thanks to this legislation, Maryland will have the funds to upgrade this highway. 
Mr. President, not only does Maryland receive more highway dollars, we receive more transit dollars. Maryland will receive almost twice as much federal funds for its transit programs. The MARC system will receive an additional $185 million and the Baltimore Light Rail System will receive $125 million to double-track the system. This will continue to expand transit opportunities for Marylanders and help relieve congestion on our highways. 
Mr. President, I do have one major reservation to this conference report. I believe it is just plain wrong that our veterans are being asked to sacrifice their compensation for our transportation needs. I made my feelings very clear when I voted in favor of an amendment to the Budget Resolution earlier this year that called on the Congress to protect veterans benefits. As the Ranking Member of the Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, I will look for way to ensure that these funds are replenished. Our vets, our heroes, deserve better and I will fight to correct this deep injustice. 
Despite my anger over the veterans offset, I will support this legislation because it is so important to improving the safety of Maryland's highways, byways and transit systems. Improving public safety and creating jobs are two of my highest priorities and this bill addresses both.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I am cosponsoring with Senator Rockefeller, the DVA Primary Care Incentive Act of 1998. 
Mr. President, I believe that this bill will ultimately benefit our veterans. It will help the Department of Veterans Affairs in its effort to provide the highest quality of care that our veterans deserve. 
Mr. President, this bill will create a new Education Debt Reduction program, and an Employee Incentive Scholarship Program. The Debt Reduction Program will aid the VA in its efforts to increase its number of primary care professionals. Preference will be given to those choosing to serve at rural or under-served sites, and to those professionals in hard to fill specialties. The bill provides the Secretary of the VA with the discretion to determine priority needs with respect to profession, and locations with the greatest need. Debt Reduction program recipients will have to serve a term with the VA equivalent to the length of the repayments. A key component of the Debt Reduction Program is that each years repayments won't begin until a person has completed a corresponding year of service to the VA. This requirement is critical to ensuring that our veterans get the service they deserve, and that taxpayers get a return on their tax dollars invested. 
Mr. President, I introduced a debt reduction bill in 1992 because I recognized the need to provide the VA with adequate resources to recruit the professionals it needs. And I realized that some who may want to get the training to help our veterans may not have all of the necessary means to do so. I applaud Senator Rockefeller for including an updated debt reduction component to this bill. 
The second component of the bill is the Employee Incentive Scholarship Program. This is designed to help meet the VA's need for more primary care professionals and to help retain and retrain some of the VA's current employees. Like the Debt Reduction program, priority would be given to those willing to serve in under-served areas and in hard to fill specialties. Recipients would also have to serve at a VA clinical site for a term equivalent to the scholarship term. The difference is that the Scholarship program would be open only to current VA employees with a minimum of two years of service. We want to ensure that those benefiting from the Scholarship program have demonstrated a commitment to the VA. We also want to provide the opportunity structure for those employees who want to expand their skills and move into new fields. 
In 1996, Veterans Health Administration Under Secretary for Health, Dr. Kenneth Kizer, published a work called `Prescription for Change'. In it, he noted the VA's goal to increase the number of VA non-physician primary care providers by 200 percent by 1998. While the VA has made progress, it has not met its goal. This bill seeks to provide another tool in the VA's tool belt that will allow it to meet its goal. 
Mr. President, I have been an advocate for our nation's veterans for years. I firmly believe that promises made to our nations veterans must be promises kept. Our veterans risked their lives for our freedom and the protection of democracy. I believe that we as a nation are committed to providing the services that our veterans need. 
As the VA continues its move to more outpatient primary care, we must make sure that the VA can attract and retain the type of professionals who can give our veterans the medical care and treatment they deserve. 
I urge my colleagues' support.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President: I rise in strong support of the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. 
This legislation is very simple. It says you can have normal economic and political relations with the United States--or you can join America's enemies in building weapons of mass destruction. You cannot do both. 
This bill applies sanctions to organizations that transfer missile hardware or technology to Iran. It would ban U.S. economic assistance and the export of technology to anyone who is helping Iran develop the means of using weapons of mass destruction. 
Iran has a robust chemical and biological weapons program. As we debate this legislation, Iran is building the Shihab 3 missile. This ballistic missile could carry conventional, biological or chemical weapons to Israel, to the Gulf states or to American interests within 800 miles of Iran. 
Imagine these weapons in the hands of a country that is our sworn enemy. A country that supports the most radical, anti-American terrorist organizations on earth. A country that does everything it can to derail the Middle East peace process. 
These missiles could destroy Tel Aviv. They could reach our NATO allies. They could threaten the thousands of American troops in the Gulf. 
Russia has played a central role in helping Iran to develop these weapons. Despite past assurances, Russian scientists and engineers are using their skills to threaten America's national security. 
The United States has done a lot to help Russia build a prosperous democracy. Since 1991, we have given Russia over four billion dollars in assistance. We have done a great deal to build a cooperative partnership with Russia. 
As the ranking member of the VA-HUD subcommittee that funds the space program, I have been a strong supporter of US-Russian cooperation with the space station. 
I supported Russia's participation in the space program for three reasons: 
1. Their technical expertise 
2. To build stronger links between the United States and Russia 
3. To ensure that Russian scientists and engineers had civilian work--so they would not sell their skills to rogue governments 
Russia has failed to live up to their promises on the space station. I have no question of their technical competence. But I have strong concerns about their failure to meet their end of the bargain. They have not adequately funded their share of the space station, resulting in delays and a cloud of uncertainty that hovers over the entire program. 
Even more troubling is Russia's role in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Russia has exported technology, material and expertise to help Iran develop ballistic missiles. They can't do this--and expect to have business as usual with America on the space program. 
Mr. President; our foreign policy must reflect our values. We cannot stand by while any country threatens our national security, or the very existence of our closest allies. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today as an original co-sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act II. I commend Senator Biden for his hard work on this continuing effort to combat violence against women. I believe we are making great progress as a nation to make our streets and our world safer by cracking down on violent crime. This new law represents the continuing Federal effort to deal with these crucial issues. I am encouraged by the bipartisan support for this bill. Protecting the lives of women and children should not be a partisan issue. Both Democrat and Republican members of the United States Senate are taking a solid stand against the disgraceful and cowardly crime of domestic violence. 
Mr. President, I strongly support this important legislation for three reasons. First, this bill continues the fight for a safer world by providing new and continuing grants to improve the criminal justice system's protections for women and children. Second, it provides important training for those involved in the response to citizens abused by domestic violence. Third it expands and strengthens the services available to victims of violence. 
The Violence Against Women Act II is a big step forward in the effort to keep women, children and communities safe. One of the most critical components of this bill is the reauthorization of the STOP Grant funds for vital programs in our states. This allows the states to obtain the money they need to create and mobilize effective strategies against violence. In my state of Maryland, the Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General of Maryland created the Family Violence Council to find ways to reduce and prevent family violence. With the STOP Grant funds Maryland received through the 1994 Violence Against Crime Act, the Council has been able to effectively assist a statewide initiative against crime. This money has been used to help Maryland develop policies and procedures against domestic violence. It has been used to ensure the development of the best possible laws to protect victims and hold abusers accountable. We have coordinated community programs that protect victims. We have made efforts to break the cycle of violence between generations. And we have stood together as citizens of Maryland and said that violence against women is something we cannot and will not tolerate. 
Second, this legislation provides the authorization for money to train people to respond to domestic abuse. It amends the STOP and Pro-Arrest grants and makes states and local courts specifically eligible for funding. These are the same programs that brought police and prosecutors into the loop of personnel who combat violence toward women. The bill we are introducing today takes the next vital step. It expressly targets funds to the courts and helps engage them in the fight against domestic violence. By educating judicial staff and officers of the court about the special issues raised by violence against women, we completed the circle of people who must work in partnerships to end these crimes. Judges and officers are often the first people a victim will meet in the criminal system when seeking legal intervention. The judicial staff are the ones who can set the stage for whether or not a victim will proceed with her claim. This legislation ensures that all personnel in the criminal justice system are educated and trained to handle cases of domestic violence. This ensures that the proper support, services and protection are available to those who need it most. 
Finally, I support this bill because of the services it provides for the victims of these destructive crimes. In 1992, we witnessed a national travesty. In 1992 the National Domestic Violence Hotline went out of business. Not because there was no domestic violence. At that time, the hotline averaged 7.5 calls an hour, 180 calls a day and 65,520 calls a year. The hotline went out of business because it had no funding. That means lives were lost because our citizens had an emergency hotline number that no longer worked. That means more children were beaten and murdered every day who might have been able to get the help they needed. That means the federal government was not meeting its duty to stop the deadly cycle of violent crime. 
We cannot and must not allow this to happen again. That is why in 1994 we included a new provision in the law to authorize grants to revive the national hotline. That is why today we are now increasing and extending authorizations to meet the growing demands on the Hotline. Today any woman or child with access to a telephone can dial 1-800-799-SAFE and get the help they urgently need from a qualified and informed professional. 
Domestic violence in this country was ignored for far too long before we passed the first Violence Against Women Act. Annually, at least 2 million children and 2 to 4 million women are abused by the people closest to them. These statistics truly send home a very strong message: The most vulnerable members of our society have historically not been served by our government. These alarming crime rates resound loudly and should be heard by every legislator elected to Congress. 
We must remain keenly aware of the fact that four women a day are killed at the hands of their batterer. That fifty-seven percent of children under 12 who are murdered are killed by a parent. That every fifteen seconds a woman is beaten by her husband or boyfriend. The Violence Against Women Act II will continue the effort to combat this violence toward women. The time is now to act and to continue our fight. No woman should live in fear that any person will get away with hurting her or her children. I have stated in the past that if you intend to harm a woman that you better stay out of my state of Maryland. I strongly encourage every single member of the Senate to not only vote for, but to actively support this crucial legislation.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act. I supported the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act for three reasons: to stop the bounty hunters, to put the person who had lost the most money in charge of class action suits, and to penalize people who commit fraud. 
I have been very disturbed and disappointed to hear from many Maryland biotechnology and high technology companies that the 1995 reforms are being circumvented and, that in some respects, nothing has changed. 
Why has nothing changed even though we enacted those important reforms? Because some have refused to accept the law of the land. Rather than abide by congressional efforts to protect small companies that create jobs and help to maintain our robust economy, a small group of specialized lawyers have simply shifted their filings to state courts. 
Enacting this uniform standards legislation would close this loophole and enable Congress to finish the job of eliminating abusive securities litigation that hampers and harms our economic future 
Uniform standards would only involve class action suits with at least 50 plaintiffs involving nationally traded securities. These claims were rarely filed in state courts until federal reform became law in December 1995. 
This exposure of national companies and their shareholders to lawsuits by 50 different sets of rules amounts to a balkanization of securities law that boosts legal fees, distracts companies from creating jobs, and erodes the value of shareholder investments. 
I have heard from Maryland CPAs, venture capitalists, and Maryland companies along the I-270 High-Tech Highway that these uniform standards are needed. 
I believe that much of our economic future is in new and developing industries such as high technology and bio-technology. New, high-tech jobs are created only when companies generate capital to allow them to move into new fields. Without a balanced and uniform legal system free of loopholes, these companies must spend too much on frivolous litigation and not enough on investments to generate jobs. 
Mr. President, this legislation is about perfecting the important reforms we passed in 1995 to protect our emerging industries as they strive to innovate and create jobs. Promoting job creation is one of my economic principles, and I am pleased to support this legislation today.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from South Dakota, our Democratic leader, a question. In all of his research on the bill, has he not found that this is a very compelling issue for women and for children, that there has essentially been a `moat' around access to medical treatment and, therefore, leaving it to the Senate or legislative bodies to make corrections, one procedure at a time, like drive-by deliveries, dumping of mastectomy patients? Would it not be better to take down the `moat' around medical treatment and do this in a comprehensive way, especially a way that it affects the women and children? Has the Senator found that?

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate that today I am introducing legislation to change the way we dispose of Navy ships that are no longer needed. I am proud to say that this bill is being cosponsored by my senior Senator, Paul Sarbanes, as well as the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator John Glenn. 
With the end of the cold war, the number of ships to be disposed of in the military arsenal is growing. There are 180 Navy and Maritime Administration ships waiting to be scrapped. These ships are difficult and dangerous to dismantle. They usually contain asbestos, PCBs, and lead paint. They were built long before we understood all of the environmental hazards associated with these materials. 
I am prompted to offer this legislation because an issue was brought to my attention by a Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles that appeared in the Baltimore Sun written by reporters Gary Cohn and Will Englund. They conducted a very thorough and rigorous investigation into the way we dispose of our Navy and maritime ships. They traveled around the country and around the world to see firsthand how our ships are dismantled. 
I must advise the Senate that the way we do this is not being done in an honorable, environmentally sensitive, efficient way. I believe that when we have ships that have defended the United States of America, that were floating military bases, they should be retired with honor. When I unfold to you the horror stories that the Sun paper found, you will be shocked, and I hope you will join in the cosponsorship of my bill. 
Let me recite from the Sun paper: 
As the Navy sells off obsolete warships at the end of the cold war, a little known industry has grown up in America's depressed ports, and where the shipbreaking industry goes, pollution and injured workers are left in its wake. 
Headline No. 1. No. 2: 
The Pentagon repeatedly deals with shipbreakers with dismal records, then fails to keep watch as they leave health, environmental and legal problems in America's ports. 
In terms of our own communities on the border in Brownsville, TX: 
In this U.S. shipbreaking capital on the Mexican border, where labor and life are cheap, scrapping thrives amid official indifference. 
And, I might say, danger. 
Also, even more horrendous is the way we use the Third World to dump American ships: In India, the Sun paper found: 
On a fetid beach, 35,000 men scrap the world's ships with little more than their bare hands. Despite wretched conditions-- 
And dangerous environmental situations. 
I point out what this means close to home. Let me tell you some stories. In Baltimore: 
Workers have been toiling in air thick with asbestos dust. In Baltimore, laborers scrapping the USS Coral Sea ripped asbestos insulation from the aircraft carrier with their bare hands. At times they had no respirators, standard equipment for asbestos work. [As we all know,] inhaling asbestos fibers can have . . . lethal consequences. 
It was not limited to Baltimore. At Terminal Island, CA, 20 laborers were fired when they told Federal investigators how asbestos was being improperly stripped from Navy ships. In Baltimore, workers were ordered to stuff asbestos into a leaky barge to hide it from inspectors. 
Dangerous substances from scrapped ships have polluted harbors, rivers and shorelines. 
The Sun paper goes on to say: 
A scrapyard along the Northeast Cape Fear River in Wilmington, NC, was contaminated by asbestos, oil and lead. `That site looked like one of Dante's levels of hell,' said David Heeter, a North Carolina assistant attorney general. 
Ship scrappers frustrate regulators by constructing a maze of corporate names and moving frequently. The Defense Department has repeatedly sent ships to scrappers who have records of bankruptcies, fraud [and] payoffs. . . . 
Because of downsizing, the Navy promised that this would be a bonanza, for amounts ranging from $15,000 to dismantle a destroyer--15 grand to dismantle a destroyer--to $1 million for an aircraft carrier. 
They buy the rights to Navy ships, then sell the salvaged metal. . . . 
Because of environmental violations and other issues, the Navy has had to take back 20 ships in yards in North Carolina, Rhode Island and California. . . . Of the 58 ships sold for scrapping since 1991, only 28 have been finished. 
And, oh, my God, how they have been finished. 
I would like to turn to my hometown of Baltimore. Mr. President, this is what the Coral Sea looked like while it was being dismantled in the Baltimore harbor. It looks like it was ravaged, like it was cannibalized. It looks like a tenement in a Third World area. 
The Sun paper continues: 
In Baltimore, torch handlers worked without other men on fire watch and without fire hoses. . . . 
Picture yourself going out there trying to do that in the early morning. 
The Coral Sea's dismal end has been marked by stubborn fires and dumping of oil in the harbor, by lawsuits and repeated delays--but most of all, by the mishandling of asbestos. 
Let me tell you that it was so bad that even a Navy inspector who came to look at what they were doing was scared to death to go on that ship because he was afraid it was too dangerous. 
I am quoting the Sun paper. 
On September 16, 1993, [the military] sent its lone inspector---- 
One inspector for the United States---- 
On his first visit to the Seawitch Salvage yard in Baltimore. . . . But Evans didn't inspect [it because]. . . . He thought it was too dangerous. 
The next day, a 23-year-old worker named Alfio Leonardi Jr. found out how unsafe it would be. 
He walked on a flight deck up in that situation and dropped 30 feet from the hangar. 
I felt a burning feeling inside. . . . There was blood coming out of my month. I didn't think I was going to live. 
He suffered a ruptured spleen, fractured pelvis, fractured vertebrae, and he broke his arms in several places. 
The inspector was new to the job when the accident occurred. He had only 20 hours of training on environmental issues. He was not appropriately trained, and he didn't even know what shipbreaking was. At the same time, we had repeated fires breaking out. 
In November of 1996, a fire broke out in the Coral Sea engine room. There was no one standing fire watch, no hose nearby. The blaze burned quickly out of control, and for the sixth time, Baltimore City's fire department had to come in and rescue the shipyard. At the same time, the owner of this shipyard had a record of environmental violations for which he ultimately went to jail. 
We cannot tolerate this in the Baltimore harbor. If you look there, that is where it is, right across from Ft. McHenry that defended the United States of America and won the second battle in the war of 1812. And look at it. That is what it looks like. It is a national disgrace that that was in the harbor as well as a national environment danger. 
Right down the road was the Baltimore City Shipyard, the Bethlehem Steel Shipyard that was foraging for work. Another fighting lady from Maryland, Helen Bentley, our former Congresswoman--she and I and Senator Paul Sarbanes worked for Baltimore to be a home port. We were desperate for work in our shipyard--desperate. But no; do you think the Navy turned to shipyards like Bethlehem Steel? They turned to the rogues, the crooks, the scum, the scams, to dismantle our Navy ships. 
I think the ships deserve more. I think the Baltimore harbor deserves more. And I think the United States of America deserves more. That is why I am introducing legislation to create a pilot project on how we can dispose of these ships, and in a way that is efficient, is orderly, and environmentally safe, and keeps the work in American shipyards, because while this was so terrible in my own home of Baltimore, MD, let me show you what was going on in the Third World. 
This is the U.S. Navy ships being dismantled in India. Thirty-five thousand people work on a beach, often with no shoes, dismantling ships with their bare hands. This is so dangerous, in terms of what they are doing, that I believe it is an international disgrace. I was appalled we were also exporting our environmental problems overseas. 
Mr. President, I called upon Secretary Cohen, when I read 
this series, to immediately stop what we were doing and to take a look. He did it. I want to thank him for his prompt response. He analyzed what they should do, and they made recommendations. But the recommendation was more enforcement of the same old way of doing business. Well, more enforcement of the same old way of doing business will still end up with the same old way of doing business--occupational safety dangers, environmental catastrophes, and a national disgrace. 
So that is why I am introducing my own legislation. The first section of the legislation will absolutely ban the shipping, the sending of our 180 Navy ships overseas to be dismantled in such despicable situations. The other part establishes a pilot project for the U.S. Navy to look at how it could put our ships out for dismantling bids in American shipyards that meet environmental and occupational standards. Those shipyards, like the ones in my own hometown of Baltimore, that are fit for duty. They know how to build a ship. They know how to convert a ship. They know how to dismantle a ship. 
I think the Navy can do better. The Navy has an outstanding record of dismantling nuclear submarines. They do it in a particular and unique way. They have the ingenuity and the technical competence, but they lack the will and the resources. What I hope my legislation will do is give them both the will and the resources to dismantle this in a way that retires our ships with honor. I knew that when the Senate saw those pictures they would be as taken aback as I have been. 
I thank the Sun paper for their outstanding series in bringing this to not only my attention but to America's attention. They won the Pulitzer Prize. But I want the United States of America to be sure that we win an environmental victory here. 
So, Mr. President, I am going to be introducing my legislation today as we speak. In fact, I send my legislation to the desk and ask that it be referred to the appropriate committees. I just want to close by saying that when we close military bases, we do it the right way, we pay to clean them up, we close them down and find other basic ways of recycling their use. 
Every weekend I am around veterans who wear the ships on which they sailed. They have the U.S.S. Coral Sea; they have a variety of the ships that they sailed on. They are proud of those ships, and I am proud of those ships. And I am proud of the military. I conclude by saying, I thank Secretary Cohen for his leadership as well as Secretary Perry. They have done more environmentally positive things for the military than we have ever had done. But this is the next step. 
I yield the floor, and I thank the Senate for its kind attention.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the IRS Reform and Modernization Act. It is now over six months since the House passed this reform measure. I am pleased that at last we are taking this bill up here in the Senate, and that we will be voting on this today. 
Let me tell you why I think this bill is so important. 
Others have spoken on the new projections that this bill will provide for taxpayers. I agree that they are very important. 
As my colleagues have noted, this bill will provide taxpayers with important new rights and protections. It shifts the burden of proof in many tax court cases from the taxpayer to the Secretary of the Treasury. It gives taxpayers an expanded ability to recover costs if they win their cases. It protects `innocent spouses'. 
The bill also will help taxpayers by changing the framework for interest and penalties and improving due process in matters regarding audits and collections. These are all important reforms. They will help ensure fairness for taxpayers. 
Mr. President, I really want to get to the heart of why I am for this bill. 
First, the Senate should know that I am very, very proud of the fact that the IRS will have its headquarters in Maryland. I want to salute the devoted men and women at the IRS who have worked under a very difficult set of conditions. They have often worked under a lack of leadership and often with a lack of technology. I hope that as we move ahead with the IRS reform package, we really remember and reward the dedicated and faithful civil servants who follow the laws that Congress passes. 
I must tell why I am so enthusiastic about this bill. It provides not only a new legislative framework, but a new culture and a new attitude at the top that then says to the agent at the grassroots level what is expected of him. Let me tell you why I think this new culture and new attitude is so important. I believe there is no doubt that the IRS has engaged in many inappropriate management practices. I know from my conversations with Maryland constituents that too many of them have been outright harassed by the IRS. 
I want to talk about two constituencies: the veterans of the State of Maryland and the firefighters in Frederick County. I think it is outrageous that IRS singled out these veterans of Maryland, and actually even stalked them over what they were doing in their VFW halls and their American Legion posts. The IRS wanted to penalize them because they had a little beer and a little bingo on a Friday night. 
Over the past several years IRS has targeted a number of veterans posts in Maryland. Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion posts have been subjected to audits, harassment and threats. What is their crime? They sell drinks and food to their post members and their guests; a little bingo and a little beer and a lot of IRS. Let me tell you, that has got to end. 
Every member of this Senate has veterans' posts in their state. We know that these neighborhood meeting places offer veterans a place for fellowship, entertainment and an affordable meal for their families and friends. The IRS believes that posts should have to pay taxes on these sales. 
Maryland veterans' posts report that IRS has confiscated their sign-in books. People have been subpoenaed. One post, the Dundalk post in the State of Maryland, was even threatened the loss of their nonprofit status. 
Ladies and gentleman of the Senate, these are the men and women who fought to save America, and I am willing to stand up today to save America's veterans from the Internal Revenue Service. And that is why I am going to be an enthusiastic voter for the final passage of this bill. 
What did our veterans have to do? They had to hire attorneys, they had to hire CPAs. Amazingly, the American Legion was told by the IRS they could not use post funds to provide this legal help. Then instead of offering to work cooperatively with the post to help them come into compliance, the IRS went after them in the most heavy-handed manner. They also said, `If you go to any Member of your Congress, we will get you.' I am not out to get anybody. But what I am here to be sure of is that our Tax Code is a workable one and that the people who work at IRS follow the law. 
Let me give you another example--our volunteer firefighters. Underline that, Mr. President. Volunteer firefighters, who put themselves, their lives on the line to save us and our families. 
One of the ways that they get money to be able to purchase a firetruck or other equipment is something called a tip jar. It is just a big glass jar which they have in taverns or other places; voluntary contributions to help a volunteer fire department. But, oh, no. Along comes the IRS and says even though you risk your lives, even though you do not have the backing of big city technology, we are going to make sure we are going to tax you for what you have done. 
To help the firefighters, the Frederick County Commissioners passed a local gaming law making it legal and less bureaucratic for the fire company to have tip jars in local taverns. The new law eliminated the need for the county tax processors to get involved in a voluntary philanthropic activity. But, no, the IRS had other ideas. They had to come after our firefighters. They audited the fire company. They informed the volunteers that they owed $29,000 in back Federal taxes because the money was not funneled through some local tax authority. 
What comes next? Are they going to be after the Girl Scouts when they sell their cookies? 
I believe an agency culture that identifies America's veterans and America's volunteer firefighters as the enemy is a culture in desperate need of change. 
So that is why this bill is important. I believe that we are not only changing the law, but it will change the culture of IRS. 
The Oversight Board this bill provides will work to ensure the best use of agency resources. It will help the IRS focus its priorities where they should be--stopping flagrant tax cheats and tax evaders, not going after veterans and volunteers who have made innocent mistakes. 
The National Taxpayer Advocate, and the system of local taxpayers advocates will help these groups navigate their way through an often intimidating and complex dispute resolution process. The special customer group dedicated to working with members of the tax-exempt sector will also be a big help. This division will be able to work with the non-profits to ensure they understand their responsibilities under the law, and to help them comply. 
Mr. President, before closing, I want to pay tribute to the devoted men and women who work at the IRS, often under difficult circumstances, inadequate and dated technology, and often poor leadership or supervision. I believe this bill will help them too. They have chosen to devote their careers to our government and to public service. They receive little recognition and little thanks. I want them to know I value their work. And I am delighted that the Oversight Board will include an employee representative. No one knows more about how to change the culture of the IRS than the employees themselves. This bill recognizes the importance of ensuring that they have a place at the table. 
I do want the IRS to focus on collecting the taxes in the most efficient way, and I want them to go after tax cheats, tax evaders, and drug dealers so that we can use the IRS to stop real crime in our country. There is no crime going on in the VFW or in the volunteer fire companies of America. 
I know this bill and hopefully now the new Commissioner will interact with different customer groups by working with them in a different type of way. 
I look forward to the fact that with the new leadership and the new legislation that we will really back the dedicated civil servants with this new framework and that we will be able to help them. But today I vote for reform of IRS. I stand here on the Senate floor in my own modest way to fight as hard for the veterans as they have fought for us and to stand up for protecting our volunteer firefighters. 
Certainly in the United States of America a little beer and a little bingo should not be penalized. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Senior Citizens Protection Act of 1998, introduced by Senator Baucus. I support this legislation for two reasons--it fights fraud and protects seniors. 
Fraud and abuse pose a serious threat to Medicare and Medicaid. We cannot afford to tolerate any more abuse of the system. The job of Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs) is to investigate and prosecute Medicaid fraud in state programs. MFCUs have prosecuted thousands of cases and recovered hundreds of thousands of Medicaid dollars. Every dollar saved by MFCUs is another dollar we can use to provide quality service to those who need it. 
This legislation expands the authority of Medicaid Fraud Control Units in two ways. It allows MFCUs to investigate federal fraud violations discovered during a state Medicaid investigation. Currently, MFCUs cannot investigate Medicare fraud or other federal fraud violations. Under the Senior Citizens Protection Act, MFCUs will be able to investigate federal fraud, and return recovered funds to the federal government. 
I am firmly committed to protecting seniors from elder abuse. This legislation protects seniors by authorizing to MFCUs to investigate patient abuse in residential health care facilities that do not receive Medicaid reimbursement. The number of residential facilities is growing, but local authorities often lack the resources to investigate elder abuse. MFCUs are already investigating elder abuse in facilities that receive Medicaid funding. But under the Senior Citizens Protection Act, MFCUs will be able to protect all of our senior citizens living in residential facilities. 
I want to let those who depend on Medicaid and Medicare know that we are fighting to stop fraud and waste. We have done an outstanding job in protecting Medicaid-covered seniors from fraud and abuse. It is now time to extend that protection to all of our senior citizens.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1997. As a member of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I am very proud that we have produced this bipartisan legislation. As a United States Senator, one of my priorities for Maryland is to work hard to keep our economy strong. This bill represents a real step forward in maintaining a robust economy for America. 
I support this bill for three reasons. First, it represents a comprehensive reform of vocational, adult education and job training programs. Second, it provides for the essential element of accountability. Finally, it streamlines the delivery service system into `One Stop Customer Service.' 
This legislation consolidates many of the narrowly focused programs which exist for job training and adult education. In the past, these programs have really represented no system at all. The patchwork of rules, requirements and bureaucracy did nothing but confuse the people these programs were designed to help. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act incorporates nearly 70 of these programs into a simplified plan. Allowing states the option to submit a `Unified Plan' makes the most sense for streamlining and simplifying the system. 
I believe, Mr. President, that accountability in training is essential. Programs must deliver what they promise. In exchange for giving States the flexibility they need to design and achieve strategies for reform, it is reasonable to retain some Federal control. Taxpayers deserve a dollar's worth of service for a dollar's worth of taxes. The standards for measuring state performance provide that accountability. 
In my state of Maryland, we currently have forty-one One-Stop career centers with more on the way. These `user-friendly' services are critical to helping people entering into employment training and placement. Providing core functions in one, easy customer service system is truly the focal point of the legislation we are voting on here today. One Stop centers have been proven effective both in Maryland and nationwide. I am very pleased to see the progress these centers have made and that they are the cornerstone of the Workforce Act. 
This legislation, Mr. President helps our citizens who are ready, willing and able to work. By giving the States and business communities more flexibility in designing their training programs, we are giving our citizens an opportunity for a new beginning. It gives them a new beginning to become more productive members of our workforce. It gives them a new beginning to get off the welfare rolls and earn the self-respect they deserve by earning their own money and taking care of themselves. 
The future of our country means making sure that our workforce is trained and ready to face the challenges of the 21st century. This means the federal government taking responsibility for getting our people off welfare and providing real solutions for getting them trained and helping them find work. By empowering our citizens with real life tools for success in the workforce we can achieve real reform of the current system. I am proud to serve on the committee that stepped up to the plate and showed the American public that we are ready to fight for our workforce.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today we are celebrating one of the greatest achievements of the twentieth century--the founding of the state of Israel. I rise to congratulate the people of Israel for a half century of independence--and to look forward to a future of peace and prosperity. 
The story of Israel is unique. A people forced into exile, who endured centuries of persecution, rebuilt their ancient homeland. They forged a nation where they could practice their ancient faith and traditions. They created an open and free democratic society. And always, they offer a home to Jewish immigrants from around the world. 
The founding of Israel followed the most incomprehensible and evil event of the twentieth century, when the Nazis--with the complicity of so many others--sought to exterminate a people. The survivors of the Holocaust helped to build modern Israel. Never again will the Jewish people be dependent on anyone else for their security. 
At first Israelis envisioned an agrarian society. But today, Israel is a center for technology and science. American scientists and engineers are working as partners with Israelis to develop the innovations of the next century. Our great federal laboratories, like the National Institutes of Health, are now working with Israeli scientists on a cure for cancer and other deadly diseases. 
America's relationship with Israel is also unique. We share common goals, values and interests. We stand by each other in good times and bad. 
Israel has had to endure five wars and live in constant readiness for battle. They live with the constant threat of terrorism. America must continue to stand by Israel--to make sure they have what they need to protect themselves. We must also stand by them in stopping their enemies from developing the weapons of mass destruction--and the missiles to deliver these deadly weapons. 
We all hope that the next century will bring peace to Israel and its neighbors. Five years ago, we witnessed the famous handshakes on the White House lawn. These handshakes heralded a new commitment toward peace. 
The peace process is now stalled. There is a crisis of confidence and a lack of trust. There has been a lot of finger-pointing about who is to blame. But let's remember how much Israel has given up for peace. Let's remember the Sinai and Hebron. No victorious power has ever given up more for peace. 
Mr. President: I salute the people of Israel as they celebrate fifty years of independence, and I look forward to a future of peace, prosperity and friendship.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Warner amendment to freeze NATO membership and, if time permits, to also comment on the Moynihan amendment regarding the necessity for EU membership for these countries before being included in NATO. 
It is very difficult--like you when you spoke earlier and said you had great admiration for both the Senator from New York and the Senator from Virginia as I do, we have such constructive relationships, and I admire their grasp on policy and their desire to move ahead on constructive foreign policy. 
As well-intentioned as the Warner proposal is, its acceptance would be inconsistent with the NATO treaty itself. It would unnecessarily limit U.S. flexibility in pursuing further enlargement should the United States of America determine that such enlargement would be in its national interest. It would also undercut the tremendous gains for peace accomplished over the last decade in Central Europe, including the historic reconciliation now underway between Russia and the West. 
Article X of the Washington treaty, which was the alliance's founding charter nearly 50 years ago, states that membership is open to `any other European state in a position to further the principles of this treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area.' 
NATO has been an unprecedented success in deterring conflict and promoting peace and stability. Toward these ends, NATO has been expanded three times in the past. To remain relevant and successful in the future, NATO must keep its doors open to those European democracies ready to bear the responsibilities, as well as the burdens, of membership. 
NATO enlargement is a policy deeply rooted in this principle, often driven by moral imperatives, but equally important strategic self-interest and objective criteria concerning military readiness and political and economic reform. 
It is not easy to become a NATO member. This is not like signing up for an American Express card. New NATO members must meet stringent military base criteria. They must also demonstrate a commitment to resolve ethnic disputes and territorial disputes by peaceful means. In fact, the prospect of NATO membership has led newly free countries in Europe to settle border disputes. 
Potential NATO members must also show a commitment to promote stability and well-being by promoting economic liberty, social justice and environmental responsibility. They must establish democratic and civilian control of their military, a transparent military budget and be fit for duty, as well as using diplomacy as its first tool of dispute resolution. 
You have to do that in order to even be considered. So, therefore, I oppose the Warner amendment because it would freeze or reduce U.S. flexibility within the alliance and, at the same time, close the door that article X gave as a message of optimism and hope. 
The Warner amendment would repudiate article X and its message of optimism and hope, which is what a freeze on enlargement would do. It would be seen by reformist countries of Central Europe as a door being shut. Do we really want to send such a disillusioning message to those other countries that are working for democracy, economic reform and civilian control of their military? 
Article X of the Washington treaty was a source of hope to Central Europe during Soviet oppression. The prospect of NATO membership remains an important incentive for democratic and economic reform. It has already motivated the reconciliations between Germany and the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland, Romania and Hungary, Romania and Ukraine, and Italy and Slovenia, among others. The civil and military agreements between these countries have helped to consolidate peace and stability in Central Europe, and these things must be protected and not undercut. 
Third, a mandated pause would create a new dividing line in Europe. If Central European countries not invited into NATO conclude that the process of enlargement has not only been stalled but stopped, a key incentive behind their current participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace Program, a military partnership, would be eliminated. A key achievement of this program is the coordination that it now fosters between their defense planning and force structure development. Thus, a freeze on enlargement would impede, if not reverse, this remarkable development of European security around an alliance-determined agenda. This is what NATO is all about. 
Fourth, an arbitrary freeze on NATO enlargement would harm Russia's historic reconciliation with NATO and the United States. A freeze would appear to give Moscow a veto over NATO enlargement. It certainly would be interpreted as a victory for the hard-liners by those who still advocate a Russian sphere of influence over its neighbors, those who wish to see that Russia could deny the entry into NATO of these three democracies. 
Worse, it could lead others to draw the conclusion that they will never ever have a chance to join NATO and never ever get out of the Russian sphere of influence. A freeze would undercut the basic principles that all of Europe's states have a right to choose their own security arrangements--a principle that must be one of the cornerstones of Russia's relationships with the United States and NATO membership. 
Mr. President, the resolution of ratification passed the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations 16 to 2, and on that day that it voted, March 3, 1998, it explicitly addressed the concerns of those accusing the alliance of moving too fast on enlargement. It states: 
The United States will not support the admission of, or the invitation for admission of, any new NATO member, unless . . . (I) the President consults with the Senate consistent with article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States . . . and (II) the prospective members can fulfill the obligations and responsibilities of membership, and its inclusion would serve the overall political and strategic interests of NATO and the United States. 
That is what the committee voted on, that we just would not have an open door but it would be an open door according to article X of the treaty we already adopted. 
Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues, no matter how well-intentioned--no matter how well-intentioned the Warner amendment is, I think it would absolutely undercut peace and stability. 
Mr. President, also in terms of the Moynihan amendment, I want to associate myself with your remarks in which you said we could not be part of NATO under that, Canada could not, Turkey could not. And if we then would adopt the Moynihan amendment, should we then consider an amendment that would remove from NATO any members that are now part of EU? 
What would that mean? It would take us out. It would take Canada out. It would take Turkey out. I do not think it is logical. 
I know there are many concerns about Russia. I know my time is limited and others wish to speak on this amendment. Later on this afternoon I will give my thoughts on Russia. I wish to maintain a constructive relationship with Russia, but I do not think this is the time nor the place to then give in to the Russian hard-liners but to focus on the new Russia, which I believe is not an imperial Russia. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we shortly will be entering into the closing hours of this debate. I want to take this opportunity to offer some observations about the ratification and also why this is so important. 
I would like to take a minute, though, to really congratulate the people of Israel on the 50th anniversary of the founding of that great state, and how special, unique, that we are debating NATO expansion and bringing Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO on the 50th anniversary of the founding of Israel. Forever and a day, I will always remember that we will have taken this vote at the same date of the anniversary of that state. 
It will be important because, as we commemorate, soon, the 50th anniversary of NATO and the 50th anniversary of the founding of Israel, just like the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, as this century comes to an end, we will look at what came out of the end of World War II that created the institutions that will take us, hopefully, to a new century and a new millennium, where we will not repeat the despicable and inhumane practices of the old century, or ever again have to fight another war in Europe. 
The Senate is about to take a historic vote and we are voting to make Europe more stable and America more secure. We are voting for a safer world. This will be one of the most important votes I will cast. Voting for a treaty is, indeed, a very special obligation, reserved only for the U.S. Senate. 
For those who have known me, they have known I have fought long and hard for Poland and other countries of Eastern Europe to become free and independent. I think about the dark days of martial law in Poland, when we worked to support the Solidarity movement in Poland. Since the end of the cold war, when the captive nations of Eastern Europe threw off the yoke of communism, I have yearned for this day. I have supported the aid that the American people so generously provided to help the people of Eastern Europe build free-market democracies. I have introduced legislation with former colleagues, Senator Brown of Colorado and Senator Simon of Illinois, to nudge our Government toward welcoming the newly freed countries into our Western institutions. 
My passion for this issue, though, is based partly on my own personal history. Each ethnic group in America brings their own history to this country. My colleagues have heard me speak about Poland's history many times in the past, because I have never believed that America was a melting pot. I always believed that America was a mosaic. We each come with our history and our culture and become part of something bigger than ourselves. So I come with thousands of years of history behind me, in terms of my heritage. 
The history of Poland has indeed been a melancholy one, because every king, kaiser, czar or comrade who ever wanted to have a war in Europe starts always, first, by invading Poland. It has been historically true for a thousand years, and it has certainly been true for the last 100 years. At the same time, Poland has always wanted to be part of the West in terms of its values and in terms of its orientation. 
It felt so passionate about democracy that when we fought our own revolution it sent two of its finest heroes, Kosciusko and Pulaski, to fight in the war for America's freedom. Pulaski came and was a brilliant soldier and led in the Battle of Savannah. Kosciusko was a brilliant tactician and led in the founding and building of West Point and, at the same time, then, fought for the democracy and became a great friend of Jefferson. He returned to Poland to help the Polish people of that time establish the first constitutional monarchy in Europe. 
Poland thought it would be free and have a constitutional monarchy, but that was not to happen. In the 19th century, Poland was divided into three parts, under Russia, Prussia, and the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire, and it remained that way. That is when my great-grandmother came to this country. She came, not because she just wanted to come and start a new life, she came on a prearranged marriage, because she wanted to forever escape that kind of occupation. 
This evening is not about history lessons, but Poland was occupied, partitioned, invaded in World War I, had a brief stint of democracy between World War I and World War II, only to be invaded by the Nazis in World War II and occupied. 
For me, growing up as a Polish American in east Baltimore, I learned about the burning of Warsaw. I knew about the occupation of Poland by the Nazis. I have seen films of the occupation, in which the great cathedral had Nazi storm troopers in there, burning the statues of the Saints and our Dear Lord himself, with their weapons. I learned about the burning of Warsaw at the end of World War II, when the Germans burned it because of the Warsaw uprising. Soviet troops stood on the other side of the Vistula River and watched it burn. 
Then we learned about the Katyn massacre, where Russians murdered more than 4,000 military officers and intellectuals in the Katyn Forest at the start of the Second World War, so there would not be an intellectual force in Poland, ever, to lead it to democracy. For 5 years our family hoped and prayed, hoping World War II would end, with my uncle serving in the military. And then, at end of the war only to see Potsdam and Yalta occur, where Poland was sold out. My great-grandmother had on her mantle, three pictures, one of Pius XII, one of my uncle who had become a member of the police force, and the other of Roosevelt, because she believed in the Democratic Party. After Potsdam and Yalta, she took the picture of Roosevelt and turned him face down, until the day she died. 
Those were the kinds of stories that I grew up with, looking at Poland as part of the captive nation. Then suddenly, in August of 1980, an obscure electrician, working in the Gdansk Shipyard, jumped over a wall proclaiming the Solidarity movement. And when he jumped over that wall, he took the whole world with him, to continue the push in this part of the century to free Poland. And then the movement, also of dissidents, spread. 
These are the kinds of stories. What I wear here today is a picture of the Blessed Mother of Czestochowa. She is the Patron Saint and Protectress of Poland. Members of the Solidarity movement wore exactly this emblem because they were forbidden under martial law to wear any symbol related to Solidarity. So they wore a religious symbol. I wear this symbol today because this, then, is the next step toward what we fought for in World War II, what dissidents in these countries have worked for--to create a democracy and a free-market economy, risking their lives, imprisoned, living under the boot of communism. 
So now those are the kinds of things that we must grasp. This is a historic moment, when three countries whose heart, soul, and political orientation is with us. So, I hope for those who worked so long and so hard, within Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, that we, then, understand the ratification of NATO enlargement. 
Despite the importance of history, my support for NATO is based on the future. My support is based on what is best for our country. NATO enlargement will make Europe more stable and America more secure. It means the future generations of Americans, I believe, will not have to fight or die in Europe. It will make NATO stronger. It will make America stronger. And it will make Western civilization stronger. 
Mr. President, I am only sorry my great-grandmother is not alive to see this, because when we vote to ratify this treaty, we will undo the historic tragedy that has often engulfed these nations and forever and ever, in the next century, ensure not only their protection but also ensure that despicable practices like the Holocaust will never again happen. That is what the 21st century is all about. That is why I will enthusiastically vote aye, when my name is called. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of a bill that will put an end to the half-promise the federal government has made to women screened under the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Protection Program. When Congress first passed this program as the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act in 1990, it was a breakthrough for early detection of breast and cervical cancer. And I was proud to be its chief Senate sponsor. There is still good reason to be proud of this program. By March of 1997, the program had provided mammography screening to over 500,000 women and Pap tests to over 700,000. Nearly 3,500 women have been diagnosed with breast cancer and an additional 300 women with invasive cervical cancer. In Maryland alone, by December 1996, the state had provided more than 35,000 mammograms and 21,000 Pap tests, and diagnosed nearly 300 women with breast cancer and 13 women with invasive cervical cancer. 
But when we passed that program we expected--and demanded--assurances that women who are found to have breast cancer be provided the necessary diagnostic services, including breast biopsies and treatment services. The program has not lived up to the promise. While a variety of innovative strategies have emerged across the country at the state and local levels to help women get treatment, the reality is that the system is overloaded. Some state programs require providers to arrange for treatment before they can participate in the program; a very few like Maryland have been able to come up with a small pool of general revenues, but generally these funds are available for breast diagnostic services, not treatment. In others, program administrators have to rely on public hospitals, donated services and charity care. In the end, thousands of women who run local screening programs are spending countless hours finding treatment services for women diagnosed with breast cancer. 
This is not what we had in mind. Not at all. The system for obtaining 
treatment services--which at its best was an ad-hoc patchwork--has broken down. Of those women diagnosed with cancer in the United States, nearly 3,000 women have no way to afford treatment--they have no health care insurance coverage or are underinsured. These women want to pay for their services, but they often simply don't have the financial resources on their own. 
It's a cruel and heart breaking irony for the federal government to promise to screen low-income women for breast and cervical cancer, but not to establish a program to treat those women who have been diagnosed with cancer through a federal program. Screening alone does not prevent cancer deaths; but treatment can. 
A recent study of the program done for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that while treatment was eventually found for almost all of the women screened, some women did not get treated at all, some refused treatment, and some experienced delays. The study also underscores the terribly labor intensive efforts that go into finding treatment for these women--often at the expense of screening. The lack of coverage for diagnostic and treatment services has also had a very negative impact on the program's ability to recruit providers, further restricting the number of women screened. It is sad that 8 years after enactment, the program serves only 12 to 15 percent of all women who are eligible nationally. And this is likely to get worse. The study shows there are already additional stresses on the program as increasing numbers of physicians do not have the autonomy in today's ever increasing managed care system to offer free or reduced-fee services. 
Breast cancer advocates from across the country are reporting that local programs are so badly strained that they have resorted to holding bake sales and community lunches to raise money for treatment services for the women they serve. Others have cobbled together the funds at great effort--when they are sickest--and most in need of taking care of their health. One woman in Massachusetts reported that she cashed in her life insurance policy to cover the costs of her treatment. 
It is clear that the short-term, ad-hoc strategies of providing treatment have broken down: for the women who are screened; for the local 
programs that fund the screening program; and for the states that face increasing burdens. Because there is no coverage for treatment, state programs are having a hard time recruiting providers, volunteers are spending a disproportionate amount of time finding treatment for women, and fewer women are receiving treatment. We can't grow the program to serve the other 78 percent of eligible women if we can't promise treatment to those we already screen. 
Women shouldn't have to hold a bake sale to get treated for breast cancer--especially if the federal government has held out the promise of early detection. It is an outrage that women with cancer must go begging for treatment. That's why I'm cosponsoring this bill. It will establish a mechanism for women to be treated. It will guarantee Medicaid coverage for necessary treatment services to women who are eligible for the CDC program, and found to have breast cancer or cervical cancer. Although I wish the bill would require the States to provide the benefit, the reality is such that we have made this program for now, an optional benefit, and place the responsibility on the States to choose to participate. By doing so, states would in effect, extend the federal-state partnership that exists for the screening services in the CDC program to treatment services. 
This bill is the best long-term solution. It is strongly supported by the National Breast Cancer Coalition representing over 400 organizations and 100,000's of women across the nation. I urge my colleagues to join in and cosponsor this critical piece of legislation and make good on the promise of early detection.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the expansion of NATO. And how appropriate that our friends, colleagues, and allies from the United Kingdom have joined us on the Senate floor just as they have joined us in battle and just as they have joined us in keeping the peace, and we welcome them with affection, admiration, and gratitude. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has returned to consideration of the ratification of NATO enlargement. I hope we will now have an uninterrupted debate. NATO enlargement deserves the dignity of serious consideration of this matter and to take such time as the Senate deems necessary. 
Mr. President, I support NATO enlargement because it will make Europe more stable and America more secure. It means that the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe will share the burden of European security. It means that future generations might not have to fight and die in a European theater. 
If NATO doesn't enlarge, the Iron Curtain remains permanent and the unnatural division of Europe will live on longer than the Communist empire did in the Soviet Union. NATO will remain, as President Havel has said, an alumni club for cold war victors. It will have little relevance to the realities of the 21st century. 
Mr. President, as a Polish American, I know that the Polish people did not choose to live behind the Iron Curtain. They were forced there by the Yalta agreement and by Potsdam and because they and the Baltic States and the other captive nations were sold out by the West. 
Many Members of the U.S. Senate have stood long for the freeing of the captive nations. Many of our colleagues have been strong supporters of Solidarity. I, as both a Congresswoman and then as a U.S. Senator, supported the Solidarity movement. I was a strong supporter of the Solidarity movement. I was with President Ronald Reagan in a wonderful evening he held at the White House where he hosted the Polish Ambassador to the United States who had defected when Poland had imposed martial law on its own people, there sitting with President Reagan and the Ambassador from Poland who chose to defect rather than uphold where the Polish Army had been forced to go against its own people. 
We pledged that we would make Poland free. And now Poland is free, but we have to make sure that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are not only free but that they are secure. That is why my support is for the expansion of NATO. My support for NATO is not based on ethnic American politics nor is it even based on the past, but it is based on the future. What will the new world order look like? 
I support NATO enlargement because it will make America and Europe more stable and secure. NATO enlargement means a future in which the newly independent countries will take their rightful place as a member of Western Europe. NATO played an important part in securing this freedom. It has been the most successful alliance in history. It is an alliance that helped us win the cold war. It deterred war between the superpowers and helped prevent confrontation between member states. 
But if NATO is to survive, it must adapt to the needs of a post-cold-war world, or it will become irrelevant. 
NATO has evolved since it was created in 1949. We have enlarged NATO on three different occasions. Each new member strengthened NATO and increased security in Europe. No expansion of NATO is easy. No expansion of NATO is done without thought. No expansion of NATO is ever without controversy. We can only reflect what the bitter debate must have been when we voted to include Germany because of their provocative role in World War I and World War II. 
Today, we are facing difficult and different threats to security. We have civil wars, as in Bosnia; we have hot spots caused by ethnic and regional tensions, as in Kosovo; we have international crimes, drugs, and terrorism; and we have the spread of weapons of mass destruction. NATO must change in order to meet these new threats. Europe's new democracies will help us meet those challenges. 
The countries of Central and Eastern Europe want to help us address these new threats. How many times has the Senate discussed burdensharing in Europe--and we want others to share the burden, not only in the financial cost, but of the risk to be borne in defending democracy. How often have we in the United States complained that European countries were not willing to pay their fair share for their own defense? 
Now, we have countries that are asking to share the burden. They are asking to pledge their troops and equipment for a common defense. They are asking to share the burden of peacekeeping. In fact, they are doing it right now in Bosnia, where thousands of troops from Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are helping to secure the peace. Hungary has made itself available, so it is our base camp to go into Bosnia. 
They have even committed to joining us and ending Iraq's chemical and biological weapon programs, which is more than can be said of some of our allies. 
These countries are not asking for a handout, nor are they asking for our protection without their own ability to maintain their own defense. They are asking to be full partners in the new Europe. By transforming their countries into free-market democracies, countries that have a democracy, a free-market economy, with civilian control of the military, transparent military budgets, wow, these new democracies are ready to join NATO. 
These new democracies will contribute to America's security by making NATO stronger. They are adding troops and equipment. They will provide additional strategic depth to NATO. They will also provide the will to fight for democratic values. Their history and geography make them passionate defenders of peace and democracy. They know what it means to be occupied and oppressed by tyrants, occupied and oppressed against their own will. They will put our common values into action. They will join with us in defending our national security and our values, whether it means peacekeeping in Europe or preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction anywhere in the world. 
Opponents of NATO enlargement have valid concerns, and I think we need to discuss them. First of all, opponents of enlargement point to cost. They say that NATO enlargement has a cost, and they are right. The new NATO members must modernize their military and make them compatible with NATO systems. The new NATO members have committed to pay this price. 
There will also be a cost to the United States. Our funding of NATO's common budget will increase. NATO estimates that the total common budget will increase $1.5 billion over 10 years. The American share of that will be $400 million, or $40 million a year. 
But what is the cost of not enlarging NATO? I believe it will be far higher. What will be the cost to European security, the cost to the new democracies of Eastern Europe, the long-term cost to America? And, most important, will the benefits of NATO enlargement outweigh the costs? 
As a member of the Senate NATO Observer Group, working on a bipartisan basis, I met recently with the Foreign Ministers of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. I asked them those very questions. 
The Polish Foreign Minister, Bronislaw Geremek, is a hero of the Solidarity movement. He said that Poland would feel abandoned once again by the West. He said that Poland will still pay to modernize their military. In fact, he said that the failure to include these three nations in NATO will cause them to spend more on their military budget. They also said they would form their own military alliance, which would be decidedly more anti-Russian than NATO. He went on to say that by refusing to enlarge NATO, we would give the hardliners in Russia a great victory. The antidemocratic forces in Russia would feel vindicated and proud. We would be handing them a victory that they could build on. 
What would be the long-range costs to America of failing to prepare NATO for the 21st century? The cost would be instability in Europe and the increased chance of being pulled into yet another European war. And the cost of preventive security is always less than the cost of war. 
I would like to discuss the benefits of enlargement, which I believe outweigh the costs. The strategic benefits of enlargement are most important. NATO enlargement will create a zone of peace and stability that does include Eastern Europe. It will extend NATO's stabilizing influence to more of Europe and reduce the chances of aggression or conflict in Eastern Europe. Enlargement will bring peace and security to Eastern Europe, just as it did for the West. 
There are also economic benefits. Europe is America's largest trading partner, with $250 billion in two-way trade each year. Our new NATO partners will increase trading opportunities. They are building vibrant free-market economies. Poland's economy is growing at 6 percent, which is more rapidly than many of the others. NATO brings stability, and stability brings prosperity. We are creating a prosperity zone across Europe. 
Mr. President, in the best tradition of the Senate, I could expand, but I know my colleague from Texas is waiting to speak as well. We are both involved in the supplemental. What I want to say is that the treaty ratification is one of the Senate's most fundamental duties. We are extending our Nation's commitment to collective defense. I certainly don't take this responsibility lightly. In the very best tradition of the Senate, we are addressing NATO enlargement as a national security issue, not a political issue. NATO enlargement is bipartisan, and it should be. It must be fully supported by members of both parties and the leadership of the Senate. 
We have worked closely with the President and Secretary Albright. The Senate has been fully consulted at every step of the process, as has been required by our Constitution. Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, our Republican and Democratic leaders, 
appointed a NATO observer group, chaired by Senator Roth, which has engaged in all aspects of discussing NATO enlargement, as well as the appropriate committees. So now we have had discussion at the committee level. Now it is time to debate this on the Senate floor. 
I am proud to support NATO enlargement. By ratifying this resolution, we are marking the end of the cold war and the beginning of a new century. We are building an undivided, peaceful, and democratic Europe for the new millennium. We are laying the groundwork for a new era of peace and stability. 
Mr. President, a new century is coming, a new millennium is about to be born, and I do not want the repugnant and despicable wars that characterized the 20th century to be carried into and repeated in the 21st century. That is why I believe in the expansion of NATO with these three countries. I look forward to a full and ample debate with my colleagues, Mr. President. This is a moment that I think is a long time waiting. We appreciate the leadership of President Ronald Reagan, who brought the end of the cold war, and Mr. George Bush, who was willing to defend and fight against the weapons of mass destruction. And now, under President Bill Clinton, we look forward to expanding NATO and to keeping that momentum going. 
I yield the floor.  
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the `Seniors' Access to Continuing Care Act of 1998', a bill to protect seniors' access to treatment in the setting of their choice and to ensure that seniors who reside in continuing care communities, and nursing and other facilities have the right to return to that facility after a hospitalization. 
As our population ages, more and more elderly will become residents of various long term care facilities. These include independent living, assisted living and nursing facilities, as well as continuing care retirement communities, which provide the entire continuum of care. In Maryland alone, there are over 12,000 residents in 32 continuing care retirement communities and 24,000 residents in over 200 licenced nursing facilities. 
I have visited many of these facilities and have heard from both residents and operators. They have told me about a serious and unexpected problem encountered with returning to their facility after a hospitalization. Many individuals have little choice when entering a nursing facility. They do so because it is medically necessary, because they need a high level of care that they can no longer receive in their homes or in a more independent setting, such as assisted living. But residents are still able to form relationships with other residents and staff and consider the facility their `home'. 
More and more individuals and couples are choosing to enter continuing care communities because of the community environment they provide. CCRC's provide independent living, assisted living and nursing care, usually on the same campus--the Continuum of Care. Residents find safety, security and peace of mind. They often prepay for the continuum of care. Couples can stay together, and if one spouse needs additional care, it can be provided right there, where the other spouse can remain close by. 
But hospitalization presents other challenges. Hospitalization is traumatic for anyone, but particularly for our vulnerable seniors. We know that having comfortable surroundings and familiar faces can aid dramatically in the recovery process. So, we should do everything we can to make sure that recovery process is not hindered. 
Today, more and more seniors are joining managed care plans. This trend is likely to accelerate given the expansion of managed care choices under the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. As more and more decisions are made based on financial considerations, choice often gets lost. Currently, a resident of a continuing care retirement community or a nursing facility who goes to the hospital has no guarantee that he or she will be allowed by the MCO to return to the CCRC or nursing facility for post acute follow up care. 
The MCO can dictate that the resident go to a different facility that is in the MCO network for that follow up care, even if the home facility is qualified and able to provide the needed care. 
Let me give you a few examples: 
In the fall of 1996, a resident of Applewood Estates in Freehold, New Jersey was admitted to the hospital. Upon discharge, her HMO would not permit her to return to Applewood and sent her to another facility in Jackson. The following year, the same thing happened, but after strong protest, the HMO finally relented and permitted her to return to Applewood. She should not have had to protest, and many seniors are unable to assert themselves.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2646, the Education IRA Tax Bill. I oppose this bill for three reasons. First of all, it is does not meet the education needs of America's children. Second, it does not support the mission of either public or private education. Third, it does not meet its stated goal of providing economic relief to America's families. 
Mr. President, this bill is ineffective in serving the education needs of our children. One of my priorities as a Senator for Maryland is standing behind our kids. I believe this priority should also be at the heart of the Senate's agenda. The bill before us does not reflect what America's priorities in education should be. 
Let me state clearly that I believe that education should be a non-partisan issue about what is good for our kids and the future of our country. Fighting for education does not mean pitting our schools or our people against one another. It should not be about private schools vs. public schools, or wealthier people vs. people with more modest means of educating their children. 
This is not what education is about. This is not what the business of the Senate is about. We are here to do the very best we can for ALL of the people of America, not just a select few. We have a duty to help ALL of the children of America to prepare themselves for the 21st century. 
We need to be able to look toward a future that promotes a sustainable, robust economy. A key element to our future is educating those who will be governing our future. We need to invest in our children's education so that they can skillfully navigate our country into the ever expanding world markets. They need the skills to become productive members of our workforce. Our children need the educational tools that allow them to understand the complicated economic mechanisms that govern our modern world. 
While the Coverdell IRA bill purports to be a pro-education bill, it does nothing to improve the education of the majority of our students. Coverdell does nothing to ensure our kids have the tools they need to cope with these important issues as future leaders and hardworking adult citizens of our country. 
Support for public education must be the priority for federal investment. Coverdell represents an actual divestment in public schools. The Coverdell bill costs $1.6 billion dollars over the next ten years and gives the majority of the benefits to only 7% of the families with children in school. Even those benefits are meager ones. For example, the average family with children in private schools stands to benefit only $37 a year in tax exclusions. 
This $1.6 billion can be much better spent following an agenda that truly gets behind our kids. The Senate should support and pass legislation that offers real solutions to address the problems faced by our schools. 
Students cannot learn in overcrowded schools that are falling down around them. Schools in every state in this country are in desperate need of repair. This year, K-12 enrollments reached an all-time high of 52 million children and they will continue to rise. It is estimated that we will need to build 6,000 new schools by 2006 to maintain current class sizes. Leaky roofs and overcrowded classrooms are the real problems that need to be addressed, not whether an average $37 per year tax benefit is what is best for Americans and education. 
We should target scarce federal resources to finance the construction and modernization of our public schools. These are the schools that 93% of our children attend. These schools will help many communities provide modern, well-equipped schools that can be wired for computers and technology so the children can get the education they need to succeed in the 21st century. These are also the same schools that may house after-school education and safety programs which our children need. 
We need to place our priorities on hiring new teachers. I supported Senator Kennedy's amendment to hire 100,000 new teachers and to make certain that they are well qualified in the areas we need them most. 
Under the 1994 Crime bill, we agreed to add 100,000 cops to police forces throughout the country. My own state of Maryland has added over 1,200 cops--who are out in the community fighting crime. I know what a difference they've made in preventing crime, and in ensuring that those who commit crimes are apprehended. Our streets are safer because of this program. Think what a difference 100,000 new teachers could have made. I am disappointed that this amendment was not approved. 
The Coverdell bill does not meet any of these dire education needs--for school repair, for school construction, for more teachers and smaller class sizes. It is silent on these critical needs. 
The Coverdell bill is ineffective in supporting the mission of either public or private education. I believe that public education--the choice of 93% of America's families--must not be shortchanged by the federal government. But let me be clear that I support our private schools as well. I am a proud product of parochial schools. What I am today I owe in large measure to the sisters who educated me in Baltimore's parochial schools. They nourished my intellect, and they nourished my spirit. 
So I know about the value of private schools and I support private schools. But I believe there are better ways to support private school education. The federal government already provides substantial assistance in support of private education. There are a range of federal programs that private schools can take advantage of which are designed to serve a variety of school student and teacher needs. 
For example, there are 366 private schools in Maryland that take advantage of `Innovative Programs,' a federal program available to both private and public schools. Innovative Programs supports a broad range of local activities in eight primary areas including technology, reform implementation, disadvantaged children, literacy programs, gifted programs and some Title I and Goals 2000 activities or programs. I believe that better use of the resources tied up by this bill--some $760 million over the next five years--could be better used through supporting existing programs that benefit both public and private schools. 
Finally, Mr. President, this legislation is ineffective in providing economic relief to America's families. I know how hard many families of modest means struggle to give their children the best education possible. The Coverdell bill has been presented as a tool to give these families some financial relief. But, that is a hollow promise. The average family with children in private schools would receive tax relief of only $37.00 a year. $37.00, Mr. President. I know that every dollar counts, but $37.00 a year is not going to make much of a difference in the average family's budget. 
The bottom line is that the education IRA will not fix our crumbling schools or help us bring qualified teachers into our classrooms. The education IRA will not bring the information superhighway to public schools. In fact, it will bring very little benefit to the majority of Americans and no benefit at all for Americans who cannot afford to contribute money to these savings accounts. 
For these reasons, I must oppose this legislation.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in firm opposition to S. Con. Res. 86, the Budget Resolution for fiscal year 1999. I do so with great disappointment. 
Mr. President, last year the Congress produced an historic budget agreement. We produced a plan to finish the job we started in 1993 of eliminating the budget deficit. We worked together--across party lines--to balance the budget, to protect our seniors by ensuring the solvency of Medicare, and to provide for key investments in education and health care. We also provided real tax relief for working families. 
I had hoped we would be able to continue to build off the framework of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act and Taxpayer Relief Act. Unfortunately, this budget resolution ignores the priorities that were at the core of those agreements. 
I will oppose this resolution because it does not reflect the principles and priorities that I believe must be part of the budget. I want a budget that preserves the safety net for seniors, gets behind our kids, provides for safe streets and a safer world, and provides for investments in science and technology. I believe this budget is defective in each of these areas. 
The Democratic budget alternative that was offered during our debate was strong where this resolution is deficient. It would have allowed for enactment of a comprehensive child care initiative to improve and expand the availability of quality, affordable child care and after school programs for school age children. No working parent should have to worry about finding suitable care for their child--a safe place with well-trained staff. The lack of adequate safe and affordable child care is a major concern of America's families. Our alternative would have gone a long way to meet that critical need. 
The Democratic alternative was strong on education. It would have enabled us to improve the education of our children through initiatives to reduce classroom size, hire 100,000 more teachers, and to ensure that children attend school in safe and well-maintained facilities. 
Our Democratic alternative was strong on Social Security. It made clear that before we spend one penny of any projected budget surplus, we should save Social Security first. Social Security is a sacred compact with America's seniors. We owe it to every senior citizen to ensure that Social Security is there for them, and that it will be there for today's workers when they retire. 
Our Democratic alternative was strong on health care. It would have provided for vital new investments in health care research. It would have ensured that the funds generated by a comprehensive tobacco bill--a priority for the American people--could be used to fight teen smoking, to conduct tobacco-related health research, to provide programs for people who want to quit smoking, and to help tobacco farmers move to new crops. 
I believe we produced a budget that should have had the support of a bipartisan majority. It was a common sense budget--that kept our commitment to a balanced budget, while providing for the sorts of investments in key priorities that are critical for getting our country ready for the next century. 
I am deeply disappointed that our alternative was rejected. The Budget Resolution before us now does not meet America's needs. I cannot support it.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to go on record today in support of the amendment to the Fiscal Year 1999 Budget Resolution offered by the Ranking Member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator Rockefeller. 
Mr. President, since the VA was founded, we have fought a World War, a Cold War and a Gulf War. From the World Wars to Korea, Vietnam to the Persian Gulf, each conflict produced a new generation of veterans with unique needs. 
The particular needs may vary somewhat for veterans of different eras, but one thing should never change - the commitment that we make to our veterans. 
Our veterans entered into a covenant with this nation when they agreed to risk their lives for our freedom. 
We must ensure that promises made must be promises kept. Our veterans must receive quality medical care, effective services and timely processing of benefits. 
I have fought for many years, and continue to fight, to ensure that our veterans receive the medical care and benefits that they have earned. 
Mr. President, our veterans didn't waiver when they put their lives on the line. When they were fighting to defend our liberty, risking death to ensure that we could sleep easy at night, they didn't waiver. 
Mr. President, we should not waiver on our veterans. The VA General Counsel issued a ruling in 1997 that veterans who develop illnesses linked to nicotine dependence developed while in service were entitled to compensation benefits. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs, beginning in Fiscal Year 1998, is due to begin paying those benefits. There is now a proposal before us to eliminate the VA's obligation to pay those benefits. 
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by eliminating the benefits, the government would save $10 billion. 
Well, apparently that money was too attractive to resist, and is included in the Budget Resolution to offset ISTEA spending. 
Mr. President, let me be clear. I support the much needed money that is going to provide critical infrastructure work throughout the country. And like many Senators, I am pleased to see federal support of transportation spending in my home state of Maryland. 
But Mr. President, our benefits for our veterans should not be traded and bartered. The funds that are due for our veterans must be protected. 
It is wrong to take money that is targeted for the benefits that our veterans have earned and use it for anything else - no matter how noble it may be. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Rockefeller amendment and prevent the raiding of these veterans benefits.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to stand today with my colleague from Missouri and the chairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, Senator Bond, to offer a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to the fiscal year 1999 budget. 
This amendment is designed to state the Senate's view that it is absolutely critical that HUD's section 202 program, which is its elderly housing program, absolutely be fully funded. That is what the resolution states. That is what I encourage the Members on both sides of the aisle to support. 
For years, I have been an advocate for an affordable and available supply of safe and decent housing for our elderly. For years, I have worked with Senator Bond to ensure adequate funding. 
In 1992, as the chair of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, I worked to successfully change the section 202 program from a very expensive loan program to a grant program. Do you know what? It allowed us to build more housing for less cost. I am concerned, though, that there is in the budget resolution a proposed cut of nearly $500 million in housing for the elderly. I am also concerned about the desire to move to more of a voucher approach to elderly housing instead of new construction, forcing the senior citizens of this country who need a modest subsidy to go out and kind of forage on their own to find housing that meets their needs. 
Mr. President, our Nation has many responsibilities, but its most important one is to protect and help all its citizens, but it has a particular moral obligation to look out for senior citizens. 
Promises made should be promises kept. This generation, which is now the frail elderly, organized to save this country and to save Western civilization during World War II. Many fought on the battlefront and many were the `Rosie the Riveters' who helped this country on the homefront. This is why we need to now look out for them as the frail elderly. The amendment I offer today with Senator Bond seeks to do this. They are our mothers and fathers, who raised and nurtured us; our aunts and uncles, who gave advice; and the neighbors who kept an eye on us; they are the people who we grew up with, who looked out for us in our communities; they are the people, in many cases who, with their blood, sweat and tears, helped build this country into what it is today. 
Mr. President, we have the moral obligation to ensure that we do what we can to ensure that those elderly citizens who need our help get our help. 
The AARP estimates that there are eight people on the waiting list for every one HUD section 202 unit that becomes available. 
Senator Bond has put that into the Record. 
Our subcommittee has done extensive research on this. What do we find? First of all, that the secton 202 program is the most popular HUD housing program we fund. Why is it popular? It meets compelling needs. It often stabilizes neighborhoods where people are `aging in place.' It also enables groups that are nonprofit and faith based to participate in providing housing. The section 202 Elderly Housing Program is important because it meets those needs. 
Since 1959, when this program was created under a whole other different type of HUD, we have funded 5,004 elderly housing projects, with over 330,000 housing units. They are primarily lived in by frail, older women in their seventies living with an income of less than $10,000. I think that is a good way to spend taxpayer dollars. 
The combination of affordable housing and supportive services under the section 202 program has been absolutely critical in meeting not only the housing needs but in promoting independent living, self-sufficiency, and dignity for the elderly, while delaying more costly institution. 
There are 1.4 million elderly Americans who currently have worst-case housing needs. There are 33 million Americans aged 65, over some 13 percent of all Americans, and this number is growing. That is why I have asked HUD to come up with new ideas on how we are going to meet, No. 1, the expanding elderly population, and, No. 2, the expanding frail elderly population. I believe that if we focus our attention and our resources, we will meet our needs. This is why I support the Bond amendment. It is the Mikulski-Bond amendment. 
My colleague, Senator Sarbanes from Maryland, who is the ranking member on the Housing and Banking Committee, also wants to be a cosponsor. 
I will conclude my remarks by talking about the voucher program. This Senator is never going to support a voucher program for the elderly. I will tell you why. When you are old, when you are sick, when you have a pain, when you have a walker, when you have a wheelchair, when you can barely read a newspaper without a magnifying glass, we are not going to give you a voucher, and say, `OK, kiddo, you are out there on your own.' We are not going to do that. Senior citizens should not have to go into the marketplace to forage with a voucher to find housing that would meet their needs. 
Mr. President, I know you have been in housing for the elderly in your own State. They have special architectural needs--low steps and special kinds of grips in the bathroom--all those kinds of things that, if they fall, they don't fail. You just can't put them in any kind of apartment in the United States of America; they have specialized needs. We can meet those needs. 
What is so fantastic--I cannot underestimate nor overstate the fact that faith-based organizations are involved in this. In my home State, the role of Catholic Charities, Associated Jewish Charities, and other organizations from the United Way step forward to make wise use of Federal funds and, at the same time, often value add to what the Federal Government is doing. 
I really encourage my colleagues to support the Bond-Mikulski amendment. It is cosponsored by Senator Sarbanes. I know that many others will join us. This is one of many budget amendments stating sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. This, I think, is not only the sense of the Senate, Mr. President, it is the sense of the American people. 
Senator John Kerry also wants to cosponsor it. Colleagues will be able to cosponsor it as we go forward. 
I yield the floor on this amendment. I really encourage my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wanted to rise very briefly and share with my colleagues the fact that a colleague who served in the House has passed on to God's glory. I knew her as a very dear friend. Congresswoman Bella Abzug died yesterday of complications of heart disease. I knew Mrs. Abzug as friend. I knew her as a wonderful Congresswoman. I want to state on the Senate floor how much she will be missed. 
Congresswoman Abzug fought for the rights of women. She fought for civil rights. She fought for human rights. She was known as `Battling Bella.' She had a very big heart and a very large agenda. 
I cannot believe that she died of heart disease, because if there was one fault that Bella did not have, it was heart problems. In fact, it was her very big heart that wanted to be sure that women were fully included in our society and enjoyed equal protection under the law in the Constitution. She wanted to be sure that she spoke out for the women of this country and that we also included everyone else who was left out and left behind. 
Also, when she left the Congress, she spoke very eloquently and added to her agenda the human rights of women and children all around the world. 
She will be deeply missed. Her hat stood there. You could always find Bella in a crowd. But when the history books are searched, we will find that Congresswoman Abzug is the indelible mark on the history of the United States of America for those who worked with her. She will be greatly missed. But, most of all, she will be missed by the people she fought for and championed all of her life.

Ms. MIKULSKI. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the `Medicare Social Work Equity Act of 1998'. I am proud to sponsor this legislation which will amend section 4432 in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which prevents social workers from directly billing Medicare for mental health services provided in skilled nursing facilities. I am honored to be joined by my good friends Senator Murray and Senator Wyden who care equally about correcting this inequity for social workers. 
Last year's Balanced Budget Act changed the payment method for skilled nursing facility care. Under current law, reimbursement is made after services have been delivered for the reasonable costs incurred. However, this `cost-based system' was blamed for inordinate growth in Medicare spending at skilled nursing facilities. 
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 phases in a prospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities beginning July 1, 1998. Payments for Part B services for skilled nursing facility residents will be consolidated. This means that the provider of the services must bill the facility instead of directly billing Medicare. 
Congress was careful to not include psychologists and psychiatrists in this new consolidated billing provision. Social workers were included, I think by mistake. Clinical social workers are the primary providers of mental health services to residents of nursing homes, particularly in underserved urban and rural areas. Clinical social workers are also the most cost effective mental health providers. 
This legislation is important for three reasons: First, I am concerned that section 4432 will inadvertently reduce mental health services to nursing home residents. Second, I believe that the new consolidated billing requirement will result in a shift from using social workers to other mental health professionals who are reimbursed at a higher cost. This will result in higher costs to Medicare. Finally, I am concerned that clinical social workers will lose their jobs in nursing homes or will be inadequately reimbursed. 
I like this bill because it will correct an inequity for America's social workers, it will assure quality of care for nursing home residents, and will assure cost efficiency for Medicare. I look forward to the Senate's support of this worthy legislation.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support this amendment to the fiscal year 1998 emergency supplemental bill. 
But first, let me extend my deepest sympathies to those communities and families who have had to deal with the loss and anguish caused by the terrible natural disasters over the last 6 months. 
From the ice storms in New England that left thousands without power, to the devastating floods in California, and the deadly tornadoes in Florida. Across this country in these States and in others, we have seen the destruction and despair that nature can cause. 
I know all Marylanders join me in extending our thoughts and prayers to everyone impacted by the recent disasters. 
Mr. President, this amendment will provide $1.6 billion to the Federal Emergency Management Agency to meet its requirements for fiscal year 1998 and prior years. 
Mr. President, FEMA is the Government's `911' agency. It is crucial that FEMA have the resources necessary to provide the type of response that our communities so desperately need. 
I am pleased that we are finally providing this money as emergency money--off budget. As you know, the VA-HUD subcommittee is annually raided to provide funds for disasters in our emergency supplemental appropriations bill. 
Often, the result is that we have to make decisions about cutting critical programs at agencies like the VA, HUD, EPA, NASA or the National Science Foundation to provide funds for the much needed emergency recovery efforts. 
Mr. President, this amendment also provides $260 million for the HUD emergency community development block grant--CDBG--account. This money will be used to provide funding for several critical needs: 
For disaster recovery needs in communities that are not covered by FEMA, SBA or the Army Corps of Engineers. 
This money is designed to fill the gap for legitimate emergency needs. 
Mr. President, I am a strong advocate for fiscal prudence. I am also a strong believer in the notion that this is a Government `of the people, by the people and for the people'. 
The emergency funds provided with this amendment is our way in Congress, in a clear way, of working for the people. When people are suffering, trying to rebuild lives, homes and communities, it is no time to be partisan. The citizens we serve deserve a swift, decisive and effective response. 
I am proud that we are working in a bi-partisan way with this amendment to provide the resources necessary to ensure that the agencies responsible can respond to the real needs of our people. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the Bond-Mikulski amendment and also to oppose the second-degree amendment offered by our colleague from Oklahoma. 
Mr. President, I want to support my colleague from Missouri, the chairman of the subcommittee on appropriations for FEMA, Senator Bond, in his remarks about the need for the reform on the funding of FEMA. 
Now, Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to say that during the last 5 years FEMA has reformed itself. Prior to James Lee Witt becoming the Administrator, FEMA itself in the way it responded to disasters was a disaster. Each President--Mr. Reagan and then Mr. Bush--often had to send in a trusted aide to oversee whenever disaster affected a community because FEMA itself was so obsessed with a bunker, cold war, civil defense, hide-under-your-desk mentality for nuclear warfare, that it had not gone to a risk-based strategy to be able to respond to the disasters that America faced. 
When Hurricane Andrew so devastated Florida that the response of FEMA itself was a disaster, President Bush sent the very able and talented Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Card, to Florida because FEMA could not get it together to do the job. 
I think we are all agreed that now FEMA has moved into being an appropriate agency for the post-cold war era. It has focused on the domestic needs of the American people. It has gone to being an all-hazards response agency for not only natural disasters but any of the other kinds of disasters that it has faced. It has worked with Governors and State agencies on three things: readiness and preparedness, response, and then rehabilitation after that response--the three R's of disaster response. 
Now, when we have responded, the need has spoken for itself. And that is what is in this year's appropriation--an urgent supplemental. This is the need. It is not a made-up need; just like it was not a made-up disaster. We are living in the year of El Nino. And El Nino is the weather event of the century and has really triggered a variety of natural disasters throughout the United States. As has been indicated in Senator Bond's testimony, there have been 17 Presidential disaster declarations this year in both States and territories. This $1.6 billion will address current needs and the total cost which will be generated from the current disasters. These needs are certainly emergency needs, just like over the last 5 years FEMA has incurred an average of $2.3 billion in obligations each year; and each year the VA Subcommittee absorbs the cost; and each year we take it out of other Federal agencies within our subcommittee. 
Now, we do not take it out of agriculture. We do not take it out of defense. We take it out of the 25 different agencies that are within the VA Subcommittee. We have already given, and we have given over a number of years. We cannot continue to do it this way. 
I support in the most enthusiastic and the most firm way the call of the chairman, Senator Bond, for a new authorizing framework on how we are going to fund FEMA. 
Lots of times, because of compassion or empathy, we then often repair things that might raise eyebrows. But in the midst of a disaster, no one wants to say no to community need. When it comes to disaster funding, we cannot have it both ways. When the Clinton administration has asked for a contingency fund to handle these disasters and emergencies, it has been dismissed as a slush fund. `Well, you can't have a slush fund. We'll do it as pay as you go. Let's see what the disasters are and make it up in the urgent supplemental.' Well, now we are making it up in the urgent supplemental and at the same time we know that this isn't the most desirable way to do it and therefore need the authorizers to set that policy. 
But I must say, the authorizers and the authorizing committees have not given this the attention it deserves nor have they had the same sense of urgency that is required when we meet disaster funding. So, therefore, for this year, please pass the Bond-Mikulski amendment; and also for this year's legislative session, give us a new authorizing framework, invite our participation, as well as the National Governors' Association, as well as the Director of FEMA, and have a bipartisan approach to how we are going to fund disasters in the future. But do not penalize the other agencies within this subcommittee because of the fact that El Nino and many other terrible situations have affected the American people. 
Our heart goes out to the people who have been hit by the ice storms in New England, and the horrendous tornadoes that devastated Georgia and Florida. There are these disasters. And if we are going to be in this, we have to have, No. 1, a new authorizing framework; No. 2, adequate funds, and, No. 3, maybe we have to also come up with new mechanisms where perhaps residents and businesses have a new insurance framework to be able to practice self-help. But we cannot do this today on the urgent supplemental. 
What we can do is meet obligations made which need to be obligations met. So I urge the defeat of the Nickles amendment, the support of the Bond-Mikulski amendment, and then let us have a new authorizing framework. 
I want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee for the way he has worked hard on this. We look forward to moving this legislation and meeting the obligations that have been made, at the request, I might add, of Governors. President Clinton doesn't make these up. For it to be a FEMA-declared disaster grant it has to come at the request of a Governor. 
I might add, when disaster hits, you don't know if it is a Democratic Governor, you don't know if it is a Republican Governor. We just know for all Americans it requires the response of the Federal Government.

<TEXT>
Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is a truly historic occasion. Today the Senate begins debate on the ratification of NATO enlargement. By ratifying this treaty, we are building an undivided, peaceful, and democratic Europe for the new millennium. I stand here to support NATO enlargement because it will make Europe more stable and America more secure. It means that the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe will share the burden of European security. 
It also means that future generations of Americans might not have to fight nor die for Europe. America has fought and won three wars in Europe: World War I, when an assassination in Yugoslavia led to years of bloodshed; World War II, the bloodiest war in history when thousands of Americans left factories and farms to fight on the battlefields of Europe; and we won the cold war, when Soviet expansionism forced us to prepare to defend Western Europe when the captive nations of Eastern Europe were forced behind the Iron Curtain. 
If NATO does not enlarge, the Iron Curtain will remain permanent and the unnatural division of Europe will live on longer than the Soviet empire did. As a Polish American, I and members of my family have been waiting years for this debate to occur. I know that the Polish people did not choose to live behind the Iron Curtain. They were forced there by the Yalta agreement, by Potsdam, and because they and the Baltic States and the other captive nations were sold out by the free world. 
My great grandmother had three pictures on her mantlepiece: One of Pope Pius XII, because we were Catholic and are Catholic, and that was her Pope; my uncle Joe, who was on the Baltimore City Police Department, and we were so proud of what he had achieved; and the other picture, of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, because of what he had done for working people. 
But after Yalta and Potsdam, my great grandmother turned the Roosevelt picture face down on her mantel and she let it stay there until the day she died because of what happened at Yalta and Potsdam. That is why many of us cannot forget the history of that region, the placing of a nation and the other nations, the captive nations, involuntarily under the servitude and boot heel of then the evil empire. 
But my support for NATO enlargement is not based on nostalgia, nor is it based on the past; it is based on the future, and it is support as an American. I support NATO enlargement because I believe that it will make America and Europe more stable and more secure. NATO enlargement means a future in which the newly free and democratic countries will take their rightful places as members of Europe. NATO played an important role in securing this freedom. It has been the most successful defense alliance in world history. It is an alliance that helped us win the cold war. It deterred war between the superpowers, and it has helped prevent confrontation between member states. 
But if NATO is to survive, it must adapt to meet the needs of the post-cold-war world or it will become irrelevant. 
NATO has evolved since it was created in 1949. We have enlarged NATO on three different occasions, and each new member strengthened NATO and increased security in Europe. 
Today, we are facing very different threats to security and stability in Europe. We have civil wars, as in Bosnia; we have hot spots caused by ethnic and regional tensions, as in Kosovo; we have international crime, drugs, and terrorism; and we have the very real threat of the spread of weapons of mass destruction. NATO must meet the needs of these new threats, and I believe it will do so by changing and expanding. Europe's new democracies will help us meet these challenges. 
The countries of Central and Eastern Europe want to help us address these new threats. How many times have we in the Senate discussed burdensharing in Europe? How often have we complained that European countries were not willing to pay their fair share for the European defense? 
Now we have countries that are asking to share the burden. They are asking to pledge their troops and equipment for the common defense. They are asking to share the burden of peacekeeping. In fact, they are doing it right now in Bosnia, where there are thousands of troops from Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Mr. President, Hungary is a base camp for our troops which enables them to be in Bosnia. These new nations have even committed to joining us in Iraq to help us deal with ending Iraq's chemical and biological weapons program, which is more than some of our allies. 
These countries are not asking for a handout; they are asking for a handshake, a handshake to welcome them into NATO. They are not asking for our protection; they are asking to be full partners in the new Europe and in the new world order. By transforming these countries into free-market democracies, they have earned this right. These new democracies will contribute to America's security by making NATO stronger. They are adding troops and equipment. They will provide additional strategic depth to NATO. 
They will also provide the will to fight for our values. Their history and geography make them passionate defenders of peace and democracy. They know what it means to be occupied and oppressed by tyrants. During the 19th century, Poland was partitioned among three countries. At the end of World War I, she had a very brief moment of democracy, and yet this is the nation that sent its own men to help fight in our war of revolution, went back to Poland and wrote the first parliamentary constitution on European continental soil, had an elected monarchy, and began to establish a parliament when many of the other countries had not even been unified. 
When we look at Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, in the days after Yalta and Potsdam, they rose with gallantry in terms of their dissident movement. We know about Charter 77. We, of course, know about Solidarity, and we know the role that dissidents played. In fact, the three foreign ministers who came here each had been in prison and even had suffered public humiliation at being dissidents in their own country. 
What do they say when they come here and come to NATO? They say they will put our common values into action. They will join with us in defending national security and our Western values, whether it means peacekeeping in Europe or preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction anywhere in the world. They are ready for us. I hope we are ready for them. 
Opponents of NATO have very valid concerns, and I would like to comment on just a few. 
First, opponents of enlargement point to the cost. They say that NATO enlargement has a cost, and they are right. The new NATO members must modernize their militaries and must make them compatible with the NATO systems. The new NATO members have committed to pay this price. 
There will also be a cost to the United States. Our funding of NATO's common budget will increase. NATO estimates that the total common budget will increase $1.5 billion over 10 years. The American share will be $400 million, or $80 million a year. That is a lot. 
But, Mr. President, what is the cost of not enlarging NATO? I believe the cost of not enlarging NATO will be far higher. What if we fail to enlarge NATO? What will be the cost to European security? What will be the cost to the new democracies of Eastern Europe? I can tell you, as a member of the Senate NATO observer group, I met recently with the foreign ministers of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and I asked them these questions. 
The Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, a hero of the Solidarity movement, said Poland would feel abandoned by the West and that Poland would still pay to modernize their military. In fact, in the absence of belonging to NATO, they would spend even more of their own money. The Hungarian and Czech Foreign Ministers agree that they would have to spend more money for defense if they did not join NATO. Also, they would form their own military alliances, which would be very decidedly more anti-Russian than NATO. 
The other foreign ministers said that by refusing to enlarge NATO, it would give the hardliners in Russia a great victory. The antidemocratic forces in Russia would feel vindicated and proud and would say that they themselves stopped the expansion of NATO. 
What would be the long-range cost to America of failing to prepare NATO for the 21st century? The cost would be instability in Europe and the increased chance of being pulled into yet another conflict. The cost of preventive security is always less than the cost of war. 
I also will take a minute to discuss the benefits of enlargement and weigh them against the cost. 
The strategic benefits of enlargement are important. NATO enlargement will create a zone of peace and stability that includes Eastern Europe. It will include NATO's stabilizing influence to more of Europe and reduce the chance of aggression or conflict in Eastern Europe. Enlargement will bring peace and security for Eastern Europe just as it did for the West. 
There are economic benefits. Europe is America's largest trading partner, with $250 billion in a two-way trade each year. Our new NATO partners will increase trade opportunities. They are building vibrant free-market economies. NATO brings stability, and stability brings prosperity. We are creating a prosperity zone. 
In addition, there are benefits for democracy. The young military officers of new NATO members are learning from us, learning what it means to be part of a democratic military, to be under civilian control, to have a code of conduct, also to have transparent defense spending budgets, no secret police. 
They are also learning English. When they leave the military, they will bring these skills. They will bring a sense of democracy. They will bring great skills to the operation of their free market. It is clear these benefits of NATO enlargement far outweigh the cost. 
Let me conclude by saying this treaty is very important, and treaty ratification is one of our most fundamental duties. We are extending our Nation's commitment to the collective defense. We do not take this responsibility lightly. We are extending our Nation's commitment to collective defense, the so-called article 5. We do not take this responsibility lightly, and in the very best tradition of the Senate, we are addressing NATO enlargement as a national security issue, not as a political issue. 
I am delighted and proud to say that NATO enlargement has been a bipartisan process. I remember when we began this debate some years ago with the really wonderful leadership of Senator Hank Brown of Colorado. It has truly been supported by members of both parties. We have worked closely with the President and Secretary Albright, and the Senate has been consulted every step of the way. I am proud to support NATO enlargement. By ratifying this resolution, we are marking the end of the cold war and we are also marking the beginning of a new century. We want the new century to be rid of the repugnance of the old century. We are laying the groundwork for a new era of peace and stability. 
Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I note on the floor is a distinguished war hero, my colleague from the State of Arizona. I was not here yesterday to lend my wonderful tribute to him on the anniversary of his release from a prison camp. I extend my great respect to the senior Senator from Arizona. 
When I visited Vietnam, I saw where they had taken the Senator prisoner. Obviously, he is a guy who will never let himself be taken prisoner. It is an honor to serve with him in the Senate and to enjoy these kinds of debates and discussions. God bless. Godspeed. Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of final passage of S. 1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. I support this bill because of its strategic importance to Maryland's economy and the national economy. 
To put it simply Mr. President, Maryland will receive more dollars for highways under this bill than it does now. Under this legislation, Maryland can expect to receive almost $400 million per year for its highway system and roughly $100 million for its transit needs. 
That means better highways, byways, trains and buses for Marylanders. 
Maryland's interstate highways are among the busiest in the nation. Funding under this bill will help maintain our highways and help relieve the congestion that so many of our commuters face each day. 
Highways and transit systems are the arteries for our economy. This legislation will help increase the capacity of our highways and transit systems, and will promote economic growth and job creation. 
This bill also means more money for transit, to keep our buses, trains and subways in top form. 
For Maryland, this means that our MARC trains, the Baltimore Metro, as well as our rural and suburban bus systems such as Montgomery County's Ride-On system will continue to receive the help they need to buy new equipment and expand capacity. 
The ISTEA bill also maintains the important programs for our environment to reduce congestion and improve air quality. 
It funds the development and construction of a state of the art Maglev system. Maryland is one of the states that has a Maglev project on the drawing board and could receive federal assistance to build the nation's first Maglev system. A Maglev line between Baltimore and Washington would reduce commuting time to less than 20 minutes between the two cities. 
While I am pleased at the funding for highways, transit, environmental programs and Maglev, I am disappointed that this bill does not provide full federal funding for the replacement of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. 
The bill provides $900 million to replace the Wilson Bridge. This is substantially higher than the $400 million that was proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
In my opinion, $900 million is a down payment. I am hopeful that funding and additional financing measures can be included as the legislation proceeds. 
Maryland and Virginia cannot shoulder a majority of the cost for replacement of the Wilson Bridge. It is the responsibility of the federal government, not the states, to construct a suitable alternative to the current bridge. It is my hope that this will be resolved in conference with the House. 
Despite my concerns over the Wilson Bridge, I believe this legislation will make major improvements to our nation's infrastructure, and Maryland's economy. That is why I support this legislation.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the `Safety of Imported Food Act of 1998.' I am proud to be the sponsor of this important legislation to provide the American people with safer imported foods. This legislation is part of President Clinton's food safety initiative. Its purpose is to provide for improved safety of imported food consistent with U.S. food safety requirements. 
The bill expands FDA authority to ensure the safety of imported foods in two very important ways. It authorizes the Secretary to deny entry of imported food products if it is determined that the products do not meet the U.S. food safety requirements. It also authorizes the secretary to consider, in determining whether imported food products meet U.S. food safety requirements, a refusal to allow necessary inspections or testing. 
Our nation's food supply has gone global. Once our imported food consisted mainly of bulk staples. Now we import growing quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables, seafood, and many other foods. Thirty-eight percent of all fruit and 12% of all vegetables consumed in the U.S. are imported. Imported food entries doubled in the last 7 years and a 30% increase is expected by 2002. 
We have been put on alert by recent cases of food borne illness. Michigan school children were sickened by imported strawberries contaminated by Hepatitis A. There have been widespread reports of cyclospora from imported raspberries. Soft cheese from Europe has been found to be contaminated with listeria and salmonella. And radish seed sprouts from the Far East have been found infected with Ecoli 0157:H7. 
The impact of unsafe food is staggering. As many as 33 million people become ill each year from contaminated meat, poultry and produce. Over $3 billion are spent in hospitalization due to food related illness. Added to that are the losses in productivity. 
Now that our food supply has gone global, our food safety measures must go global as well. Current authority requires FDA to rely on inspection and testing at the border to ensure that safety standards are met. With the ever increasing quantities of imported foods, it is impossible for FDA to inspect more than a small percentage of shipments. Additionally, such inspections are often impractical, given the perishable nature of many of the imported foods. The FDA may also place more general restrictions on imports, but only after a problem has surfaced, often after a major outbreak of illness has occurred. Both of these types of measures address the problem of unsafe food reactively. 
The `Safety of Imported Food Act' places the emphasis on the underlying food system of control at the food source, a more preventive means of addressing food safety. It focuses on the conditions that cause problems rather than the problem once it has occurred. By allowing FDA to consider the food safety system in place, the bill provides the means by which FDA can use its limited resources more efficiently. 
There are several things this bill does not do. It does not shut our borders or immediately deny entry of imported food upon enactment. It does not require inspections or access without consent. In fact, it does not create any new inspection authority, either foreign or domestic. 
The bill is short, but what it will achieve is significant. It will provide FDA with authority to ensure that all imported foods meet the U.S. level of protection, consistent with rights and obligations under international trade agreements. It provides FDA with a more effective enforcement tool and the ability to use its resources more effectively. Under the bill, foreign producers may have an incentive to upgrade their food safety systems. Most importantly, the bill will provide the American public with greater assurance that imported foods meet the same safety standards as do foods produced in the U.S. 
I wish to commend President Clinton and Vice President Gore in making food safety a top priority. By strengthening the food supply both here and abroad, I believe we make the world a safer place to live. I look forward to the Senate's support of this important legislation.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for this arrangement. 
Mr. President, It is a great honor for me to support the nomination of Dr. Satcher. 
I enthusiastically support his nomination to be Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health. 
This position, which serves as the nation's spokesperson on public health issues, has been vacant far too long. When I decide whether to support a nominee, I look at the nominee's competence and personal and professional integrity. Dr. Satcher is highly competent. Dr. Satcher has the greatest personal and professional integrity of any nominee who has come before our Committee in recent years. Dr. Satcher has a truly remarkable story. He's overcome substantial odds and hardships. He graduated from that great institution Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, where Dr. Martin Luther King graduated and thousands of African-American men. 
At a time when there were few African-American physicians in our country, Dr. Satcher attended Case Western University in Cleveland, Ohio, where he received his medical degree. Dr. Satcher was the first African-American to earn an M.D. and a Ph.D. at Case Western. He was later a professor at Charles R. Drew Medical School in Los Angeles, California and returned to his alma mater, Morehouse, to become the head of the school of Medicine there. He served as president of Meharry Medical School in Nashville, Tennessee from 1982 to 1993 before becoming the director of the Centers for Disease Control. 
I have worked closely with Dr. Satcher, when he was the head of the Centers for Disease Control. He was enormously helpful and responsive with my state's psfesteria crisis. 
During his tenure at the Centers for Disease Control Dr. Satcher established himself as a very capable leader in the arena of public health. He aggressively took on the responsibilities of promoting health and preventing disease, injury and premature death. Whether it was increasing childhood immunization rates, expanding the breast and cervical cancer screening program, researching effective treatments for AIDS, or stressing preventive measures in pursuing good health, Dr. Satcher has done an excellent job. 
I admire his work on the issues of minority health, especially sickle cell anemia, which affects mostly African-Americans. I also admire Dr. Satcher's courage to look at the link between guns and the public health. Too many young African-American men are being killed by gun violence in our cities. I was also pleased with the way Dr. Satcher took on the issue of food safety. 
I am very concerned about recent incidents which have forced us to take a good look at the safety of our food supply. 
Dr. Satcher was on cue when he laid the groundwork for a new Early Warning System to detect and prevent food-borne illnesses. This initiative will help respond to outbreaks of food-borne illness earlier, and give us the data we need to prevent future outbreaks. 
The work Dr. Satcher has accomplished at CDC, along with his experience as a physician and scholar before that, directly prepare him for the role of a good surgeon general. 
As Surgeon General, Dr. Satcher will be America's advisor on public health issues and the national leader in developing public health strategies. 
I know Dr. Satcher will provide this country with a strong voice for public health. I wholeheartedly endorse this nominee. I urge my colleagues to support Dr. Satcher's nomination.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I voted in support of renaming Washington National Airport as the Ronald Reagan National Airport. 
I am aware of the concerns about the need for local control over the airport. That's why I voted in favor of the Daschle Amendment that would have given the Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority the final say over renaming the airport. I have always been a strong supporter of local control over National Airport. 
However, in the end, I decided that the decision to rename National Airport should rise above party politics. My decision to support S. 1575 was a personal one. 
It's no secret that I didn't always agree with President Reagan's policies. As a matter of fact, when it came to politics, President Reagan and I disagreed quite often. However, Ronald Reagan and I shared one important thing: our respect for the Presidency. 
President Reagan devoted much of his life to serving the people of this country--first as the Governor of California, then as our President. For that reason, he deserves our respect. He has mine. No matter how different our political viewpoints were, I have always respected President Reagan and always will. 
In the twilight of his distinguished life, President Reagan and I have something else in common. Like the President, my father suffered from Alzheimer's disease. I know how devastating this illness is and the strength it requires from a family. My thoughts and prayers are with Mrs. Reagan and all of the President's family. One thing I learned during my father's illness was the importance of gestures. Renaming National Airport as the Ronald Reagan National Airport is a gesture that I support. 
Today, like many of my fellow Senators, I saluted President Reagan. While I would have preferred that the decision was made by the Airports Authority, I believe it is the end that matters, not the means. That is why I voted in favor of this bill. 
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the Senate passage of the Mammography Quality Standards Act. I am delighted that the Senate acted on Sunday, November 9 to unanimously approve this important legislation. The bill that the Senate has now passed reauthorizes the original legislation which passed in 1992 with bipartisan support. This year's bill is presented to the Senate with 55 cosponsors. 
What MQSA does is require that all facilities that provide mammograms meet key safety and quality-assurance standards in the area of personnel, equipment, and operating procedures. Before the law passed, tests were misread, women were misdiagnosed, and people died as a result of sloppy work. Since 1992, MQSA has been successful in bringing facilities into compliance with the federal standards. 
What are these national, uniform quality standards for mammography? Well, facilities are required to use equipment designed specifically for mammography. Only radiological technologists can perform mammography. Only qualified doctors can interpret the results of mammography. Facilities must establish a quality assurance and control program to ensure reliability, clarity and accurate interpretation of mammograms. Facilities must be inspected annually by qualified inspectors. Finally, facilities must be accredited by an accrediting body approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
This current reauthorization makes a few minor changes to the law to ensure the following: Patients and referring physicians must be advised of any mammography facility deficiency. Women are guaranteed the right to obtain an original of their mammogram. Finally, both state and local government agencies are permitted to have inspection authority. 
I like this law because it has saved lives. The front line against breast cancer is mammography. We know that early detection saves lives. But a mammogram is worse than useless if it produces a poor-quality image or is misinterpreted. The first rule of all medical treatment is: Above all things, do no harm. And a bad mammogram can do real harm by leading a woman and her doctor to believe that nothing is wrong when something is. The result can be unnecessary suffering or even a death that could have been prevented. That is why this legislation is so important. This law needs to be reauthorized so that we don't go back to the old days when women's lives were in jeopardy. 
A strong inspection program under MQSA is extremely important to ensure the public that quality standards are being met. In a GAO report which evaluated the MQSA inspection program, GAO praised the program. They also recommended changes to further strengthen the program. FDA is in the process of implementing these recommendations. The FDA has proposed to direct its attention to conducting comprehensive inspections on those facilities where problems have been identified in the past, while decreasing the extensiveness of inspections at those facilities with excellent compliance records. I think it is important for the FDA to move promptly in this direction. The best way to protect the public health is for the FDA to focus its resources on the problem facilities. 
I want to make sure that women's health needs are met comprehensively. It is expected that 180,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed and about 44,000 women will die from the disease in 1997. This makes breast cancer the most common cancer among women. And only lung cancer causes more deaths in women. 
We must aggressively pursue prevention in our war on breast cancer. I pledge to fight for new attitudes and find new ways to end the needless pain and death that too many American women face. This bill is an important step in that direction. 
As the 105th Congress comes to a close, we can look back on some great bipartisan victories and other great partisan frustrations. But one area Republicans and Democrats have always worked together on is women's health. I am proud of this bill's broad bipartisan support. I want to take this opportunity to thank all the cosponsors for making this happen. A special thanks to Senator Jeffords for working with me on making passage of this bill a reality. As Dean of the Democratic Women, I want to also thank the Dean of the Republican Women, Kay Bailey Hutchison, for always reaching out to work together on the issues that matter most to American women and their families. 
Still, Senate passage alone does not assure reauthorization. It is my hope that the strong show of bipartisan support for this bill here in the Senate will encourage the House of Representatives to promptly move forward on this bill. I hope they will follow our lead to ensure a quick reauthorization of MQSA. America's women are counting on it.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am so happy this day has finally come, in which the U.S. Senate, and I believe the House, will pass a conference report to modernize the Food and Drug Administration and to bring it into a 21st century framework. 
I want to thank Senator Jeffords for the patient leadership he has provided in moving this bill, and a special thanks for the collegiality of his staff in working with mine. I also would like to acknowledge the special role that Senator Coats has played. I have enjoyed working with him these last 3 years. We will miss him here as he undertakes next year a new life in encouraging faith-based community groups to become more involved. I think in this bipartisan collegial exchange we have come up with an outstanding bill that is going to save lives, save jobs in the United States of America, give us a product to export around the world that is translingual, transcultural, but certainly helps our people and at the same time puts patients first. 
I want to particularly thank my own staff, Lynne Lawrence, for the active work she has done, and Roberta Haeberle and Kerry O'Toole in the excellent backup they have provided. 
Why do I like this bill? First of all, we reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. What this will mean is we will be able to have 600 reviewers who will be able to work at the Food and Drug Administration making sure that we cut the review time, streamline the process, be able to move drugs, biologics and devices for clinical practice in a more expedited fashion, and at the same time be able to protect safety and efficacy. We do protect safety and efficacy while we move along at a quicker step with more people. 
A reauthorization of PDUFA gives us the right people and now we have the right legislative framework to do it. One of the important aspects of this legislation is the streamlining process, and yet at the same time maintaining safety and efficacy upon the approval process so more and more clinical things will be able to go into clinical practice. 
I am delighted that this day has finally arrived. It is a great day for patients and physicians. They will get new medical products in a more timely and efficient manner. It is a great day for American business. They won't have to go through unnecessary regulatory hoops to get these new products on the market. 
This legislation, carefully crafted between the House and Senate, represents a solid, bipartisan effort. We could not have reached this point without the incredible dedication and persistence of the chairman of the Labor Committee, Mr. Jeffords. I thank him for his heartfelt devotion to this bill, and for never giving up. I also thank his staff, Jay Hawkins, Sean Donohue, and Mark Powden for all their hard work. 
Let me also acknowledge the tremendous contributions of our ranking member, Mr. Kennedy. There is no doubt this is a better bill because of his efforts. I also want to acknowledge the hard work of our counterparts in the House, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Mr. Bliley and the ranking member, Mr. Dingell. Many thanks also go to the fine staff of the Commerce Committee for their excellent work. 
Mr. President, I have worked on FDA reform for a number of years. When I was a Member of the House of Representatives, we embarked, on a bipartisan basis, to ensure consumer protection and to prevent dumping drugs that did not meet our standards on Third World countries. 
Coming to the Senate, I joined with my colleague from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, in fashioning the Prescription Drug User Fee Act [PDUFA]. PDUFA has enabled FDA to hire more people to examine products that were being presented for evaluation and get them to patients more quickly. 
The leadership of Kennedy-Hatch on PDUFA has not only stood the test of time, it has shown that we can expedite the drug approval process while maintaining safety and efficacy. I am so pleased that this successful legislation will be reauthorized for 5 years. 
But while PDUFA has made a huge difference, it became clear PDUFA was not enough. More staff operating in an outdated regulatory framework, without a clear legislative framework, was deficient. 
That is when we began to consult with experts in public health, particularly those involved in drugs and biologics. While we were considering all this, the world of science was changing. We experienced a revolution in biology. We went from a smokestack economy to a cyberspace economy. We went from basic discoveries in science from the field of chemistry and physics to a whole new explosion in biology, in genetics and biologic materials. 
It became clear we needed an FDA with a new legislative framework and a new culture. This is when we began to put together what we called the sensible center on FDA reform. We worked with Republicans and Democrats alike, because we certainly never want to play politics with the lives of the American people. 
Senator Kassebaum chaired the committee during this initiative. We took important steps forward. I say to Senator Jeffords, you assumed that mantle, and you brought us to the point today where we will achieve final passage of FDA reform. I thank you for that. 
What will this legislation do? Why is it so important? It streamlines and updates the regulatory process for new products. It reauthorizes the highly successful Prescription Drug User Fee Act. And it creates an FDA that rewards significant science while protecting public health. 
It will mean that new lifesaving drugs and devices will get into clinical practice more quickly. It will enable us to produce products that we can sell around the world, and through this, save lives and generate jobs. 
FDA is known the world over as the gold standard for product approval. We want to maintain that high standard. At the same time, we want to make sure that FDA can enter the 21st century. 
This legislation gets us there. It sets up a new legislative and regulatory framework that reflects the latest scientific advancements. The framework continues FDA's strong mission to protect public health and safety. At the same time, it sets a new goal for FDA, enhancing public health by not impeding innovation or product availability through unnecessary redtape that only delays approval. 
There has been an urgency about reauthorizing PDUFA. Its authority expires at the end of September. PDUFA has enabled FDA to hire 600 new reviewers and cut review times from 29 to 17 months over the last 5 years. Acting now means that people who have been working on behalf of the American people can continue to do their jobs. We won't risk losing talented employees and slowing down the drug approval process. 
Delay would have hurt dedicated employees, but more importantly, it would have hurt patients. Patients benefit most from this legislation. Safe and effective new medicines will be getting to patients quicker. 
We're not only extending PDUFA; we're improving it. Currently, PDUFA only addresses the review phase of the approval process. Our legislation expands PDUFA to streamline the early drug development phase as well. 
Instead of a carload of paper--stacks and stacks of material--being deposited at the FDA's front door, companies will be able to make electronic submissions. This not only reduces paperwork, but actually provides a more agile way for scientific reviewers to get through the data. 
Updating the approval process for biotech is another critical component of this bill. Biotech is one of the fastest growing industries in our country. There are 143 biotech companies like that in my own State of Maryland. They are working on AIDS, Alzheimer's, breast and ovarian cancer, and other life-threatening infections such as whooping cough. 
The job of FDA is to make sure that safe and effective products get to patients. Our job as Members of Congress is to fund scientific research and to provide FDA the regulatory and legislative frameworks to evaluate new products and make them available to doctors and patients. 
This is why I fought so hard for this. This is exactly why I fought for this. My dear father died of Alzheimer's, and it did not matter that I was a U.S. Senator. I watched my father die one brain cell at a time, and it did not matter what my job was. 
My father was a modest man. He did not want a fancy tombstone or a lot of other things, but I vowed I would do all I can for research in this and to help other people along these lines. 
Every one of us has faced some type of tragedy in our lives where we looked to the American medical and pharmaceutical, biological, and device community to help us. 
When my mother had one of her last terrible heart attacks that was leading rapidly to a stroke--there was a new drug that is so sophisticated that it must be administered very quickly. You need informed consent because even though it is approved, it is so dramatic that it thins the blood almost to the hemophilia level. I gave that approval because my mother was not conscious enough to do it. 
Guess what? That new drug approved by FDA, developed in San Francisco, got my mother through her medical crisis with the hands-on care of the Sisters of Mercy in Baltimore at Mercy Hospital. Mother did not have a stroke because we could avoid the clotting that would have precipitated it. 
Thanks to the grace of God and the ingenuity of American medicine, we had my mother with us 100 more days in a way that she could function at home, have conversations with us and her grandchildren. 
Do you think I am not for FDA? You think I am not for safety? You think I am not for efficacy? You bet I am. And this is what this is all about. It is not a battle of wills. It is not a battle over this line item or that line item. It is really a battle to make sure that the American people have from their physicians and clinical practitioners the best devices and products to be able to save lives. That's why I'm so pleased that we were able to achieve a bipartisan bill. 
So, Mr. President, I thank you for the time. If I seem a little emotional about it, you bet I am. I love FDA. I am really proud they are in my State. I thank God for the ingenuity of the American medical community. And that is why I am so pleased we will be voting on the conference report today. 
All of us are happy that this bill will finally pass.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Snowe in submitting the Enclaved People of Cyprus concurrent resolution. This legislation puts the Congress on record in support of human rights and freedom for all the people of Cyprus. 
In 1974 Turkish troops invaded Cyprus and divided the island. For 23 years, the people of Cyprus have lived under an immoral and illegal occupation. The enclaved people in the northern part of the island have suffered most. Their travel is restricted. They may not attend the school of their choice. Their access to their religious sites is restricted. They are often harassed and discriminated against. 
The United Nations and the European Union have documented these human rights abuses and have called on the Turkish Cypriots to respect the basic freedoms of the Greek-Cypriots and Maronites living in the northern part of the island. 
Our foreign policy must reflect our values. The legislation we are introducing calls for an end to the restrictions on the freedoms of the enclaved people in the occupied part of Cyprus. It states that Congress will remain active until the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the enclaved people of Cyprus are restored, respected and safeguarded. 
Mr. President, I am hopeful that this year we will bring peace to Cyprus. But our efforts to improve human rights on the island cannot wait. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice. I'm here today because I believe that Bill Lann Lee should be favorably reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He should have his day. He should have a vote on the floor of the Senate. 
I've heard of Bill Lann Lee for a number of years. I've heard about this exceptional person, who brings a great deal of legal competency, energy, and vitality to advocating for those who have been left out of the mainstream. Contrary to what my Republican colleagues have asserted, Mr. Lee has used the law for the benefit of all Americans. It is so obvious from his record that he loves the law and uses it as a tool to help those in our society who need help. 
I was troubled when I heard his nomination was being stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Once again a capable person in the field of civil rights law, a person of color, was being stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
I feel so strongly about this nomination and about what Mr. Lee's advocacy has meant for not only people of color but for women, for the disabled, and those who are either overlooked or undermined by the law. I felt so strongly that I organized the Democratic women of the Senate to write a letter to Chairman Orrin Hatch asking to free Mr. Lee from the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
But because it is the Senate Judiciary Committee my letter used language far more judicious than that which is being used against Mr. Lee. My letter, which is signed by all the Democratic women Senators, urges favorable consideration of Mr. Lee's nomination. We bring to Chairman Hatch's attention that Mr. Lee has dedicated his entire career to enforcing civil rights laws. 
He has 23 years of professional experience ranging from cases dealing with employment discrimination, providing access to health care, helping children who have been victims of lead poisoning, to making public transportation accessible for the disabled, and then guess what, fighting for something called equal access to education. 
Isn't this exactly who we want to be heading up the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice--someone who has practiced mainstream civil rights law, who believes in opportunity for everyone, and who has pursued this under the law? 
We have sent this letter; I don't know what the response will be, but I will tell you once again it's the fall, so it must be the Senate Judiciary Committee. Once again, someone comes before the Senate Judiciary Committee with incredible legal competence, who is willing to serve the Nation and to come forth before the Senate Judiciary Committee only to once again face a humiliating experience. 
We don't want Bill Lann Lee to be the Anita Hill of 1997. I think it's outrageous that once again we have someone with a great background who is going to be stymied and humiliated. This is not what America is all about. 
We've heard about Mr. Lee's exceptional background. The hard work of his family, their willingness to fight for this country, and Mr. Lee's work to fight in the courtrooms to make sure the law works for everyone. 
It is not fair that after having an exemplary professional record, to be a person of judicial temperament, to bring these great qualities to this position, Mr. Lee has to face this. Now I don't think that the U.S. Senate should be a forum for attacking Chinese-Americans. I just don't think that's right. We have seen them attacked in hearings on campaign finance and now we hear them being attacked in the Senate Judiciary Committee. I will tell you when talking to the Asian Pacific-American constituents that I represent, they are concerned when their best and brightest come forward for an appointment to the Justice Department, he's being brushed aside and all the Republicans want to focus on is campaign finance. 
I think it is outrageous. Now let me tell you Bill Lann Lee has applied for a job at the Justice Department. He is not applying to be a member of a radical right wing foundation. He is applying for a job at the Justice Department. And this is what his qualifications are all about. 
If Mr. Lee were applying for a radical right wing foundation maybe the criteria the Senate Judiciary Committee is using would be appropriate, but it is not appropriate to use radical right wing foundation criteria for a nomination to the Justice Department. 
If the Republicans want to attack President Clinton, there's lots of ways to attack President Clinton. If they want to attack civil rights law then do it through the legislative process but do not attack a nominee who comes forth, who is willing to put his life aside and the practice that he's developed working with the NAACP, to serve this Nation. 
I don't know how many additional nominations President Clinton can bring to the Senate. One, because they are either stalled out or people are humiliated when they come forth, or two, there is going to be an increasing unwillingness to attract qualified nominees. 
I want Bill Lann Lee to know that I'm on his side and so are the Democratic women of the Senate. We would love to see him at the Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice. Not because he would favor some but because he would fight for the women of this country, for the people of color in this country, for the people that need civil rights advanced within the Justice Department. 
And to the people of the Asian Pacific-American community I say not to lose heart. We're so proud of Bill Lann Lee. We're so proud of what you do for America, but we're not proud at all of the Senate Republican controlled Judiciary Committee.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I rise to talk about an issue that is very important to me, very important to my constituents in Maryland and very important to the people of the United States of America. 
For the second Congress in a row, I am joining in a bipartisan effort with my friend and colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe, to end an unfair policy of the Social Security System. 
Senator Snowe and I are introducing the Social Security Family Protection Act. This bill addresses retirement security and family security. We want the middle class of this Nation to know that we are going to give help to those who practice self-help. 
What is it I am talking about? We have found that Social Security does not pay benefits for the last month of life. If a Social Security retiree dies on the 18th of the month or even on the 30th of the month, the surviving spouse or family members must send back the Social Security check for that month. 
I think that is an harsh and heartless rule. That individual worked for Social Security benefits, earned those benefits, and paid into the Social Security trust fund. The system should allow the surviving spouse or the estate of the family to use that Social Security check for the last month of life. 
This legislation has an urgency, Mr. President. When a loved one dies, there are expenses that the family must take care of. People have called my office in tears. Very often it is a son or a daughter that is grieving the death of a parent. They are clearing up the paperwork for their mom or dad, and there is the Social Security check. And they say, `Senator, the check says for the month of May. Mom died on May 28. Why do we have to send the Social Security check back? We have bills to pay. We have utility coverage that we need to wrap up, mom's rent, or her mortgage, or health expenses. Why is Social Security telling me, `Send the check back or we're going to come and get you'?' 
With all the problems in our country today, we ought to be going after drug dealers and tax dodgers, not honest people who have paid into Social Security, and not the surviving spouse or the family who have been left with the bills for the last month of their loved one's life. They are absolutely right when they call me and say that Social Security was supposed to be there for them. 
I've listened to my constituents and to the stories of their lives. What they say is this: `Senator Mikulski, we don't want anything for free. But our family does want what our parents worked for. We do want what we feel we deserve and what has been paid for in the trust fund in our loved one's name. Please make sure that our family gets the Social Security check for the last month of our life.' 
That is what our bill is going to do. That is why Senator Snowe and I are introducing the Family Social Security Protection Act. When we talk about retirement security, the most important part of that is income security. And the safety net for most Americans is Social Security. 
We know that as Senators we have to make sure that Social Security remains solvent, and we are working to do that. We also don't want to create an undue administrative burden at the Social Security Administration--a burden that might affect today's retirees. But it is absolutely crucial that we provide a Social Security check for the last month of life. 
How do we propose to do that? We have a very simple, straightforward way of dealing with this problem. Our legislation says that if you die before the 15th of the month, you will get a check for half the month. If you die after the 15th of the month, your surviving spouse or the family estate would get a check for the full month. 
We think this bill is fundamentally fair. Senator Snowe and I are old-fashioned in our belief in family values. We believe you honor your father and your mother. We believe that it is not only a good religious and moral principle, but it is good public policy as well. 
The way to honor your father and mother is to have a strong Social Security System and to make sure the system is fair in every way. That means fair for the retiree and fair for the spouse and family. That is why we support making sure that the surviving spouse or family can keep the Social Security check for the last month of life. 
Mr. President, we urge our colleagues to join us in this effort and support the Social Security Family Protection Act.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support a bill introduced by my colleagues Senators Kerry and Coats to protect workplace religious freedom. 
I have long championed the rights of individuals to freedom of religious observance and practice. I believe individual Christians, Jews, Muslims, and others should be able to honor their religious beliefs without fear of losing their jobs. 
For example, employees should be able to observe Good Friday, the Jewish Sabbath or wear clothing required by one's religion. I've met with many constituents who have expressed their concern to me that they have been discriminated against because of their religious practices. 
My State of Maryland already has many employers who are sensitive to the needs of religious accommodation. However, there is room for improvement. One Arab-American woman from my State told me she cannot wear her traditional Muslim garb at her place of employment. I know there are other stories like this which cut across all faiths. 
If an employee's religious practice does not cause an undue hardship on an employer, an employee should be given the freedom to observe or practice a religious custom. 
I am dismayed that many individuals are discriminated against in our society, because of their religious beliefs. Our country was founded on the premise that everyone has a right to religious freedom. We need to preserve this doctrine. 
Unfortunately, the courts have interpreted title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 very narrowly when it comes to religious practices. This bill would restore the basic tenet of religious freedom to thousands of individuals who have met with discrimination at the workplace. 
I urge my colleagues to support S. 1164, the Workplace Religious Freedom Restoration Act. I believe religious accommodation is a cherished right that we must protect.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that is very important to me, very important to my constituents in Maryland, and very important to government workers and retirees across the Nation. 
Today, I am introducing a bill to modify a harsh and heartless rule of government that is unfair and prevents current workers from enjoying the benefits of their hard work in their retirement. I want the middle class of this Nation to know that if you worked hard to become middle class you should stay middle class when you retire. 
Under current law, there is something called the pension offset law. This is a harsh and unfair policy. Let me tell you why. 
If you are a retired government worker, and you qualify for a spousal Social Security benefit based on your spouse's employment record, you may not receive what you qualify for. Because the pension offset law reduces or entirely eliminates a Social Security spousal benefit when the surviving spouse is eligible for a pension from a local, state, or federal government job that was not covered by Social Security. 
This policy only applies to government workers, not private sector workers. Let me give you an example of two women, Helen and her sister Phyllis. 
Helen is a retired Social Security benefits counselor who lives in Woodlawn, MD. Helen currently earns $600 a month from her Federal Government pension. She's also entitled to a $645 a month spousal benefit from Social Security based on her deceased husband's hard work as an auto mechanic. That's a combined monthly benefit of $1,245. 
Phyllis is a retired bank teller also in Woodlawn, MD. She currently earns a pension of $600 a month from the bank. Like Helen, Phyllis is also entitled to a $645 a month spousal benefit from Social Security based on her husband's employment. He was an auto mechanic, too. In fact, he worked at the same shop as Helen's husband. 
So, Phyllis is entitled to a total of $1,245 a month, the same as Helen. But, because of the pension offset law, Helen's spousal benefit is reduced by two-thirds of her government pension, or $400. So instead of $1,245 per month, she will only receive $845 per month. 
This reduction in benefits only happens to Helen because she worked for the government. Phyllis will receive her full benefits because her pension is a private sector pension. I don't think that's right, and that's why I'm introducing this legislation. 
The crucial thing about the Mikulski modification is that it guarantees a minimum benefit of $1,200. So, with the Mikulski modification to the pension offset, Helen is guaranteed at least $1,200 per month. 
Let me tell you how it works. Helen's spousal benefit will be reduced only by two-thirds of the amount her combined monthly benefit exceeds $1,200. In her case, the amount of the offset would be two thirds of $45, or $30. That's a big difference from $400, and I think people like our Federal workers, teachers, and our firefighters deserve that big difference. 
Why should earning a government pension penalize the surviving spouse? If a deceased spouse had a job covered by Social Security and paid into the Social Security system. That spouse expected his earned Social Security benefits would be there for his surviving spouse. 
Most working men believe this and many working women are counting on their spousal benefits. But because of this harsh and heartless policy the spousal benefits will not be there, your spouse will not benefit from your hard work, and, chances are, you won't find out about it until your loved one is gone and you really need the money. 
The Mikulski modification guarantees that the spouse will at least receive $1,200 in combined benefits. That Helen will receive the same amount as Phyllis. 
I'm introducing this legislation, because these survivors deserve better than the reduced monthly benefits that the pension offset currently allows. They deserve to be rewarded for their hard work, not penalized for it. 
Many workers affected by this offset policy are women, or clerical workers and bus drivers who are currently working and looking forward to a deserved retirement. These are people who worked hard as Federal employees, school teachers, or firefighters. 
Frankly, I would repeal this policy all together. But, I realize that budget considerations make that unlikely. As a compromise, I hope we can agree that retirees who work hard should not have this offset applied until their combined monthly benefit exceeds $1,200. 
In the few cases where retirees might have their benefits reduced by this policy change, my legislation will calculate their pension offset by the current method. I also have a provision in this legislation to index the minimum amount of $1,200 to inflation so retirees will see their minimum benefits increase as the cost of living increases. 
I believe that people who work hard and play by the rules should not be penalized by arcane, legislative technicalities. That's why I'm introducing this bill today. 
Representative William Jefferson of Louisiana has introduced similar legislation in the House. I look forward to working with him to modify the harsh pension offset rule. 
If the Federal Government is going to force government workers and retirees in Maryland and across the country to give up a portion of their spousal benefits, the retirees should at least receive a fair portion of their benefits. 
I want to urge my Senate colleagues to join me in this effort and support my legislation to modify the Government pension offset.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I rise today to join my very distinguished colleague, the Senator from Missouri, to offer for the Senate's consideration the conference agreement on the VA-HUD bill. 
This bill contains $99 billion--$99 billion--in outlay spending, of which almost $20 billion is in mandatory spending. This isn't just about numbers though. And it will not be about statistics; this is about people. 
The VA-HUD bill is probably one of the most complex that comes before the Senate. In terms of dollar amounts, it ranks up there with defense, and it ranks up there with the Labor, Health and Human Services budget. What it does in terms of dollar amounts, though, is it really is focused on two policy objectives. No. 1, how do we respond to the day-to-day needs of our constituents, those veterans who need health care or access to a mortgage, or constituents who need housing, whether it is housing for the elderly, or housing for neighborhoods trying to rebuild themselves, or in response to the need for emergency assistance? 
At the same time, this subcommittee gets America ready for its future. It is significant in public investments in science and technology. That is where we have tried to make wise and prudent choices, on how we respond to the day-to-day needs of the American people and at the same time help our country get ready for the future. I believe that, working on a bipartisan basis, we have been able to do this. 
I thank my colleague, Senator Bond, for the collegial manner in which he and his staff have worked with my staff and myself to craft a bipartisan bill that represents the best interests of the American people. 
I am very pleased to say that when it has come to meeting the health needs of our veterans, whether it has been making sure that the housing needs are met, and at the same time whether it is our space program or our investments in information technology, we have not played politics. 
Isn't this what the American people want us to do? For the people who risked their lives at Iwo Jima, Pork Chop Hill, Desert Storm, the Mekong delta, they want us to get out there and get up every day and see how we can be responsible in meeting their needs and not play politics with their needs. Well, we looked at people who need public housing or subsidized housing, how we can ensure that housing is not a way of life but a way to a better life. Isn't that what the American people want us to do? 
When they look to not only the Stars and Stripes, but they look out there to the stars of the universe, they want the United States of America to lead the way. They do not want us to play politics with our space program. And we have not done that. 
At the same time, they know a new century is coming, a new economy is on its way. We need groups like the National Science Foundation, in its investments in information technology and other basic scientific research, to do that basic research which the Federal laboratories and our universities are best at, so that we can then turn to the private sector to value add where public investments in publicly funded research will lead to the private-sector jobs. And they do not want us to play politics with that. And guess what? We did not. 
So, Mr. President, as we come before you with this VA-HUD bill, I think that is what we have done. We have moved this legislation forward. I think the numbers speak for themselves. 
We have provided $300 million more for VA medical care than the budget agreement because we said, `Promises made should be promises kept to our veterans.' 
We wanted to be sure that the VA medical research could continue to be funded in a way that meets the important practical clinical research that is important. I am so pleased that we are going to be doing research on gulf war syndrome. I am particularly pleased that we have the set-aside for both Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer. With quality VA medical care and research, we are providing real help for real people. 
When we look at our housing and urban development, we once again make sure that we adequately fund the very successful program that funds housing for the elderly in our local communities. 
This committee was concerned, though, about two things. First, we were concerned that the way section 8 was being funded could inadvertently result in yet one more unfunded liability to taxpayers and a hollow opportunity for the poor. The Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond, has been an architect of reform in this area. I have noted with great pleasure the way he worked with the administration in terms of fashioning a compromise where we meet our fiscal and social responsibility simultaneously. 
We also fund something called HOPE VI which says that public housing should not be a way of life but a way to a better life. We have come up with not only a new physical infrastructure, but a new social infrastructure that says, if you get a subsidy, you have to get yourself, your family, and your community ready for the future because it mandates that you must be in job training and it mandates also that you must be engaged in community service in your own area. 
This way we build the capacity of the individual, we build the community in which that individual lives, and we get value not only for the taxpayer, but the lives of residents will be transformed forever. 
Again, this committee provided real help for real people. This year, when we looked at the environment, the President's request had many items we worked on, from Superfund to Brownfields, clean air to clean water. What we have been able to do is not only work on these issues, but also lay the groundwork for the research that needs to be done to be sure that we have sufficient science 
for a regulatory framework. 
I am very grateful for the response of the Senator from Missouri when I came to him when Maryland was hit by a terrible tragedy in which we had a fish kill over on our Eastern Shore. We had thousands of fish die. Our great medical community was concerned that it was having a dire effect on the physical and public health of our community. 
Before we responded inappropriately, we felt that we needed to have our Federal laboratories engaged so that they could support not only Maryland, but other affected States like Virginia and North Carolina, so we could come up with wise solutions to protect public health and also maintain the community. 
I want to thank Senator Bond for responding to my request for $3 million that will fund EPA to find a solution to a problem called the pfiesteria, an `X Files'-like organism that goes from a vegetable to an animal and then attacks fish in a vicious way. 
What we are able to do now is to provide the best science to come up with the best solutions to be able to protect lives, protect the Chesapeake Bay, and protect our economy. I want to thank the Senator for responding to that because it was a last-minute, but certainly a much needed request. 
In NASA, we also talked about how we maintain our core programs--safety for the shuttle, we will fly high in the space station, and we will once again have adequate funding for Mission to Planet Earth. While we study the great universe, we also need to look back on the one planet where we do believe there is intelligent life, and that is our own dear planet Earth. Thanks to this we will be able to study our planet as if it were a distant planet and come up with new ways of doing business, where we can predict earthquakes, where we can predict floods, where we can predict famine, and using the tools of science, we can help countries all over this planet be able to protect themselves from either the dire effects of nature or the dire effects that we bring upon ourselves. 
I am also particularly pleased that, once again, the chairman responded to a request from both the administration and from this side of the aisle to maintain the National Service Program. This is a program where we ask young people to volunteer in their communities, and while they are doing that, receive a voucher to reduce their student debts, and at the same time give back to their community. 
There are many aspects of this bill which we could elaborate on, but the one that we probably have to respond to most immediately is the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA is the 9-1-1 agency for the American people. Unfortunately, just about every Senator's State had a call on FEMA. We were able to respond to that, and once again, we worked on a bipartisan basis. What we are also going to do now is to practice the three R's of emergency management: readiness and preparedness, response when a disaster hits, and restoration. Only this time when we restore, we are not going to only restore, we will take steps to help communities reduce the impact from future natural disasters like hurricanes and floods. 
Mr. President, we could talk about the legislation, but what I am here to say today is that what we have done in this subcommittee is that we have responded to the needs of the American people, we have gotten ourselves ready for the future, we have been fiscally responsible, and we have done it on a bipartisan basis. At the end of the day, I don't think we can do better than that. I will be able to go back to my constituents in Maryland and say, `We think we have done a good job for you. We think we have done a good job for America.' 
I thank Senator Bond and his staff for the way they worked with us, particularly John Kamarck, Carrie Apostolou, and a wonderful detailee, Sarah Horrigan. I also want to thank my staff, Andy Givens, David Bowers, and also another detailee, a science whiz kid like Sarah, Stacy Closson, who came to us to learn about how the Senate works, while we have a better insight into how science works. 
Mr. President, I think that concludes my remarks. I yield the floor and I will look forward to the passage of the bill.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, now that we have concluded our bill, I too want to express my appreciation to Senator Bond and his very able staff--I am sorry Sarah Horrigan is not with us, her able cooperation--and, to my own staff, Andy Givens, David Bowers, and Stacy Closson. 
I wish all bills could move as quickly and as rigorously and thoroughly as ours did. I yield the floor.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, thank you. 
Mr. President, in a few hours we will be voting on the final passage of the FDA Modernization and Accountability Act. 
I am so pleased that this day has finally arrived. I thank the chairman of the Labor Committee, Mr. Jeffords, for all of his incredible patience, persistence, dedication, and attention to really lead the mission to move FDA into the 21st century. I thank him for his heartfelt devotion to accomplishing this mission and for never giving up. I also want to thank his staff for their hard work and for the bipartisan, nonpartisan way in which they worked. 
Let me also acknowledge the tremendous contribution of the ranking member, Senator Kennedy. There is no doubt that this is a better bill and FDA will be in better shape because of his efforts. 
Mr. President, I have worked on FDA reform for a number of years. When I was a Member of the House of Representatives, we embarked, on a bipartisan basis, to ensure consumer protection, to prevent dumping of drugs that did not meet our standards into Third World countries. 
Then coming to the Senate, I joined with my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and with the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, in fashioning something called the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, otherwise nicknamed PDUFA. What PDUFA did is provide, through a user fee mechanism, the ability to hire 600 more people at FDA to analyze the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals to move them to the marketplace. 
Because of PDUFA and the great legislative idea of 
Kennedy-Hatch, FDA was able to hire more people to examine products that were being presented for evaluation and get them to clinical practice more quickly. 
The leadership of Kennedy-Hatch on PDUFA has not only stood the test of time, but it has shown that we can expedite the drug approval process while maintaining safety and efficacy. 
But while PDUFA made a huge difference, it became clear that PDUFA was not enough. More staff operating in an outdated regulatory framework without a clear legislative framework was deficient. 
That is when we began to consult with experts in the field of public health, particularly those involved in drugs and biologics on where we needed to go. While we were considering this, the world of science was changing. We were experiencing a tremendous revolution in biology. We went from basic discoveries in science, particularly in the field of chemistry and physics, to a whole new explosion in biology and genetics and biologic materials. We also went from a smokestack economy to a cyberspace economy in which the very tools of information technology could enable us to improve our productivity. 
It became clear that we needed an FDA with a new legislative framework and a new culture and a continued commitment to the traditional values of safety and efficacy. This is when we began to put together what we called the sensible center on FDA reform. One often hears about partisan bickering. One often hears about prickly relationships between the two parties. But I tell you, thanks to the leadership of Senator Kassebaum, who initially chaired this initiative, we, Republicans and Democrats, worked together because we never wanted to play politics with the lives of the American people. What we wanted to do is to make sure the American medical community and the world medical community had the best clinical tools at their disposal to help save lives. 
We saw the reform of FDA accomplishing two important policy goals--saving lives and at the same time generating jobs in our own American economy in the fields of pharmaceuticals, biologics, and medical devices. 
Senator Kassebaum took important steps forward. Senator Jeffords assumed that mantle and brought us to this point today. 
What will this bill do? Why is it so important? It gives, first of all, a clear statement on what is the mission and purpose of FDA--to save lives with pharmaceutical and biologic products and to maintain the safety of our food supply. This bill does not deal with the food safety issue, but it sure does focus on those things that normally would take place in clinical practice. 
Why is it so important? It streamlines the regulatory process, it reauthorizes that very highly successful PDUFA, to make sure we have adequate staff, and it creates an FDA that rewards significant science while protecting public health. 
It means that new lifesaving drugs and devices will get into clinical practice more quickly. It will enable us to produce products that we can sell around the world saving lives and generating jobs. 
What is so great about pharmaceuticals, biologics, and medical devices is that they are translingual, they are transcultural. When you need a new drug and it is approved by FDA, whether you live in Baltimore or whether you live in London or whether you live in Bangladesh, you need it. If you then use a medical device, you know if it is safe in Maryland, it will be safe in Moscow or Malaysia. This is why this will offer us a whole new opportunity in exports. 
I am really proud of FDA. I am proud of all the people who work at FDA, and under very Spartan resources. Why? Because it is known as the gold standard around the world for product approval. We want to maintain that high standard, and at the same time we want to make sure that the FDA is ready to enter the 21st century. 
This legislation will be the bridge to the future, maintaining the evaluation of safety and efficacy with the new tools to be able to participate in a 21st century science environment and a 21st 
century economy. This bill sets up a new legislative and regulatory framework which reflects the latest scientific advancements. That framework continues the FDA's strong mission to public health and safety, but it sets a new goal for FDA--enhancing public health by not impeding innovation or product liability through unnecessary red tape that only delays approval. 
There is an urgency about reauthorizing PDUFA. Its authority expires at the end of this month. PDUFA has enabled FDA to hire 600 new reviewers, and to cut review times from 29 to 17 months over the last 5 years. If we fail to act now, it means the people who have been working on behalf of the American people and the world will get RIF notices. We cannot let them down, because we do not want them to let the American people or the world down. We risk losing talented employees and slowing down the approval process. 
Delay will hurt dedicated employees, but more importantly it will hurt patients. Patients benefit the most from this legislation. Safe and effective new medical tools will be helping patients live longer lives or get better quicker. 
We are not just extending PDUFA. We are improving it. Currently, PDUFA only addresses something called the review phase of the approval process. Our bill extends PDUFA to streamline the early drug development phase as well. 
What does this mean? New innovations. We are going to be able to allow for electronic submissions. We want to improve productivity. Instead of carloads of paper, stacks and stacks of material not being able to be utilized in an efficient way being deposited at FDA, companies will be able to make those electronic submissions. This reduces not only paperwork but actually provides a more agile way for scientific reviewers to get through the data in a way that improves efficiency while they are analyzing efficacy. 
Updating the approval process for biotechnology is another critical component of this bill. Biotechnology is one of the fastest growing industries in our country. In my own State of Maryland, there are 143 of these companies. They are working on everything from AIDS to Alzheimer's to Parkinson's disease, to breast and ovarian cancer, as well as new immunizations for children. 
These are absolutely vital areas of endeavor. We want to be able to help them develop these new areas, go through a submission at FDA to make sure they are safe, and get new products out there doing their job of improving people's health. 
The job of FDA is to make sure that safe and effective products get to our patients. Our job, as Members of Congress, is to fund scientific research through NIH and other Federal laboratories and extramural research at great institutions like the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins and at the same time to provide FDA the regulatory and legislative framework to evaluate new products to make them available to doctors and to patients. 
That is why I am fighting for this. There have been many issues raised in this debate. Some have been very robust. Some have even been prickly. But I tell you, I want to absolutely say that I am on the side of FDA. I am absolutely on the side of safety. I am absolutely on the side of efficacy. I believe this is what this bill does. 
This legislation should not be a battle of wills, it should not be a battle over this line item or that line item. It should be really a battle over what is the best way to make sure the American people have from their physicians and other clinical practitioners the best devices and products to be able to save their lives. 
Mr. President, my dear father died of Alzheimer's. He was in the final stages when I became a U.S. Senator. He was so ill that he could not come to that marvelous night in my life when I won the general election and knew I would be the first Democratic woman ever elected in her own right. I spoke to my father that election night, via TV because he could not be there, to thank him for what he did for me and my sisters. With Alzheimer's, I watched my father die one brain cell at a time. It did not matter that I was a U.S. Senator, it did not matter that I was helping fund research at NIH, my father was dying. 
My father was a modest man. He didn't want a fancy tombstone or a lot of other things, but I vowed, I promised, in my heart of hearts I would do all I could to find a cure for Alzheimer's. I would do all I could for those people who have Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia or other mind diseases. While I did that, I promised also that I would do all I could to make sure those tools moved to the clinical practice as fast as they could. 
Every one of us has faced some type of tragedy in our lives where we look to the American medical, pharmaceutical, biological, and device communities to help us. I have done that so many times. I am grateful to the medical communities in the United States of America. 
When my own mother had one of her last horrible heart attacks that was rapidly leading to a stroke there was a new drug that was so sophisticated that if it was administered quickly could help her avoid having a stroke. It required informed consent, because even though it was approved it was so dramatic in the way it thins the blood, almost to a hemophilia level, that you needed consent on the scene. 
I heard all of the medical pros and cons of that. I was advised by a great clinician at Mercy Hospital and I gave that approval because my mother was not conscious and not able to do that. And guess what? That new drug approved by FDA, developed in San Francisco, got my mother through her critical medical crisis with the hands-on care of the Sisters of Mercy at Mercy Hospital. My mother did not have a stroke because we avoided the clotting with the help of this new dramatic drug. 
I give praise and thanksgiving to God for that and the ingenuity of the American medical community that enabled my mother to stay with us 100 more days so she could be back at home, have conversations with us, her grandchildren, and so she could, even in her final days, continue a telephone ministry that she had. She was a member of a parish group called the Cheer Up Club where other shut-ins called each other. Let me tell you, the best `Cheer Up Club' I can belong to is right here in the U.S. Senate when we pass FDA reform to make sure that when a physician works with a patient or a family they are cheered because they have these new tools. 
Mr. President, I thank you for the time given to me to speak today. If I seem a little emotional, you bet. I love my family, as so many of us do, and this is why I so rely upon the American medical community and FDA to make sure that the best pharmaceutical, biological, and medical devices are available to the American people and also to the people of the world. 
I look forward to voting for final passage and having a conference report to bring back.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. Chairman, I agree completely with what you just stated. The provisions that have been negotiated between FDA and industry and set forth in the sideletter from the Secretary are a key part of PDUFA. These provisions cover electronic submissions, meeting management goals, clinical holds, major dispute resolution, special protocol question assessment and agreement, and additional procedures, such as action letters. 
Not only should these performance goals be considered fully binding on the agency, they should be considered as minimum, not maximum commitments. If the agency can do better, it should. I know that FDA will do its best to exceed the performance goals and other matters spelled out in the letter, just as it has exceeded its commitments in the 1992 PDUFA letter.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor Senator Harkin's amendment to establish the Center of Alternative Medicine. I helped him establish the Office of Alternative Medicine in 1993 at NIH. Why did I do that? One, because I want everyone who is sick in the United States of America to have access to all possible means of treatment that are safe and have efficacy. At the same time, I wanted to prevent quackery. I also was aware of the Harvard study by a Dr. Eisenberg that said one out of three Americans was using alternative or complementary medicine, but we were not aware of scientific investigation to establish its efficacy or its safety. Yet, many of us have enjoyed those practices. 
Some years ago, I had some very severe illnesses. Western medicine was of limited utility for me and I turned to acupuncture. Acupuncture helped me get well and has helped me stay well. I am pleased about that. But there are many other modalities out there being utilized by the American consumer. I want to make sure they are safe. I want to make sure they have efficacy. I want NIH to investigate it, and then I want them to validate it. I believe there is merit in this. 
I am puzzled why NIH wants to continually try to submerge this Office of Alternative or Complementary Medicine. The hallmark of NIH is to have an open mind and to pursue scientific investigation. I believe Senator Harkin is on the right track. Though this amendment might not be germane, it is certainly relevant to the 
American people. If we don't find a way to move it on this bill, let's explore other ways. 
I yield back such time as I might have.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today to recognize the 25th Anniversary of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences [USUHS]. Over the past 25 years, USUHS has provided an invaluable service to our Armed Forces and to our Nation. 
The founders of USUHS wanted to create a medical school to produce physicians who would remain on active duty for a full career, ensuring the continuity of lessons learned in the practice of uniformed medicine. This concept has made USUHS a unique institution which enables doctors to target their skills to meet the changing demands of the modern battlefield. 
USUHS is essential to our military mission because it ensures readiness. Readiness doesn't just mean supplying our troops with the best equipment and training. It also means that we are ready to provide the best possible medical care in the worst possible situations. If we send our military to battle without skilled and experienced medical professionals--we are sending them out unarmed. 
This concept for medical training was a success during recent conflicts. During Operation Desert Storm, USUHS physicians were immediately deployable to combat areas and utilized their training in military combat, unconventional warfare, and preventive medicine. This saved countless lives during the gulf war and will keep our troops safe in any future military conflict. 
I am proud of USUHS's accomplishments. I hope they will continue serving our armed services by keeping them safe and healthy well into the 21st century.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Ashcroft amendment. This amendment would eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts [NEA], an organization which has come under unfair attack in the past few years. 
Funding for the NEA has consistently dropped. Funding last year was $99.5 million, a 39-percent decrease in 2 years. Now, many of my colleagues want to abolish the endowment completely. I disagree with this approach. 
For every Federal dollar invested in the arts, our citizens receive an enormous return. My state of Maryland received $1.4 million in arts funding last year. This means that the Baltimore Childrens Theater Association is able to thrive. It means that the Baltimore Museum of Art can bring world renown exhibits to the citizens of my State. And it means that local communities throughout Maryland have access to community festivals, arts centers, and galleries. 
There is a myth that the arts are for the elite. However, I believe the arts are about three things: Jobs, economic development, and families. The arts attract jobs. The arts help create economic development in communities. The arts are family first. 
The cost of Federal funding for the arts is 35 cents for every citizen. The arts are a sound investment. The rewards are great. 
Federal funding for the NEA has led to the flourishing of arts organizations in small cities and rural areas across the country. In my State of Maryland, local arts agencies are able to leverage Federal dollars for their fundraising efforts. 
Without Federal support, Marylanders wouldn't have the Puppet Co. in Glen Echo, the Bluebird Blues Festival at Prince George's Community College, the Writers Center in Bethesda, or the University of Maryland music programs. 
I am committed to protecting the Federal role in the arts. We should not become the only civilized country in the world that does not support the arts. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the Ashcroft amendment.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in a week already saddened by the loss of Diana, Princess of Wales, we were further grieved to learn Friday of the death of Mother Teresa. Her presence, that of a living saint, will be sorely missed. 
Mother Teresa has played the role of world conscience. Throughout her life, she has lived in the most pure and basic manner. While caring for the destitute and sick, she insisted on living in poverty herself. Mother Teresa believed that `the more we empty ourselves, the more room we give God to fill us.' She practiced what she preached. 
Mother Teresa's remarkable and selfless works have been recognized around the world. In 1979, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1980, she was bestowed India's highest honor, the Jewel of India award. Last year, President Clinton conferred honorary American citizenship on Mother Teresa. Most recently, she was awarded a congressional Medal of Honor. Mother Teresa knew that these were merely earthly rewards. 
While she was an international figure, she remained focused and committed to her mission. She rejected the media attention these awards drew, saying that she must get back to her work. Any money that came with these awards was immediately given to the poor. 
Mother Teresa will be sadly missed but her work will continue. I pray that Sister Nirmala will be given the same strength and world support to continue the mission Mother Teresa founded in 1948, the Order of the Missionaries of Charity. I also pay tribute to Mother Teresa's life by recommiting myself to work for the poorest members of society. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his leadership in bringing about not only a reform structure for FDA that preserves both the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals, biologics and other products that the American people utilize, but also for the fact that he has been able to move this legislation to the floor. 
I also extend my compliments to Senator Kennedy for his longstanding commitment to public health, to public safety, and at the same time being able to maintain the whole idea of developing jobs in our own country. 
Mr. President, I have been working on FDA reform for a number of years. I worked on FDA reform when I was a Member of the House of Representatives on the Energy and Commerce Committee, serving under then Congressman Dingell, where we embarked, on a bipartisan basis, to ensure consumer protection and that we did not dump our drugs that did not meet our standards on third world countries. 
Coming to the Senate, I joined with my colleague from Massachusetts and the Senator from Utah, [Mr. Hatch], in fashioning legislation called PDUFA, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which enabled a very important tool to go into place in which we could hire more people to come to FDA to examine the products that were being presented for evaluation, to be able to move them to clinical practice in an expeditious way. The leadership of Kennedy-Hatch on PDUFA has not only stood the test of time, but has really been shown as a test for being able to expedite approval processes and maintaining safety and efficacy. 
But it was clear that PDUFA was not enough, that more staff operating in an outdated regulatory framework, without a clear legislative framework, was deficient. That is when we began to consult with experts in public health, those involved in public policy related to food, particularly with drugs and biologics. And in the meantime, while we were considering all this, something came into the world which was the revolution in biology. We had gone from a smokestack economy to a cyberspace economy. We had gone through basic discoveries in science from the field of chemistry and physics to a whole new explosion in biology, which is truly revolutionizing the world, whether it is in genetics or other biologic materials. These offer new challenges to ensure their safety and efficacy, new staff and a new legislative framework. 
What we then said is that we needed an FDA with a new legislative framework and a new culture. This is then when we tried to put together what we called the sensible center, working with Republicans and Democrats alike, because we certainly never want to play politics with the lives of the American people to come up with it. 
Senator Kassebaum chaired the committee during this initiative. We took important steps forward. I say to Senator Jeffords, you have assumed that mantle, and I think you have improved on the original legislation that Senator Kassebaum had written. 
I was proud to participate for several reasons. 
One, I have the pleasure and the honor of having FDA located in Maryland. I cannot tell you the enthusiasm to be able to have the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda and FDA in Rockville, really looking at the life science endeavors, the ingenuity, creativity and scientific know-how, to come up with basic knowledge, to work extramurally in these wonderful institutions in Maryland, in Massachusetts, and Vermont, academic centers of excellence, to come up with fantastic new ways of saving lives and at the same time generating jobs. 
Through the work, then, of Secretary Shalala and the Vice President, we did make some improvements. But we must codify those improvements. So this is where we come to today. What I like about the legislation here is that it streamlines and updates the regulatory process for new products, it reauthorized that highly successful Prescription Drug User Fee Act, and it creates an FDA that rewards significant science and evaluation while protecting public health. 
Now, what is the end result of the legislation that we will pass? It will mean that new life-saving drugs and devices will get into clinical practice more quickly, and it will enable us to add products that we can sell around the world and, through this, save lives and generate jobs. 
FDA is known the world over as kind of the `gold standard' of the approval of products. We want to maintain that high standard. We want to maintain its global position. At the same time, we want to make sure that FDA can enter the 21st century. This bill gets us there. It sets up a new legislative and regulatory framework that reflects the latest scientific advancements. The framework continues FDA's strong mission to protect public health and safety and at the same time sets a new goal for FDA, enhancing public health by not impeding innovation or product availability through unnecessary processes that only delay the approval. 
We are considering a very important issue today. I would just like to reiterate the importance that no matter what the outcome of this bill, we must pass the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. This has enabled them to hire 600 new reviewers and cut review times from 29 to 17 months over the last 5 years. If we fail to act, it means that people who have been working on behalf of the American people will get RIF notices because we have not been as quick to approve FDA reform as we have asked them to approve products that do meet the safety standard. 
Who benefits from this legislation? Most of all, it is the patients. Safe and effective new medicines will be getting to the patients early. It will meet the performance standards in PDUFA, and we will be able to again provide this great opportunity for patients. 
By extending PDUFA, we can make further improvements in the drug approval process. Currently, PDUFA only addresses the review phase of the approval process. Our bill expands PDUFA to streamline the early drug development phase as well. This expansion will be covered in a separate letter. This letter is very significant in how PDUFA will work. The letter includes performance goals that have been worked out between FDA and the biological and pharmaceutical industry. 
What are the kinds of things that this will do that will help? Electronic submissions. It means that instead of a carload, whether it is UPS, IPS, or whatever, pulling up at FDA, with stacks and stacks and stacks of material, it can be done electronically. That not only reduces paperwork, but actually provides a more facile, agile way for the scientific reviewers to get through the data. Also, we are talking about meeting management, in other words, FDA meeting to discuss what are the appropriate 
protocols; reducing the response time on clinical holds; having written protocol agreements; predictable appeal processes; and reducing manufacturing supplement review times, along with some others. 
These are management tools, and I cannot understand why the naysayers are saying no to this. 
I want to make it clear that these goals that we are outlining should be binding on the agency. It is my intent that the letter that will accompany this legislation should be considered as a minimum, not a maximum, commitment. The agency can do better; it should by all means do better. The agency did a great job exceeding its commitments in the 1992 letter along PDUFA compliance. I am sure they can do it this time. 
Updating the approval process for biotech is another critical component. Biotech is one of the fastest growing industries in our country. There are over 143 biotech companies like that in my own State of Maryland. They are working on AIDS, Alzheimer's, breast and ovarian cancer, other life-threatening infections such as whooping cough. 
I know during the NIH discussion the other day we passed additional money for Parkinson's. I am proud to report that there is a biotech firm in Maryland that also has a joint venture with brilliant neurological scientists from Johns Hopkins. And we anticipate either a cure for Parkinson's--a cure for Parkinson's--or certainly the ability to stretch out the ability of people to function both intellectually and in terms of their motor skills. 
You know what? That cure could very well come from Maryland. My gosh, can you understand the joy that I will have the day that I can come to the U.S. Senate and announce that we have found a cure for Parkinson's, that it is in my own home State, and that we have a pharmaceutical that can help people gripped by this devastating and debilitating disease? 
That is what we are here for. We do not find the cure, but we fund the research to look for the cure. We do not invent the product; that is up to the genius of our private sector working with our scientific community. We cannot ensure the safety and efficacy of that idea to make sure it is not only a dream, but also has the ability to really work in clinical practice in a way that enhances in patients. And that is the job of FDA. But our job is to fund the research and to have the regulatory and legislative framework to evaluate it, to get it out to clinical practice. That is why I am fighting for this. This is exactly why I am fighting for this. 
My dear father died of Alzheimer's, and it did not matter that I was a U.S. Senator. I watched my father die one brain cell at a time, and it did not matter what my job was. My father was a modest man. He did not want a fancy tombstone or a lot of other things, but I vowed I would do all I can for research in this and to help other people along these lines. And we can go around the Senate. Every one of us has faced some type of tragedy in our lives where we looked to the American medical and pharmaceutical, biological community to help us. 
When my mother had one of her last terrible heart attacks that was leading rapidly to a stroke--there is a new drug that is so sophisticated that it must be administered very quickly. You need informed consent because, even though it is approved, it is so dramatic that it thins the blood almost to the hemophilia level. I gave that approval because my mother was not conscious enough to do it. 
Guess what? That new drug approved by FDA, developed in San Francisco, got my mother through her medical crisis with the hands-on care of the Sisters of Mercy in Baltimore at Mercy Hospital. We were able to move that through. Mother did not have a stroke because we could avoid the clotting that would have precipitated it. 
Thanks to the grace of God and the ingenuity of American medicine, we had my mother with us 100 more days in a way that she could function at home, have conversations with us and her grandchildren. 
Do you think I am not for FDA? You think I am not for safety? You think I am not for efficacy? You bet I am. And that is what this is all about. It is not a battle of wills. It is not a battle over this line item or that line item. It is really a battle to make sure that the American people have from their physicians and clinical practitioners the best devices and products to be able to administer to save lives. 
So that is what we are all about. I do really hope that we can approve this FDA reform. I am glad that we invoked cloture, not because I want to stifle debate, but I hope that for whatever ways can be done to improve the bill, let us offer those amendments on the floor, let us have a robust debate, and then let us vote on this, because at the end of next week we will make sure we have had adequate staff to be able to deal with work at FDA and an adequate framework to save lives and generate jobs. 
So, Mr. President, I thank you for the time. If I seem a little emotional about it, you bet I am. I love FDA. I am really proud they are in my State. I thank God for the ingenuity of the American medical community. And I really look forward to moving the bill. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much. 
I wish to say to my colleagues, we have worked very long and hard to move FDA reform ahead, to make sure that products, whether they be pharmaceuticals, biologics, or cosmetics, are available in a safe way to the American people. There are policy differences, but they should be decided on the basis of debates and votes. We should not hold up reform on the basis of process. 
Let us vote for cloture. Let us move the bill forward. Let us resolve our differences in the usual and customary way. I ask my colleagues to join with me to vote for cloture, and then move forward in an adequate, robust and well-amplified debate on the issues. 
I thank the Senator from Indiana.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as the dean of the women in the Senate, I rise to pay tribute to the life and legacy of Diana, the Princess of Wales. Our hearts go out to her family and to the British people. We believe it is appropriate that we adopt this resolution to create a national day of mourning on September 6, the day of her funeral. 
People have expressed surprise at the outpouring of love and grief from the British people. But we shouldn't be surprised. Princess Diana was a remarkable person. We were dazzled by her grace and beauty--but what we truly valued was her compassion. 
She was called the people's princess. She was born a member of the aristocracy and married into royalty--but she never forgot that Britain's strength was its ordinary working people. The thousands of people laying flowers and waiting in line for hours to sign the condolence book represent a cross section of Britons. They are the senior citizens, the working mothers, the new immigrants--and especially, the children. 
She treated the people she met with respect and compassion and she taught her children to do the same. Many people go through the motions of doing good works. But with Princess Diana, it came from the heart. 
The Princess of Wales had her personal challenges. But it is for her public commitments that we will most remember her. She chose her causes carefully. She worked on behalf of those who were most in need. She campaigned for awareness of AIDS and tolerance and compassion for those who suffered from AIDS. She helped support battered women's shelters. She worked on behalf of children's hospitals. She worked to raise money for breast cancer research. These causes were universal in nature and supported by many women around the world. 
She was also a leader in the effort to end the use of antipersonnel landmines. She traveled to Angola and Bosnia to show the world the tragic effects of landmines on ordinary civilians. By visiting mine fields and landmine victims, she showed us more than any report or international symposium ever could. 
In the U.S. Senate, Senator Leahy and Senator Hagel have led our effort to end the use of landmines. I am proud to be part of that effort. We have stopped exporting mines, and are now trying to stop their use. The world's most technologically advanced military does not need a weapon that cannot distinguish between a soldier and a child--who may be killed while playing in a field 10 years after the war is over. 
Mr. President, Princess Diana's death was a tragedy. But her life was a triumph. Her legacy is her work on behalf of those in need, and, most importantly, her children--whose lives will reflect the values their mother taught them. We can best honor her legacy by continuing to work as she did for those who are most in need.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to support the conference reports on the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act. Together, these bills will bring us to a balanced budget by the year 2002, while providing vitally important investments in education, in children's health, and in economic development. 
I believe that my job as the Senator from Maryland and the Senator for Maryland is to save jobs, save lives, and save communities. I believe these bills will help us to do all three. 
These bills address the day-to-day needs of America's families, and they keep faith with America's seniors. They open the doors to opportunity and give help to those who practice self help. 
Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that the conferees rejected the unnecessary and harmful structural changes in the Medicare Program. As my colleagues know, I adamantly opposed the means testing of the Medicare program, and the change in the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 67. Such major changes should not be considered without Presidential leadership and a national discussion. I am pleased that these changes were not included in the final budget package. I believe the commission established by this agreement is a better way of addressing the long-term solvency concerns of Medicare. 
There is much good news for senior citizens in the Medicare portions of this budget. We have ensured the solvency of the Medicare Program for at least the next 10 years. We have provided funds for critical new preventive care benefits, by expanding coverage for mammography and colerectal screening, and by improving self-management of diseases like diabetes. These are investments that will pay off, improving the health of Medicare beneficiaries and saving lives. 
Having said that, however, I am disappointed with other cuts that these bills make in the Medicare Program. It is disturbing that the Federal guarantee of adequate reimbursement rates to nursing homes has been abandoned. I believe this will put nursing homes in a budget squeeze and will have a negative effect on the quality of care that we provide to our most fragile elderly. I am also disappointed with the excessive cuts in the reimbursement rates for such key services as home oxygen therapy. I believe seniors will be hurt by this change. I hope that we will have an opportunity to revisit these issues in the future. 
This legislation also will provide a tremendous investment in the health of America's children. The $24 billion provided for health care for uninsured children in this bill is the single largest increase for children's health efforts in over 30 years. 
Mr. President, there are 10 million uninsured children in this country; 1 in 8 of the children in my own State of Maryland have no health insurance coverage. It is really shameful that we have allowed so many children to be at risk. 
I believe we have to do all we can to ensure that no child goes without adequate health care. I wish we could have reached every uninsured child with this bill. I pledge to do all I can to work toward that goal. While it does not reach 100 percent coverage for our children, I do believe that this bill makes tremendous strides in the right direction. 
Over 5 million children who currently have no health care will now get their immunizations, early screening, and other health care services. We have taken a great step in ensuring healthy children who are ready to learn and ready to succeed. 
I like this budget package because it also opens the doors to education for young people and to people seeking to further their education. The $1,500 HOPE scholarship contained in this bill will help to make available to every student the first two years of college. The tuition tax credit the bill provides for juniors, seniors, and graduate students will enable thousands more young people and returning students to get the education and skills they'll need to succeed in the 21st century. 
The tax provisions of this package will provide much needed tax relief for working families, for family-owned businesses and farms, and for those who have invested in their homes and communities. This bill is good for those who work hard, play by the rules, and pay their taxes. 
The child tax credit will provide relief to some 27 million families. When the credit is fully phased in, families with children under 17 years of age will be able to claim a $500 per child credit. We ensure that working families who qualify for the earned income tax credit--who may not pay income taxes but who do pay payroll taxes--will also benefit from the child tax credit. That means we will provide help to families with incomes below $30,000--from the firefighters in Baltimore County to the watermen on the Chesapeake Bay. They work hard, they contribute to our economy and our communities, and they deserve our help. 
This bill rewards investment and thrift. It will allow Americans who have invested in their communities by the purchase of a home to be able to recoup their investment when they sell that home, without being subject to onerous capital gains taxes. It ensures that people who have built a family farm or a small business with a lifetime of hard work can pass that enterprise on to the next generation. 
It encourages savings. The bill's new IRA provisions will reward those who practice self help, by increasing access to IRA's, and by allowing withdrawals from IRA's for the first-time home buyers and for educational purposes. 
Mr. President, this budget package does not provide everything I would like, and I do not like every provision of this package. But I believe overall, this is an agreement well worth supporting. 
These conference reports finish the job the Congress began in 1993, when the President and congressional Democrats passed the deficit reduction bill. In 1992, our deficit was $290 billion. This year, it will be less than $45 billion. This historic economic plan started us on the road to elimination of our deficit. The bills we are passing this week will finish the job we began in 1993. 
This is a victory for fiscal responsibility. It is a victory for America's families. It keeps faith with our seniors, opens the doors of opportunity to those seeking an education, protects children's healthy and rewards those who save and who invest. I am proud to support it.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have a question for the distinguished Senator from Alabama and the distinguished Senator from New Jersey concerning discretionary funding for the Interstate 4-R Program. The report accompanying S. 1048 includes language recognizing certain projects that should receive priority attention when the Federal Highway Administration awards discretionary grants. 
In Frederick, MD, there is a project to upgrade Interstate 70 at its conjunction with Interstate 270, U.S. 15, U.S. 40, and U.S. 340. The complicated interchanges of these two expressways and the other U.S. highways have numerous ramp movements which need to be reconstructed and upgraded in order to provide efficient and safe access. The current interchange forces traffic onto local streets jeopardizing safety for local residents. 
I ask my colleagues whether they believe the upgrading of I-70 in Frederick would qualify as a project that might receive funds under the Interstate 4-R Program.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Byrd resolution on global climate change and I urge my colleagues to support it. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution. 
This resolution explains what the ground rules should be if the United States is to become a signer of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This resolution would prohibit the ratification of any treaty that would seriously threaten the economy of the United States. It says that both industrialized nations and developing countries must share the burden of any globally binding treaty on climate change equally. 
I support the Byrd resolution for one simple, but very compelling reason--jobs. For those of you who thought you'd hear a vacuum sound pulling jobs overseas following NAFTA implementation--you ain't heard nothin' yet. The only thing this treaty will do, the way it is written now, is destroy American industry as we know it. I will not be a party to any treaty or agreement that sends American jobs overseas. Business won't have any incentive to maintain or build new factories in the United States. 
Let me be clear: I support international efforts to improve the environment. But the effort must truly be international if we are to make any progress. I do not believe efforts to control or reduce global warming will be successful unless rapidly developing countries are forced to take the kind of tough steps that the United States will have to take. 
We cannot be a part of a binding international agreement that lets countries such as China, South Korea, and India off the hook. Developing nations do contribute to global warming. If we exempt them from the restrictions mandated for the industrialized nations, we will simply see a shifting of pollution, not a reduction. This is not what anyone wants to see happen. 
The objective of the treaty being negotiated is to curb global climate change. The United States has already taken steps to achieve this goal. At the beginning of President Clinton's first term, he released his administration's version of a domestic climate change action plan. 
This plan relies on a comprehensive set of voluntary actions by industry, utilities, and other large-scale energy users. It also promotes energy efficiency upgrades through new building codes in residential and commercial sectors. Large-scale tree planting and forest reserves are encouraged, as well as increased use of hydroelectric power sources. 
These are important steps which will have a positive impact on our global climate. We certainly must continue to research causes of global climate change, and come up with scientifically sound solutions. Our viability as a nation and planet depends on it. 
But we cannot throw away American jobs based on a plan that could have only a marginal impact on climate change. Coming up with the right plan should have little effect on the American economy, because it will mean an overall sustainability of the global environment, and the continuation of the United States as a leader of technological and industrial innovation. 
Once again, Mr. President, I support this commonsense resolution, which will simply ensure that American jobs won't be lost as we address the issue of global climate change. I am hopeful we can pass this resolution and move on to the next stage of protecting our global environment. I thank the Chair.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to strongly support and cosponsor the McConnell amendment to restore modest funding for the National Endowment for Democracy. I commend the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee for his continued leadership on this important matter. 
The National Endowment for Democracy is a proven, cost-effective investment in democracy. It represents our national interests and our values. 
As a member of the Commerce, State, Justice Subcommittee, I am disappointed that no funds were provided for a program that so effectively strengthens democracy around the world. Today we seek to restore funding to continue this important tool of American foreign policy. 
The cold war may be over--but dictatorships and military juntas still exist. Democracy is still fragile in too many countries. Rigged elections still occur, and freedom of speech is not a universal right. The National Endowment for Democracy provides the tools of democracy. It encourages a free press, unions, and multiparty elections. It supports women's participation in the electoral process. It assists grassroots organizations that support democracy and human rights. 
The National Endowment for Democracy has a remarkable track record. It was one of the early supporters of the Solidarity movement in Poland. It helped to draft South Africa's constitution. 
But NED does not rest on it laurels. Today, in Albania, Burma, and Cuba--NED is supporting democracy. It provides assistance to the only independent newspaper in Bosnia. It is helping to empower women in Turkey. It is helping Asian organizations to fight against the use of child labor. 
Mr. President, the cold war is over--but American leadership is still important. We are still the strongest voice for democracy. I urge my colleagues to join me is supporting the National Endowment for Democracy--one of our most important tools in supporting democracy around the world.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by Senator DeWine. 
The bill reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee would enable Federal employees, whose health insurance is provided under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, to receive coverage for abortion services. 
The DeWine amendment would prohibit coverage for abortion, except in cases of life endangerment, rape, or incest. It would continue a ban which has prevented Federal employees from receiving a health care service which is widely available for private sector employees. 
I oppose this amendment for two reasons. First of all, it is it is an assault on the earned benefits of Federal employees. Second, it is part of a continuing assault on women's reproductive rights and would endanger women's health. 
In the 104th Congress we saw vote after vote designed to roll back the clock on women's reproductive rights. In the last Congress, there were 53 votes in both the House and Senate on abortion-related issues. It's clear that this unprecedented assault on a woman's right to decide for herself whether or not to have a child is continuing in this Congress. 
Well, I support the right to choose. And I support Federal employees. And that is why I strenuously oppose this amendment. 
Let me speak first about our Federal employees. Some 280,000 Federal employees live in the State of Maryland. I am proud to represent them. They are the people who make sure that the Social Security checks go out on time. They make sure that our Nation's veterans receive their disability checks. At NIH, they are doing vital research on finding cures and better treatments for diseases like cancer, Parkinson's and Alzheimers. There is no American whose life is not touched in some way by the hard work of a Federal employee. They deserve our thanks and our support. 
Instead, Federal employees have suffered one assault after another in the last year or two. They have faced tremendous employment insecurity, as Government has downsized, and eliminated over 200,000 Federal jobs. Their COLA's and their retirement benefits have been threatened. They have faced the indignity and economic hardship of three Government shutdowns. Federal employees have been vilified as what is wrong with Government, when they should be thanked and valued for the tremendous service they provide to our country and to all Americans. 
I view this amendment as yet another assault on these faithful 
public servants. It goes directly after the earned benefits of Federal employees. Health insurance is part of the compensation package to which all Federal employees are entitled. The costs of insurance coverage are shared by the Federal Government and the employee. 
I know that proponents of continuing the ban on abortion coverage for Federal employees say that they are only trying to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion. But that is not what this debate is about. 
This is about prohibiting the compensation package of Federal employees from being used for a legal and sometimes vital medical service. Health insurance is part of the Federal employees pay. 
If we were to extend the logic of the argument of those who favor the ban, we would prohibit Federal employees from obtaining abortions using their own paychecks. After all, those funds also come from the taxpayers. 
But no one is seriously suggesting that Federal employees ought not to have the right to do whatever they want with their own paychecks. And we should not be placing unfair restrictions on the type of health insurance Federal employees can purchase under the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan. 
About 1.2 million women of reproductive age depend on the FEHBP for their medical care. We know that access to reproductive health services is essential to women's health. We know that restrictions that make it more difficult for women to obtain early abortions increase the likelihood that women will put their health at risk by being forced to continue a high-risk pregnancy. 
If we continue the ban on abortion services, and provide exemptions only in cases of life endangerment, rape, or incest, the 1.2 million women of reproductive health age who depend on the FEHBP will not have access to abortion even when their health is seriously threatened. We will be replacing the informed judgment of medical care givers with that of politicians. 
Decisions on abortion should be made by the woman in close consultation with her physician. These decisions should be made on the basis of medical judgment, not on the basis of political judgments. Only a woman and her physician can weigh her unique circumstances and make the decision that is right for that particular woman's life and health. 
It is wrong for the Congress to try to issue a blanket prohibition on insuring a legal medical procedure with no allowance for the particular set of circumstances that an individual woman may face. I deeply believe that women's health will suffer if we do so. 
I believe it is time to quit attacking Federal employees and their benefits. I believe we need to quit treating Federal employees as second class citizens. I believe Federal employees should be able to receive the same quality and range of health care services as their private sector counterparts. 
Because I believe in the right to choose and because I support Federal employees, I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating the DeWine amendment.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is, once again, a bipartisan agreement that we should continue to fund the space station Freedom. This dazzling scientific endeavor was created under the Reagan administration, sustained under the Bush administration, and maintained under the Clinton administration. 
Now, why have three Presidents of the United States all supported space station Freedom? They have done it for several reasons. One, because it accomplished significant science in space. Second, it is a model for what the new world order will look like in which no one nation dominates space, but each nation is best at what it best can do. The United States of America, Canada, Japan, Europe, and now the Russian involvement does show what the space program of the future will be. It will be multilateral, multinational cooperation for multiple gains. 
Mr. President, I would like to speak more on why I support the space station Freedom, but I note that on the floor is the Senator from Arizona. It had been our agreement to let him speak before the conference. 
I want to say, before we break for the party conferences, that there is no break in bipartisan support for the space station. We are going to ensure that the space station does produce sound science, have maximum international cooperation and, once again, make both our Nation and the world proud of what we do. I will have more to say about the space station and why I am an enthusiastic, unabashed, and unrelenting sponsor of this later on 
this afternoon. 
In the meantime, as a courtesy and collegiality to move our bill, I yield the floor now and look forward to resuming my comments on the space station later this afternoon.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from Colorado for not pressing for a vote on this amendment, how to use the taxpayer's dollar to really create not only opportunity in public housing but also how we can end the cycle of poverty, the culture of poverty, and for public housing to be a way to a better life. I am glad the authorizers are going to consider the bill. I look forward to listening to the recommendations. I know the senior Senator from Maryland is the ranking member and we will have many spirited discussions. So how best to provide for the poor, particularly also the working poor, is, indeed, a great challenge. We do not want to repeat mistakes in the future, but we also do not want to create new mistakes in the future. So the authorizing bill is a great way to do it. 
I thank the Senator from Colorado for his spirited advocacy and also for withdrawing the amendment. I yield the floor. 
The amendment (No. 947) was withdrawn.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what a moving story, what a moving story to hear about the Forgotten 216th. I am sure that this has been a considerable heartbreak for every member of that unit who went to ground zero. I am sure they went with good faith in themselves and in their Government, and yet over the last 45 years, they have endured terrible blows from their Government--one, the blow of exposing them to intense radiation with no protective gear; the second, that for 45 years, the very validity of their concerns about what happened to them and their need for medical treatment were, again, rejected by their U.S. Government. 
I thank the Senator for this type of amendment, because I will tell you today, I didn't want to, because of a budget situation, have to vote to reject them one more time. I think just as you have heard now from the chairman of the committee, we are going to take your amendment. We like your amendment, and I will tell you why we like your amendment. One, we are going to get to the facts about what this will cost, because too often, as the Senator from Minnesota knows, compelling human need gets all entangled over cost. This way we will know the cost. But then by asking the Veterans Affairs Committee to hold hearings within 60 days, it is a bit of a hammer, if you will, to ensure that there will be, as in our democracy, a public hearing on this. 
I say to my colleague from Minnesota that it has been my observation in 20 years--10 in the House and now over 10 in the Senate--that the VA, when it came to compensation for what our veterans were exposed to, never acted on their own. They only acted because Congress pushed for the facts. 
I thank the Senator from Minnesota for pushing for the facts in terms of this situation, the facts on cost, the facts on what happened to them, and the facts on the consequences to these veterans and how we need to address them. 
I say to my colleagues in the VA, not the committee, but in the Veterans' Administration, if you are listening to the debate, don't see this as a problem; see this as an opportunity, because here we can have one of the most unique longitudinal studies of what happened to men who were fit for duty when they walked at ground zero, and then what were their health consequences to both themselves and to their beloved wives, as well as to their children and their grandchildren. 
What a unique opportunity for both veterans, the Centers for Disease Control, and even NIH to welcome these men, to embrace these men as we try to redress the grievance that happened to them, and the lessons learned so that we then know what radiation did to people and offer insights that could help other people who have been exposed to radiation. So I thank the Senator for his amendment. I thank the Senator for his advocacy in this area. I look forward to accepting the amendment, and I look forward to hearing the CBO and the VA Committee's report.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to bring to my colleagues' attention that this amendment is Mikulski-Daschle-Bond amendment. It is being offered in concurrence with the chairman of the committee. 
What this does is provide funding for empowerment zones, the `America Reads' initiative and FEMA disaster mitigation. 
I want to note that the money that we provide is indeed a modest fund, but it, indeed, enables us to state that these are three priorities we wanted to consider in the appropriations, that we would have normally had a larger funding had the budget agreement not given us such a skimpy allocation. 
What does this amendment do? 
It provides $25 million to HUD for a new round of empowerment zones and enterprise communities. 
It also provides $20 million for the America Reads initiative at the Corporation for National Service. 
And it provides $5 million for FEMA's predisaster mitigation program. 
Mr. President, while this amendment provides funding for these three separate programs, we must remember that each of these three programs have in common, namely, that they really do directly assist the residents of our Nation with their day-to-day needs. 
First, Mr. President, this amendment, in providing $25 million for a second round of empowerment zones and enterprise communities, would promote job creation and economic development in economically distressed urban and rural areas. 
I am sure that we would all agree this is a critical need. Unfortunately, probably every Senator here has an area in their State that is economically distressed--urban, rural, or both. 
The first round of the program covered American communities of which 72 urban and 23 rural communities were either designated empowerment zones or enterprise communities. 
Mr. President, what this money actually goes for, though, is job creation, economic development, job training, and empowerment of local residents. The empowerment zone is not a quick fix, but it does offer opportunity and hope. 
In the area of America Reads, this amendment also provides $20 million for the America Reads initiative. This money would support 1,300 additional Corporation members who would serve as tutor coordinators. These tutor coordinators would provide direct tutoring and help mobilize and coordinate thousands of tutors to work with young children across the country. 
What is the purpose of the America Reads initiative? It is to help with local school systems to make sure that every child in the United States can read by the time they are in the third grade. 
It is the administration's policy, and I know supported on a bipartisan basis, that we want to see every child in the United States of America immunized by the time they are 2, screened and school-ready by the time they are 6, can read by the time they are in the third grade, and know how to use and have access to a computer by the time they are 12. That would enable our children to be ready for the 21st century. 
But let us be clear. It is not the Federal Government's job to supplant local school systems. What the America Reads initiative does is mobilize volunteer efforts, provide the infrastructure to be able to greatly utilize volunteers and, in addition to local school efforts, to help our kids read. In no way will it supplant local school efforts nor local school board policies. So it will be one of the better of the Federal and local partnerships. 
Mr. President, also, let us turn to Federal predisaster mitigation. I note that the Presiding Officer is from Pennsylvania. We have sure lived through a lot of floods the last 2 years. And it has been wonderful when FEMA has been able to respond `911' to our States. I know what Missouri endured, what our colleagues in the Dakotas and 12 other States did. 
But, you know, some Federal funds used wisely could actually prevent damage to either personal property or small business if we did some infrastructure planning. What this amendment does is provide $5 million for predisaster mitigation activities at FEMA. 
Last year, we provided $2 million for a pilot program identifying communities that could benefit from the money and build on it. Mr. President, this is a modest amount of money, but I believe will help tremendously in the future. 
In California, if we insist that earthquake standards are met, it then saves money when an earthquake hits. 
In Dade County, the officials there have a mitigation program to protect structures against hurricane force winds. 
And in my own State of Maryland, we had a unique partnership between the Governor of the State of Maryland and the Corps of Engineers to do a flood mitigation task force up in western Maryland where Pennsylvania and West Virginia coincide, and, in the area of the great floods, collided. 
So, Mr. President, this modest amount of money would really go a long way in helping us assess what we need to do to protect small business and personal property. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and I believe a dollar's worth of prevention will ultimately help us save $100 in disaster relief. 
Mr. President, as I stated, this amendment provides funding for three important programs: 
First, the amendment provides $25 million to HUD for a new round of empowerment zones and enterprise communities. 
The amendment also provides $20 million for America Reads Initiative activities at the Corporation for National Service. 
And the amendment provides $5 million for FEMA's predisaster mitigation program. 
Mr. President, while this amendment provides funding for three separate programs, we must remember what each of these programs have in common, namely, they all aim to directly assist residents of our great Nation. 
First Mr. President, this amendment would provide $25 million for a new round of empowerment zones and enterprise communities administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
The first round of empowerment zones were awarded in December 1994. The goal is to promote job creation and economic development in economically distressed urban and rural areas. 
I am sure we would all agree this is a critical need. Unfortunately, probably every Senator in here has an area in their State that is an economically distressed area--urban, rural, or both. 
The first round of the program covered a wide range of American communities. Seventy-two urban areas and 33 rural communities were designated empowerment zones or enterprise communities. 
There are currently eight urban empowerment zones and three rural empowerment zones. There are also 4 enhanced enterprise communities and 93 enterprise communities. 
Each empowerment zone received $100 million--Los Angeles received $125 million. Cleveland $90 million--each enhanced enterprise community received $25 million, and the 93 enterprise communities received $3 million. 
This money can be used for job creation and economic development activities--such as building renovations and infrastructure improvements. The money can also be used to provide services such as child care, job training and transportation for residents in the zones. 
In addition to the grant money, in each empowerment zone and enterprise community, employers are eligible for wage tax credits worth $3,000 for every employee hired who lives in the empowerment zone. The program is not just about moving employees from one location to another, it is also about providing employers incentives to help unemployed and underemployed zone residents. 
We are talking about a hand up, not a hand out. The tax credit provision is designed to provide an opportunity structure, a chance to work hard and earn a decent living. 
Empowerment zones and enterprise communities are also eligible for various other benefits including tax-exempt bond financing and tax writeoffs for depreciating personal property. 
Mr. President, the empowerment zone program is not a quick fix. Many of the communities are ones that have suffered for years from high unemployment, high crime, and other problems. The program is a 10-year effort that required partnerships between community residents, local and State governments, and local businesses. 
A recent GAO report noted that the zones have made some progress. The report notes that there is still work to be done, but the effort is progressing. The key is that the program is making progress and its deficiencies are ones that can be addressed. 
In its own assessment of the empowerment zones and enterprise communities, HUD notified five communities that they were not making sufficient progress. These communities risk having future funding withdrawn. The point is that this is not some HUD program run wild. There are standards and expectations that are being measured. 
Mr. President, the empowerment zone program is a good mix of Republican and Democratic ideas--tax incentives to leverage private dollars and community involvement in decisionmaking. 
Mr. President, this amendment also provides $20 million for the America Reads Initiative at the Corporation for National Service. This money would support approximately 1,300 additional corporation members who would serve as tutor coordinators. 
These tutor coordinators would provide direct tutoring and help to mobilize and coordinate thousands of tutors to work with young children across the country. 
The America Reads initiative is an administration effort that is truly worthy of bipartisan support. The goal is simple--every child in the Nation should be able to read independently and read well by the third grade. A simple, yet key goal in the effort to ensure that every child is equipped with the basic tools needed to compete in the 21st century. 
Mr. President, in 1994, 40 percent of fourth graders failed to attain the basic level of reading on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. This is a fact that we can't ignore and must address. 
Let me be clear, the reading deficiencies of our Nation's children won't be erased with volunteer tutors. There are issues of education funding and the delivery of education that need to be addressed. I am under no illusion that the America Reads initiative is the only answer. 
But Mr. President, I don't want us to make the perfect enemy of the good. The America Reads initiative is part of the answer. A Cohen, Kulik and Kulik analysis of 65 published studies showed that quality tutoring programs produced positive, though modest effects. Other studies done in Florida and England have found similar results. 
Mr. President, modest is in the eye of the beholder. If I am rich and only see a modest return on my stock investment, I may be disappointed. But if I am a child who can't read like I should be able to, and someone helps me improve my reading modestly so that I can understand words on a page, I am probably very happy with my modest gains. 
Mr. President, there have been many debates about the corporation for National Service. This amendment moves beyond that debate. The program will be funded and will continue to operate. This amendment seeks to provide some additional funding to support corporation activities that I am sure we all agree are worthwhile. 
Finally Mr. President, this amendment also provides $5 million for predisaster mitigation activities at FEMA. 
Mr. President, I don't know if there is a clearer example of `an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.' To put it in appropriations terms one might say that `a dime of prevention is worth a dollar of cure.' 
Currently, FEMA provides postdisaster mitigation money to communities--up to 15 percent of the amount they received for disaster recovery efforts. This money is important and necessary, but its' flaw is that it comes after a disaster has struck. 
Last year, the VA-HUD bill provides FEMA $2 million to begin a pilot program identifying communities that could benefit from predisaster mitigation money. This amendment seeks to provide money that would expand on that effort. 
Unfortunately, every Senators' State has likely placed a `911' call to FEMA. Many times, there is nothing that we can do to escape nature's fury. However, all to often, there are things that we can do to reduce the risk to life and property. From making sure buildings meet proper standards to moving structures out of high-risk areas, there are things we can do. 
Retrofitting a bridge in California to meet earthquake standards costs about $31 a square foot. Replacing a bridge that didn't meet standards would cost about $135 per square foot. 
In Dade County, FL, officials have a mitigation program designed to protect structures from hurricane force winds. A cost-benefit analysis showed that for every $1 dollar in mitigation money invested to protect an emergency housing center, $5 in future damage relief costs are likely saved. 
Mr. President, there are other examples I could site. The point is that the predisaster mitigation program is ultimately about saving lives, saving communities, and saving taxpayers' money. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment. It is designed to help provide opportunity structures and economic development for our Nation's distressed urban and rural communities through the empowerment zone and enterprise communities program. 
The amendment also provides support for the critical America Read initiative--designed to help ensure that all of the Nation's children can read properly by the fourth grade. 
Finally, the amendment provides support to a predisaster mitigation program designed to save lives, save communities and save taxpayers' money. 
Mr. President, I believe this amendment addresses concerns that transcend party lines. It is designed to support programs that directly impact the citizens of our Nation. 
I want to especially thank Senator Daschle for his support, and Senator Bond for his willingness to work with me on this important effort. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. President, I hope that we can move expeditiously and adopt this amendment and make a great step forward in giving empowerment and help to our local communities.  
Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We laid it aside. I did not know if we had come back to it. 
Mr. President, I rise again this year in support of America's space program and in opposition to the Bumpers amendment, which would strike funding for the space station. 
I have said this before, and I will say it again: This amendment is a choice between the future and the past. The question is, what kind of country will the United States of America be in the 21st century? Will we be one that uses technology to help people with their day-to-day lives and keep America employed in the field of manufacturing? Then, if the answer to that is yes, we must embrace science, we must embrace technology, and we must be willing to take bold risks in scientific endeavors. 
That is what the space station is all about. 
We need to ask ourselves, will we use American ingenuity and know-how through the unique environment of space to tackle our understanding of disease or develop new technologies that can be used here at home. 
Yesterday, probably one of the most distinguished Americans and one of the most distinguished U.S. Senators, Senator John Glenn of Ohio, spoke eloquently about America's space program from not only the time he rocketed around the Earth making world history but talking about the kind of scientific breakthroughs that are coming out of our space program. Right this very moment, little Sojourner is moving around Mars, gathering important information. We have done it in a way that is faster, cheaper and quicker than any other space project that we have done with such a big bang in terms of scientific information. Why are we able now to be able to move with such speed? It is because we have made such significant investments in projects like the space shuttle and the space station. 
Some will argue that science carried out on the space station can really be accomplished more cost-effectively on the planet Earth. This simply is not true. The science proposed for the station cannot be accomplished on Earth at any price or at any time. Space station science requires sustained access to something called low levels of gravitational force. It is technologically impossible to create a low-gravity environment for this type of research without getting out there and being in orbit. What are these types of research? One is microgravity. The benefits of microgravity research may be numerous, including new and more pure pharmaceuticals, medical advancements, the production of new materials to use on Earth, new fire-resistant materials, new fire retardation. Just think, we might come up with a whole new concept for building supplies that can make our homes, schools, hospitals and nursing homes safe for fire. 
Others will say, why not do this science on the shuttle? Why do you need to go in orbit and stay out there in orbit? I want to bring this point to their attention. The shuttle can stay up in orbit, max, about 2 weeks. We do not limit cancer researchers to 2 weeks in a lab at NIH to find a cure for a devastating disease. Why should we limit the life sciences to only 2 weeks in space? Much of the proposed research will take months, if not years, to complete. 
Now, even though the astronauts might come back, the space science can continue to stay up in those racks on the space station. Remember what the space station is--it is not a station, it is a laboratory. It is not a station like a gas station, like a subway station. It is, literally, a laboratory in the sky that will have modules run by different countries. Japan, Canada, the European Space Agency, we are now in cooperation with the Russians--they will be planning part of the evacuation vehicle, and primarily the control of the station will be in the hands of an American astronaut. It is truly international and it will be truly profound. 
While working on this issue, we wanted to be sure that we had adequate, maximum, robust participation from the NIH with the National Space Agency. We encouraged and then literally brought about a joint agreement between the National Institutes of Health and NASA. 
Just a few years ago, Mr. Dan Goldin, the Administrator at NASA, Dr. Bernadine Healy, who was appointed by President Bush to be head of NIH at the Space Museum, signed a memorandum of understanding making sure that NIH and NASA are collaborating on life science research and also that we get maximum benefits from the space station. 
One of the arguments that we hear every year is about cost. Sure, the space station does cost money. We have heard that GAO estimated that the station would cost $90 billion. That is what the Senator from Arkansas had in his info chart this morning. However, I want to say to my colleagues and to those who have been 
following this all day, that number is misleading. When calculating the total cost, the GAO included a large portion of the NASA human space flight budget in its analysis. The fact is that $51 billion of the $94 billion is for shuttle missions that will fly, regardless of whether we have the station or not. Those shuttles have missions to do and they are going to go anyway. So that figure is misleading. The real cost of the station, which includes final development and construction over a 10-year period is about $30 billion. No small change, but it is not $94 billion. The remaining balance of the erroneous $94 billion estimate is life science and microgravity research. This research will continue, in less effective form on the shuttle, with or without the space station. 
Now, what is the cost to America if we do not do the station? We hear about the cost to maintain it, to build it. Well, the United States of America has already invested $9 billion in the redesign of the space station. What does that mean? The actual work on the space station means there are 15,000 highly skilled engineering and production contract jobs directly supporting the space station. There are 35,000 contract workers and 5,000 civil servants who work on the shuttle whose major customer for the foreseeable future is the space station. And 2,000 pounds of hardware have already been built for the U.S. portion of the station. 
As mentioned earlier, long-duration microgravity research and cell and developmental biology, human physiology, biotech, fluid physics, combustion science, materials science, benchmark physics, as well as an understanding of Earth-based diseases are the core of what is the research. Biotech, combustion science, material science, and then, indeed, one of the most basic of all sciences, increased knowledge of physics. There will be practical applications of what we do. We cannot list every single one of those right this minute but we do know that we will be well on our way for materials research and life science research. 
Mr. President, what else do we lose? U.S. credibility with our international partners. Russia, Japan, Europe, and Canada have already invested more than half of the $9 billion they have committed to the space station. This is a great symbol of the post-cold war era in which former arch rivals in space are now working together to build a space station for the 21st century. 
U.S. competitiveness can only be maintained by continuing the long-term, cutting edge, high risk R&D that is an essential part to the space station development. The momentum gained with the June delivery of something called Node 1 to the Kennedy Space Center marking the beginning of a stream of flight elements that will continue for the next 5 years. 
And finally, we lose all of the hard work that has gone into this project since the 1980's and the opportunity to see it culminate on the first launch, now less than a year away. 
Mr. President, we could argue these points all night but I will not put my friends through this discussion. The bill is already taking a substantial amount of debate time. We will soon vote on the Bumpers amendment, and I am asking every Senator to think long and hard about what this amendment means. I really urge my colleagues to reject the Bumpers amendment. 
At the same time, I want to acknowledge the effort made by the Senator from Arkansas. Over the last few years when he has pushed for eliminating the space station from the budget, it has forced us to do several things, including taking a good, long hard look at the cost and making sure we were getting our money's worth, to take a good long hard research look at the research to make sure we could not do it someplace else faster, quicker and cheaper. The answer, though, is no, we must do this research if we are going to do it at all in space. 
I believe the Senator from Arkansas has made, indeed, a national contribution by forcing us to relook at the space station and to justify why we do need the space station. So we thank him for his national leadership on that. 
Mr. President, I really do believe that to vote to remove the space station now will really be a terrible blow to America's space station. Mr. President, I am going to urge the defeat of the Bumpers amendment and to once again be able to stay the course, complete the space station and move this country and the space station into the 21st century. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, rise in opposition to the Bumpers amendment. Though well-intentioned, it is not necessary and could inadvertently, by placing a cap, lead to real concern in the area of safety. 
First, we do not want to tie the hands of the NASA administrator. Second, since fiscal year 1994, the station has been subject to funding limitations, a $2.1 billion annual funding and a $17.4 billion overall funding through the completion of the assembly. Yes, these limitations are not legislatively mandated; they have been administratively carried out. 
There are many references to these specific limitations to the space station budget and congressional proceedings. For example, the $17.4 billion total cap through the completion of the assembly. Recent reports indicate that NASA is expected to build the station within these limits. We should not legislate a cap. In good faith, NASA continues to meet these goals. Any additional money sought is for unforeseen problems either associated with the Russian service module or where we might now identify a certain series of safety concerns. We are learning lessons from Mir. 
I don't want to tie the hands of NASA or threaten the lives of astronauts. I really encourage our colleagues to vote no on Bumpers and await the wise counsel of the authorizing committee on this issue. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. MIKULSKI. If the Senator from Arkansas would just allow a kudos comment. I thank the Senator for withdrawing his amendment, though I know that he is in no way retreating from his position. We acknowledge that position and we look forward to hearing both from him and the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee on his advice in this matter. Thanks again.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know that the VA often has very special circumstances where doctors, perhaps from other countries, or graduates from international medical schools, are present in our VA hospitals to help with either special assignments or special chores. 
From what I can understand, there was an error in last year's immigration bill that really shackled VA from the flexibility it had in this area. From what I understand, the Bumpers amendment is a benign amendment. It does not create a new classification. It does not create a new entitlement to either come to this country or stay in this country. It just reaffirms kind of what was once a usual and customary practice by the VA. So I don't anticipate an objection.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in a few minutes we will vote on the VA-HUD appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. I want to take this opportunity to thank the chairman, Senator Bond, and his staff for working with those of us on this side of the aisle in such a collegial way. I think the fact that we were able to finish this bill tonight says a lot about the bipartisan cooperation that we have received, or has occurred between both Senator Bond, myself, and the other Members of the U.S. Senate. 
Today, I note that we had robust discussions on important policy matters. But if one would note, the whole tone was one of civility, consideration, and collegiality. I am very proud of the way this bill has moved. 
I am also very proud of the substance in this bill. We have met compelling human need with veterans and the poor. We have stood sentry over the important issues related to the environment, protected consumers, and ensured that Arlington Cemetery would be as fit for duty as the brave people were who lie therein. And we have, at the same time, had a very serious issue addressed in the area of science and technology funding. 
So veterans' health research that will be looking at issues related to both women's health and prostate cancer, to our important space program that shows it is the best in the world, to the National Science Foundation which is looking at how we can ensure that brilliant young investigators are going to be able to have the new ideas for the 21st century that are going to lead to new products says a lot about what this bill does. 
I enjoy very much serving as the ranking member and my job is made easier, more delightful, and gives me pride because of the cooperation of the majority, both its chairman and staff. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my own staff because it takes a lot of reviewing of a lot of line items when you have seven Cabinet-level agencies and 25 other independent agencies. I would like to thank Andy Givens, my chief clerk; David Bowers for his hard work, and our excellent detailee, Stacy Closson. 
So as we move on to the rollcall vote, I again look forward to working with my very able chair in the conference and bringing a great conference report back to the Senate where we can continue the pride we feel as we vote on this bill tonight. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I have discussed the floor situation with the Democratic leadership. They are currently doing a hotline asking that all Democrat Senators who have amendments to please apprise us of them this evening so that we will be able to report to the chairman tomorrow and to our leadership what those amendments are. 
Upon the completion tomorrow on Treasury, postal, it would be my hope that anyone who must offer amendments on NASA--and some amendments have been traditionally offered on NASA--that they be on the floor so we can do this before the party conference. I know there are many Senators who have given a great deal of thought on how to improve these programs. We will be anxious to hear about their amendments. 
So, Madam President, we are doing our best to make progress on this particular bill, and moving this bill forward. We will be able to report to you tomorrow morning. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, very much, Madam President. 
Today, I rise to join my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Missouri, to offer for floor debate and the consideration of the Senate the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill for VA-HUD and independent agencies. 
This is an extraordinary bill because it deals with 7 Cabinet-level Government agencies and 18 other agencies that are important to the United States of America. These agencies range from Veterans, Housing, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Space Agency, the National Science Foundation, Federal Emergency Management Agency, as well as the National Corporation for Volunteer Services, and we go on to Selective Service. 
People would be surprised to know that Arlington Cemetery is also funded in this bill. We stand sentry for consumers through the consumer product safety legislation. Those little pamphlets that taxpayers send for from Pueblo, CO, a big chunk of their funding comes out of this bill. 
So when we say veterans, housing, and independent agencies, this is probably, along with defense and the Labor-HHS bill, the most complex bill. Therefore, when we bring it to the Senate, sometimes our funding sounds like it is significant in terms of its dollar amount, but we really have worked very hard to get a dollar's worth of services for a dollar of taxes. 
The bill before the Senate is a $90 billion bill that includes $21.5 billion in mandatory spending which is primarily directed at veterans, and appropriates a total of $69.4 billion in discretionary budget authority. This is almost equal to the House in total funding, and more than $90 million below what President Clinton requested. However, the allocation for the Senate, which is the total amount given to us to spend, was almost $800 million below that of the House. 
Given the tight allocation, the chairman and I did the best we could to balance the needs of diverse groups of agencies funded within this subcommittee. With a better allocation, we could have funded all the agencies in this bill at higher levels. But we were ready to make tough choices and set priorities. 
On the majority of the aspects of the bill, I want to say unequivocally I support Senator Bond, the chairman of the committee, the Republican, on his priorities. There are some yellow flashing lights related to President Clinton's agenda that I will address in my remarks, but we are very much in sync and in alignment with what we want to do. I am particularly grateful for Chairman Bond's efforts reflected in this bill to continue many of the initiatives voted by the subcommittee over the past several years when I chaired it. 
As I said, I wholeheartedly agree with Chairman Bond's attempt also to avoid controversial riders this year and to keep out significant new legislative provisions not dealt with by this subcommittee. We have essentially said to Democrats and Republicans alike, don't play pin the tail on the donkey with this bill, adding controversial riders, and also, if you have new ideas for new initiatives, hey, why not try the authorizing committee for a change and see if we can move legislation that way. 
There are several things, though, that I really approve of in this bill. Both Chairman Bond and myself consider veterans to be a very high priority and veterans medical programs to be of special priority. This bill restores $300 million worth of cuts assumed in the budget agreement and puts them in veterans medical care and also in veterans medical research. Veterans funding remains a key concern of mine, and I will continue to fight to ensure that promises made are promises kept. I will also stand sentry to make sure that the Veterans Administration meets its projections in third-party insurance collections that are designed to help increase medical care spending. 
This bill also restores several cuts made to key programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This was restored as the community development block grant funds so important to mayors and local communities, the project HOME, public housing and homeless assistance. 
Also, something I am particularly pleased to work with Chairman Bond on is we restored the cuts in elderly and disabled housing. When the budget agreement was first proposed, there was a suggestion that this particular area of funding receive $400 million. Senator Bond and I agreed we should fully fund it at last year's level and have $839 million that will go to being able to build housing for the elderly and for the disabled. 
The Senate bill has also added a modest increase to the Hope 6 revitalization program. This is a program that is very important because, hopefully, it ends public housing in the way we know it and says that public housing should not be a way of life, but be a way to a better life. Always where there is compelling need there is often sometimes sloppy administration. I concur with the report language offered by Senator Bond directing the Government Accounting Office to continue its analysis of Hope 6 to make sure that the effectiveness of the program is being monitored to ensure that for those receiving Hope 6 benefits in public housing, which was designed to community build and have work force readiness, the GAO will make sure that the work force readiness aspect is really doing what it should. 
Then we move on to our very important science programs as well as Federal Emergency Management. Thanks to the efforts of this subcommittee, the national space agency, the National Science Foundation, and Federal Emergency Management are all funded at the President's request level. We, on this side of the aisle, say thank you, thank you to Chairman Bond for working with us to make sure that core science programs are funded and Federal Emergency Management continues to be fit for duty should other people around the United States have to dial 911. I think all of us who watched Hurricane Danny were glad it was downgraded to a tropical storm, but when it hits Alabama with over 25 inches of rain in a very short time and you see people carrying out their children and their most precious possessions, we know why FEMA exists. 
Despite the tight allocation, I am pleased we were able to 
meet the President's request for these key agencies while protecting the funding in veterans medical care, disaster relief, critical science and space. I think America has to be incredibly thrilled with the breakthroughs NASA has made as Sojourner continues to roll across Mars. Scientific developments, such as the Sojourner, the Hubble telescope, Mission to Planet Earth, are truly special American projects, and show that we are No. 1 in space. FEMA is another agency that is doing a very good job, and this critical agency has shown steady improvement in recent years in responding to America's natural disasters. 
Madam President, I also want to call to your attention the fact that the administration does have some serious concerns with the reductions in this bill. I call these yellow flashing lights. Given the tight allocation, I understand that not all the programs could be funded at the President's request. Measures had to be taken, protective measures, for several key programs. That meant that other important initiatives could not be adequately addressed. So, in looking out for veterans' medical care, that meant fulfilling the President's full request for an $850 million increase to the EPA budget simply was not possible. As a result, the request for a 50-percent increase in the Superfund was not yet met. 
As you know, the President is a strong advocate of the Superfund. This will be a key issue to resolve during the upcoming weeks while the House and Senate are in conference on this bill. I really encourage the authorizers, while we are in conference, to try to pass the authorizing bill so that the authorizing bill could match, perhaps, what we were able to do in conference. 
Another yellow flashing light is the $146 million reduction to the President's request for the Corporation for National and Community Service. This request was to be used for the President's program called the America Reads Challenge. It is to be a national literacy campaign to ensure that every child can read, and read well and independently, by the third grade. The budget agreement called for funding in this program. However, it was not funded in either the House or the Senate bill. 
Illiteracy in this country is of great concern for all, and all ages, but, really, if we could make sure every child was immunized by the time they were 2, could read by the time they were in third grade, had access and knew how to use a computer by the time they were 12, we would do a lot about empowering our children. I support the restoration of that funding. 
A third flashing light to the administration is the elimination of funding for the community development financial institutions, something called CDFI, another program that was protected in the budget agreement, which helps to spur business activity and traditionally underserved communities, and is particularly focused on microenterprise endeavors that enable women of modest means to be able to move in terms of economic development in business. The House bill funded this at $125 million, and we hope this will be a restoration where there is some type of agreement. This is a high priority of mine during the conference. 
It will be my intent to offer an amendment or perhaps work with Senator Bond as we go through the other amendments to see if we could not address the issues of empowerment zones, America Reads, and Federal emergency mitigation efforts to see if we could find some funds to be able to have a placemarker in this budget going to conference for these very important programs. 
I do appreciate Chairman Bond's willingness to fund the EPA brownfields request and the inclusion of the report language allowing the HUD-CDBG money to be used for brownfield activities. A concern for the administration is the absence of the request of increase for the HUD brownfields program. The brownfields initiative can play a critical role in restoring urban areas. In my own home State of Maryland, in the Baltimore metropolitan area alone, we estimate that there are over 3,000 acres of brownfields in and around our port area which, if we could clean them up, would offer kind of a second version of an empowerment zoning. 
Madam President, given these concerns, I will be offering an amendment, as I said, that will restore funding, some funding, modest funding, for the America Reads Program under the Corporation for National Service, empowerment zoning in the HUD budget and predisaster mitigation for FEMA. I will in no way make an effort to restore full funding for those programs, because it just is not fair. But I will be looking to see what we could do to have a placemarker to go to conference. 
Madam President, there is mixed news in this bill for the administration. Like you, I am interested in producing a final bill that is agreeable and signable. I believe the bill that we have produced is a very good start. In fact, it is an excellent start to ensuring funding for many of this Nation's vital programs. I will work with my colleagues now on the floor to see how we could accommodate them. I will work with my chairman during conference and continue to try to address the administration's concern. 
In closing, I want to thank Senator Bond again for his hard work and his willingness to listen to my side of the aisle's concerns and to honor many of the requests made by President Bill Clinton. I am pleased, when it came to funding like NASA, like the National Science Foundation, the funding for Federal Emergency Management, it knew no party, because when we are up there on Sojourner, when we might have to be part of the rescue operation for Mir, when we are doing so many very important things at the National Science Foundation and helping rescue Americans who have been hit by national disasters, this is not about party. I commend the cooperative nature in which this bill has been crafted. I believe we have produced a bill that can be signed into law with some of the appropriate amendments in conference consideration. 
Madam President, before I yield the floor, I say to all of my colleagues from my side of the aisle, if you have amendments, please let us know them. We know that between now and 5:15 when we start voting on Treasury, Post Office, it would be enormously useful to Senator Bond and myself to know what any amendments are so that we could either work with you to accommodate you or be able to set the stage on how we can proceed with this bill. I believe it is Senator Bond's intention, and I will do my best to cooperate with him, that we will conclude this bill tomorrow at the earliest possible time. 
Having said that, I look forward to the debate, as always, on this bill and, as always, have enjoyed working with my colleague, Senator Bond. I yield the floor.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the VA-HUD Committee, of which NASA is one of our key agencies, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his detailed speech about what NASA is doing, not only today, but what it will do tomorrow. I believe the Senator, by talking about the exciting projects that we have, many of which have originated from the work at the Johnson space station, in the Presiding Officer's home State, the work in the area of health care. I visited these programs, know the merit they have, particularly in cancer research, tumor research, the issues outlined by the Senator from Ohio. 
Also, in 1992, NASA and NIH signed a joint memorandum of agreement on how they can work together to maximize the research being done by the space agency, along with NIH, on issues related particularly to cancer and to issues related to women's health. Issues like osteoporosis, the same kinds of problems that the astronauts face being in orbit, are what many face, particularly we women on Earth. We lose bone density. 
There has been a lot of joint effort and a lot of joint agreement. I think the Senator made a very valuable contribution and I thank him for his remarks. 
Sometimes for those of us who seek funding for NASA, it sounds self-serving, that we would tout, pull out an item or two. But when Senator John Glenn, an astronaut-Senator, speaks to it, I think the whole world listens. 
We thank him for his comments and his contribution to the Senate and to the American space program. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Lautenberg amendment to cut foreign aid to any country that violates U.N. sanctions against Libya. You cannot seek to undermine important policies of the United States and expect to receive economic assistance. 
The international community imposed sanctions on Libya because of their failure to extradite their intelligence agents who were indicted for the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. This one act of terrorism cost the lives of 270 people. 
Libya provides sanctuary to their murderers. Yet Egypt--which receives billions of dollars of United States aid--has allowed Libyan airlines to land on their soil. They also attempted to weaken U.N. sanctions and even to build a free trade zone with Libya. 
The families of those murdered on Pan Am 103 need no reminder of why we have sanctions on Libya. They live with this tragedy every day of their lives. Seven people from Maryland died in this tragedy. They were Michael Bernstein, Jay Kingham, Karen Noonan, Ann Lindsey Otenasek, Lousie Rogers, Miriam Wolf, and Jordy Williams. 
They were so young. They were college students, a young Army lieutenant, a businessman and a lawyer. They were sons, daughters, and fathers. We swore that we would never forget them. We would improve airline safety, we would fight terrorism--and most importantly, we would seek justice. 
One of the victims, Michael Bernstein, was a renowned Nazi hunter working for the Justice Department. Throughout his life, he sought justice for the victims of the Holocaust. How tragic that his family has not yet had justice.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. 
It is my understanding that the foreign operations bill for fiscal year 1998, S. 955, includes an increase of $30 million to combat infectious diseases such as TB, malaria, dengue fever, and the ebola virus. 
It has been brought to my attention that the Gorgas Memorial Institute is developing an innovative regional TB control initiative designed to address major issues in reducing the global TB epidemic through training and new approaches to disease control. I believe the work done at the institute would fit well with the priorities outlined by the committee. 
Would the ranking member join me in urging the Agency for International Development to provide funding for this initiative?

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate 14 individuals who recently completed the American Association of Health Plans [AAHP] Minority Management Development Program [MMDP]. This intensive year-long fellowship program prepares minority managers for middle management positions in network-based health plans. 
The 1997 graduates are: Cheryl Bitoun, M.H.A.; Michelle Browne, M.P.A., M.S.W.; Kendrick Carpenter; Janice Cartera; Bernadette Cooper, M.H.A.; Lisa Lawrence Eggleston, R.N., M.H.A.; Juli Harkins, M.S.H.A.; Lisa Little Axe; Elizabeth Mendoza, M.B.A., M.H.A.; and Erik Thorne, M.P.H. 
The Minority Management Development Program was created in 1994 when AAHP and the health plan community recognized the need to develop diverse management teams--especially in light of the growing number of minorities joining health plans. Since the MMDP's inception in 1992, 42 fellows of diverse ethnic backgrounds have participated in this innovative management training program and have distinguished themselves as leaders throughout the health care community. The MMDP is a comprehensive program designed to provide managerial training, work experience, and knowledge of health plans through focused didactic and practical interactive training opportunities. The program's varied curriculum is focused on key health care related management tools, including quality management and accreditation, marketing, delivery systems, financial management, and operations. 
Fellows in the 1997 class trained at health plans in Washington, DC, and in several neighboring counties in Maryland. This year's training sites were Kaiser Foundation Health Plan/Mid-Atlantic States, Rockville, MD; NYLCare Health Plans, Greenbelt, MD; Blue Cross & Blue Shield of the National Capital Area and Chartered Health Plan in Washington, DC, and Total Health Care, Inc. and Prudential Health Care Plan in Baltimore, MD. Next year, the program will expand to provide training at additional sites in four southwestern States: Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and California. 
AAHP is the national association representing health maintenance organizations [HMO's], preferred provider organizations [PPO's], and other similar health plans. Together, these health plans provide care for more than 140 million Americans. 
I hope that this Congress will recognize that programs such as the Minority Management Development Program are of vital importance and that they meet a critical need in the education and training of America's health professionals.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much. On behalf of Mr. Wellstone and myself, we have an amendment at the desk that will strike the committee action and restore something called the Boren amendment. The Boren amendment was passed and signed by President Reagan in 1981 to ensure adequate access to health care services for Medicaid beneficiaries. 
The Boren amendment simply stated that payment rates for hospitals and nursing homes must be reasonable and adequate to meet the cost of operating the facilities. That is reimbursements by Medicaid. Now, under the committee action, we would take that away. We would give permission to States to further reduce payment rates to nursing homes at this time. This would have a devastating affect on quality care, and it would have a devastating affect on access to care for beneficiaries. 
The simple fact is that Medicaid payment rates to nursing homes does affect quality and our ability to meet the standards that are mandated for health and safety. Nursing homes have stopped taking Medicaid patients. Because of that, I urge adoption of the amendment.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the point of order by Senator Durbin to strike the language increasing the eligibility age of Medicare from 65 to 67. 
I oppose raising the eligibility age because it breaks the promise of health insurance at age 65 for all Americans. The change was made to balance the budget. It was not to make a better, more efficient health care system. The change will hurt people who work hard and play by the rules. 
In 1965, our country realized that it was important to make sure that all Americans over the age of 65 had health insurance. For those Americans that did not have the ability to purchase health insurance, Medicare was there. 
It was a promise that America's seniors had somewhere to go. Now, we are breaking that promise. I can't support that. Promises made must be promises kept. 
We can't turn our backs on people who have planned their lives depending on our promises. 
This change wasn't done to help people. It wasn't done to improve the system. It wasn't done to make sure that seniors in Maryland and the country will have a longer and happier life. 
It was done to balance the budget. It was done to save a few dollars. 
No thought was given to the real life effects on America's seniors. 
Raising the eligibility age hurts people when they need insurance most: in their sixties, at the end of their working lives. 
Retirees cannot afford insurance at that age if they can even find it. 
What do we say to the factory workers and construction workers whose bodies are worn down by age 60? 
Now when they need insurance the most, it isn't there. The government just moved the Medicare age another 2 years away. 
Before we start to make big changes in Medicare, we need to talk to the most important people to consider: The people who use the program. 
We need to ask them what works, what could be better, and what we should change. 
We need to have a national bipartisan debate on what Medicare should look like. 
We need Presidential leadership. 
I want the people of Maryland to be a part of that debate. 
That way, if we need to make big changes, everyone will have had a chance to speak up and be heard. 
Everyone will understand the changes. 
Raising the eligibility age penalizes the citizens of Maryland and the rest of the country who have worked hard, saved, and played by the rules. 
I ask the other Senators to join me and Senators Durbin and Reed to support this amendment. 
Let's strike the increase in the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67. 
We do not serve in the Senate to tell Americans, `we needed a few more dollars for our budget so you'll have to change your plans.' 
We should listen to people, debate options, and make the hard choices openly. 
Let's not change the rules during the middle of the game and the middle of the night.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I rise to support the Kennedy-Mikulski amendment, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this amendment. This amendment strikes the Medicare means-testing provision in this bill. I am adamantly opposed to Medicare means testing. I have two very grave concerns about the legislation pending. First, it breaks the bonds of faith between the people and their Government. Second, it overturns 30 years of Medicare in 3 days, without any hearings and no real debate. 
This bill breaks faith with seniors. It breaks faith with workers currently paying into Medicare. This bill says if you paid into Medicare under one set of rules, you are going to receive your benefits under a completely different set of rules. The bill penalizes those who work hard, save and try to play by the rules. 
This bill puts a previous condition on getting Medicare benefits: the money you saved. It tells the American people that their savings account counts against them when they are ready for Medicare. 
I believe that promises made must be promises kept. This bill breaks that promise. 
If I were a financial planner, I would advise the senior citizens in Maryland, `Go to Ocean City for a vacation, buy a big car, live it up. Don't save your money for retirement, because the Government will take it away from you and increase Medicare deductibles, increase Medicare premiums and place a penalty on you for your savings. If you don't have any money, at least then you might qualify for Medicare.' 
But I am not a financial planner. I am a U.S. Senator, and it is my job to stand sentry to protect Medicare. 
Medicare was meant to be portable, affordable and undeniable. The purpose of Medicare was to provide health insurance to senior citizens because the private sector wouldn't do it in a way that was affordable, portable and universal for people over the age of 65. 
Medicare premiums will now go beyond what some private insurance policies now cost. This provision ends Medicare, as we know it, and turns it into a welfare program. This is unacceptable. 
We must ask ourselves, who are we making Medicare affordable for? Is Medicare meant to be affordable for senior citizens, or was it meant to be affordable for Government? I want to make sure that Medicare is affordable to the senior citizens who need it. 
Let's be realistic, we do have a problem with Medicare. Yes, 
the clock is ticking on solvency. Yes, we do need to address this problem with a sense of urgency. 
As we are concerned about the future solvency of Medicare, we need to be concerned about the solvency of senior citizens. They need Medicare now. This bill attacks them when they are sick, when they are most vulnerable, and it does nothing or little to make Medicare solvent. 
For those young people working who are now in their twenties, thirties, forties and fifties--the baby boomers--they should be concerned. We have 78 million baby boomers in this country. They are going to be doubly squeezed. They will be taking care of their aging parents and paying the high cost of educating their children, and now we would have them pay Medicare taxes for 47 years and then pay again when they are elderly. 
If we want to talk about Medicare costs, we can begin cracking down on the $23 billion of fraud in Medicare. We don't do anything by sticking it to the middle class in the middle of the night, and that is what this bill does. 
This legislation is a direct attack on the middle class and the beginning of a slippery slope for more attacks on work and savings. This is not the time, this is not the place or the way to change Medicare. It should be the starting point for a national debate on how we protect Medicare and reward work and saving. 
It is too important not to have a debate, but there has been little or no debate. We should not have spent the time this year debating contentious issues that are going nowhere. We should have spent the time debating Medicare, its solvency and a variety of alternatives to be able to educate the American people. 
Instead, we are changing the rules in the middle of the game and the middle of the night. We need Presidential leadership. We need bipartisan cooperation. We don't need a middle-of-the-night attack on the middle class that raises costs, does nothing to improve health care for our citizens and threatens the very health care for the middle class. 
I will stand sentry to protect Medicare. I will stand sentry to make sure the promises made are promises kept. And I will stand sentry for America's senior citizens. The means testing in this legislation before us breaks faith with those seniors. 
Retired seniors, as well as those nearing retirement age, have planned for that retirement with the understanding that they would have to pay about $100 in deductibles. Now they will be advised that they will have to contribute anywhere from $550 to $2,000 a year for a premium on a Government insurance program and at the same time have to pay Medigap insurance. 
When you are retired, every dollar counts, and even those with average incomes need to be able to count on every dollar. We must preserve the covenant that we established with our seniors to provide affordable accessible health insurance at old age. Out-of-sight additional fees and new income reporting requirements break those promises. What we are telling people is, if they play by the rules, they are now going to lose. 
Those who planned and saved the most are penalized for their efforts. The provision tells seniors that after a lifetime of hard work and savings, the Government is going to add to your burden when you are sick. 
So these provisions send a horrible message to seniors with higher incomes, but they also send a frightening message to every senior who depends on Medicare. If we make this change now, what does it say to seniors who fall just below the income threshold of the provision in the bill? What assurance do they have we won't be asking them to pay higher out-of-pocket expenses in the years ahead? 
I believe it is wrong to scare seniors this way, and it is unconscionable to undermine our commitment to people who depend on Medicare. 
Honoring your father and your mother is a great commandment. I think it is a great public policy. The Medicare Program must embody the values of `honor your mother and your father.' 
Mr. President, that is why I support the Kennedy-Mikulski amendment. I believe we should strike this means testing, wait for another day after we have had a national debate, a report of a national commission, and then look at the variety of tools best able to ensure the solvency of Medicare, and yet at the same time reward hard work and savings. 
I yield back such time as I might have.

Ms. MIKULSKI. How much, then, is this going to save, or is it, as we believe, just a ruse to create the principle of means testing to get what I call the slippery slope done--that really will not save very much money in Medicare, and it really does not deal with solvency of Medicare, it just lays the groundwork for additional means testing.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, 32 years ago this summer I graduated from the University of Maryland School of Social Work. And my very first job was to go out to the Baltimore neighborhoods to tell people what this new bill called Medicare was; to tell them what medical services they would be entitled to. As I went door to door to door in the streets and neighborhoods, onto the white-marbled steps of Baltimore, people's eyes opened wide. They could not believe that the United States of America had passed legislation that would provide them universal affordable health care in their old age and that it would be the next step to the Social Security commitment; that they would have in perpetuity a safety net that did not have a previous condition on it; that the premium would be affordable; that it would be undeniable. 
Thirty-two years later we are changing the rules of the game. The very people that were 30 years old then are now in their sixties. They didn't know it was going to be means tested. I respect the Finance Committee. But I will tell you that there has been no national discussion on what it means to the solvency of Medicare. 
All we are asking is strike the means testing now. Let's have an American national debate, not a time-limited rule which we agree to temporarily. But let's have a national debate. 
The Finance Committee might have studied it. It might not be a new idea to them. But I will tell you something. It is a new idea to the American people. And the middle class knows that the minute you start this class-warfare language of means testing people over $100,000 and say it is fair, button down your hatches, blue-collar workers. They are coming after you next.

Ms. MIKULSKI. The amendment Senator Wellstone and I wish to do is a version of the restoration of the Boren amendment on nursing home reimbursement to ensure safety standards and adequacy. 
</TEXT>

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Wellstone/Mikulski amendment which maintains the Boren amendment on nursing home reimbursement. 
The Boren amendment ensures an adequate daily reimbursement rate for nursing homes under Medicaid. It helps nursing homes have the funds they need to meet Federal quality and safety standards. The Wellstone/Mikulski amendment will keep this guarantee in place. 
Right now, the Boren policy is under attack. It is under attack by States. And it is under attack by Congress. If we repeal this law, States will be able to set their own rates of reimbursement to nursing homes. 
We all know the tough budget climate we are operating in. Without the Boren policy, we take away the Federal guarantee of adequate reimbursement rates. This threatens the health and safety of senior citizens. States worry about reimbursements. I'm worried about seniors. 
Without Boren, the State reimbursement rates may be too low to ensure that nursing homes can continue to provide quality care. Do we really want to return to the bad old days when senior citizens living in nursing homes faced inadequate care? Can we afford to forget the horror stories from the 1980's about living and quality conditions in some nursing homes? 
Well, the Boren amendment helped to change that. We must protect the integrity of the law. The amendment Senator Wellstone and I are offering will do that. 
Our amendment protects senior citizens living in nursing homes. And it ensures that nursing homes get an appropriate level of reimbursement. It does this by requiring States to reimburse nursing homes for the costs of daily care. 
It ensures that States will have adequate reimbursement to provide quality services. It maintains Federal Government oversight. It maintains quality standards and it will protect seniors. 
We have been through the fight to keep Federal nursing home standards. And Congress voted last year on a bipartisan basis to keep Federal standards and to maintain Federal enforcement. 
In my State of Maryland, already the reimbursement rate is very low. Maryland gets $78 per day when it costs an average of $112 to provide nursing home care. Maryland nursing homes use this reimbursement to provide room and board, around the clock medical care, three meals a day, and bathing, and feeding. You can't even get a good hotel room for that rate. We cannot have the rates fall any lower without jeopardizing patients. 
Mr. President, we must protect the Boren amendment. That is why I strongly support the Wellstone/Mikulski amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, with sadness, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable member of the U.S. Senate, the senior Senator from Arkansas, Dale Bumpers. Senator Bumpers has announced his retirement after more than 25 years in public service, including the last 22 years in the U.S. Senate. When Dale Bumpers leaves the Senate at the end of next year to return to his family and his beloved Arkansas, I will miss his leadership and his friendship tremendously. 
There has rarely been a Senator in this body with the courage of his convictions like Dale Bumpers. During his time here, he has stood up valiantly for the causes he believes in. He has been an advocate for his home State and has fought against a number of Government projects that he felt were wasteful or inefficient. His object has always been to protect the people of Arkansas and the American taxpayer. We have not always agreed with each other on the merits of every project. But I have always been able to count on Senator Bumpers' integrity, his honesty, and his good humor. 
When Senator Bumpers retires, I think my colleagues will agree that the back of the Senate Chamber will never be the same. In an institution known for its orators, Senator Bumpers is among the most accomplished of them. His passion for public debate, and his commitment to justice have been obvious to all Senators when Dale Bumpers takes the floor of the Senate. He speaks with eloquence and with feeling, whether the issue is protecting our environment or cutting corporate welfare. 
Throughout his career in public service, Senator Bumpers has remained true to his constituents by being a strong advocate for his home State of Arkansas. He knows that a Senator's ultimate responsibility is to the people of his State. As a result of his advocacy and his honesty, Arkansas voters have returned him to Washington three times with landslide re-election victories. I have no doubt that the voters of Arkansas would have made it a fourth re-election landslide if he wished. 
Senator Bumpers' insights into the issues and problems we address in the Senate, and in his Environment and Public Works Committee have made him a valuable and trusted Member of this body. Our leadership, the Senate, and most of all the State of Arkansas have greatly benefited from his service. 
I believe that I speak for all of my colleagues when I say that the departure of Senator Bumpers will leave a void in this institution. As he approaches retirement, I want to thank Dale Bumpers for his service to his country and congratulate him for his extraordinary career. I wish him excellent health and happiness in retirement, and I will truly miss him.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to rise as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 and commend the people of Israel on the 30th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem. 
Jerusalem is and always will be the capital of Israel. For thousands of years the Jewish people prayed, `next year in Jerusalem.' This prayer helped to sustain Jews even through the darkest days of the diaspora. 
After Israeli independence, Jews were forced out of Jerusalem--where they had lived for three millennia. The holy sites of Jerusalem were closed to Christians and Jews. The Jewish quarter of the old city was destroyed. But since Jerusalem was unified in 1967, it has been open to all religions for the first time in its history. 
I have visited Israel with Jews who were there for the first time. When we visited the Western Wall, I saw what it meant for them to touch the stones that their ancestors could only dream of. I saw that Jerusalem is not just a city or a capital. It is the religious and historic homeland of the Jewish people. 
Jerusalem is the capitol of Israel--though the world ignores this fact. Why is Israel the only nation that is not allowed to chose its own capital? 
There is much talk about building in Jerusalem. Well, there is a building project that I particularly look forward to. America will build its Embassy in Jerusalem by 1999. We should have moved our Embassy long ago. 
Mr. President, This year, as we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the unification of Jerusalem, let us mark this great event by reaffirming that Jerusalem is and always will be the capital of the State of Israel.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I reluctantly rise to oppose the supplemental appropriations bill currently before us. 
But first, let me once gain take this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathies to those communities and families in the Upper Midwest who have had to deal with the loss and anguish caused by the terrible flooding several weeks ago. 
I know all Marylanders join me in extending our thoughts and prayers to everyone in the Midwest. 
Like many of my colleagues, I had hoped for a quick and speedy passage of this critically needed assistance to the disaster victims. I know they are counting on us to help them get back on their feet--to help them rebuild their homes and businesses. 
I am therefore deeply troubled by the fact that what should have been a speedy, nonpartisan targeted relief bill has instead turned into yet another nasty partisan battle that is designed to divide us and provoke a veto from the President. 
I have several major concerns with the supplemental, the first of which is the census sampling amendment that prohibits the Census Bureau from using funds to conduct statistical sampling in the year 2000 census. While to many this is a dry, academic topic, it impacts all Americans on a daily basis. 
In addition to being the manner for determining representation in the Congress, the census has become the basis for which billions of dollars in Federal assistance are allocated. Programs such a low-energy assistance, community block development grants, and other vital programs to Maryland for transportation, housing, and education all rely on accurate census data. 
This amendment does not follow the congressionally sought recommendation of this Nation's top statistical experts who advise using statistical sampling to get accurate data. Instead this provision would result in an undercount of many of the Nation's citizens. Especially hard hit would be those in rural areas and the inner city poor. That's wrong. 
There is no reason to play games with the census, particularly when so many people's lives are at stake. Everybody counts in America, and everybody should be counted. 
Mr. President, I am also very concerned by the continued inclusion in this disaster relief package of what has artfully been called the Shutdown Prevention Act. 
Nobody knows the pain of a Government shutdown better than me and the Marylanders I represent. When the last shutdown occurred, numerous people from across my State felt the shock and dislocation of those events. 
When I visited the Government agencies that had to remain open, I saw the frustration on the faces of the workers and the financial hardship it caused for all Federal employees. 
Let there be no mistake, I do not want another shutdown and will do everything I can to prevent it. But this bill is not the answer. 
Instead, this bill which provides for a permanent continuing resolution, is nothing more than a partisan exercise designed to hamstring Congress from exercising its constitutional role in the legislative process. 
If we fail to enact our appropriations bills on time, the continuing resolution contained in this bill simply prevents Congress from increasing spending on such crucial items as cancer research, crime fighting, and education. It also hampers Congress in cutting unnecessary spending and eliminating waste. 
Lastly, I am disappointed by the method we have chosen to pay for this bill. By taking over $3 billion in unobligated funds from HUD's section 8 public housing program to pay for FEMA's disaster relief fund, we are simply robbing Peter to pay Paul. 
We cannot keep on raiding this program to pay for disaster funding. We must find a new way to pay for emergency supplemental appropriations bills because these disasters are not going to end. 
We could be facing even more expensive disasters in the near future. Are we going to continually rob one or two agencies to pay for these bills? 
I believe we need a new system or a new arrangement to deal with these types of disasters--a new system that is off-budget. 
Mr. President, because of the census sampling amendment, the continuing resolution, and the way in which we have chosen to pay for the bill, I am forced to oppose this bill. 
It is my sincere hope that in the future we can avoid these partisan fights over disaster relief bills and find a more equitable way to pay for them.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the budget resolution. I support this resolution for two reasons. First, it continues the progress we have made since 1993 in moving toward a balanced budget. Second, it protects priorities which are vital to our Nation's future. 
It is not a perfect plan. There are parts of it that give me serious pause. I am especially concerned by the deep cuts in Medicare. I know that this budget resolution only provides a blueprint for other committees to follow. So, I reserve the right to vote against the final Medicare package if the cuts threaten health care for our senior citizens. 
With this resolution, we are finally taking the historic step of balancing the Federal budget for the first time since 1969. In 1993, I was proud to support President Clinton's economic plan. Since that plan was enacted, our deficit has been reduced from $290 billion to less than $70 billion. 
The 1993 vote was strong medicine. But it was the right medicine for our economy. Today, we have an opportunity to finish the job we began in 1993. We can adopt this resolution which will bring us to a balanced budget by the year 2002. 
But, unlike previous attempts to balance the budget, this resolution protects crucial investments in our future. Balancing the budget must be based on principles. First and foremost, it must meet families' day-to-day needs. 
I believe this resolution succeeds in putting families and children first. It makes major investments in education--from adding 1 million children to the Head Start Program to making it possible for millions of students to receive a college education. 
This resolution expands health care coverage to 5 million uninsured children. I want to do more. This resolution still leaves another 5 million children with no health insurance. I am supporting the Kennedy-Hatch CHILD bill which would make sure that every child has access to immunizations, early detection screening, and basic health care. I view the commitment made in this budget resolution to children's health as a downpayment on the job. I hope we will finish the job by enacting the CHILD bill later this year. 
The bill before us will continue our progress in making our neighborhoods safe. It ensures that the programs of the 1994 crime bill, which have been so effective in bring down crime rates, will be continued. 
I am particularly pleased that the budget resolution protects the violent crime reduction trust fund, including the community policing or COPS Program. The COPS Program has already put over 1,200 new police officers on the streets in my State of Maryland. 
Under this budget agreement, environmental protection will also be strengthened. It ensures that another 500 Superfund sites can be cleaned up by the end of 2000, and provides funding to help communities clean up brownfield areas so that they can be redeveloped. 
Under this balanced budget agreement, we will also be taking important steps to move people from welfare to work and to provide tax relief for working families. It will enable us to provide help for those who practice self help. 
As the Finance Committee begins putting together the tax component outlined in this budget agreement, I hope they make tax relief for middle income families their priority. I want to enact capital gains relief. I think we owe it to those who have invested in their community through purchasing and maintaining a home. They should be able to realize the full gain on their investment, and not have it taken away through capital gains taxes. 
I hope we can do something to provide capital gains relief for other types of investments as well. I believe that the longer you hold an investment, the less you should pay in capital gains. That rewards those who invest in our economy for the long run, without rewarding those who are just out to make a fast buck. 
I want us to have estate tax relief, so that a car dealer in Frederick can pass on the business to the next generation, or a small family farm in western Maryland or the Eastern Shore can stay in the family. 
I hope the Finance Committee will put together a tax package that puts families first. If the tax package is unfairly tilted toward the well-to-do, I will oppose it. 
Although I will support this budget resolution, I must be clear that there are parts of it that give me great pause. I am particularly troubled by the $115 billion in cuts in the Medicare Program. If we were given the opportunity to vote separately on each of the major components of this package, I would oppose the Medicare component. 
In the last Congress, when the majority party was attempting to push through $270 billion in cuts to the Medicare Program to provide tax cuts for the wealthy, I opposed them. I said at the time that we did not have a $270 billion solvency problem in the Medicare Program, rather we had a $89 billion solvency problem. I was joined by the majority of my Democratic colleagues in that point. 
So to see a resolution which calls for $115 billion in cuts to Medicare is of deep concern to me. I acknowledge this is much better than plans that were before us over the last 2 years. However, I am still concerned about the impact on seniors and on health care providers of this magnitude of cuts. 
I realize that the budget resolution does not cut a single dollar from the Medicare Program. It only provides a guideline for the authorizing committee to follow. We are a long way from making any actual changes in Medicare. So I hope that the Finance Committee will exercise extreme care in crafting the Medicare piece of the budget reconciliation bill. I believe we can ensure the solvency of Medicare without creating a financial burden for seniors or providers. 
Let me acknowledge one final area of concern. America owes a special debt to our veterans. We have a sacred commitment to honor all of our promises to them. I want to ensure that we provide adequately for veterans' health care. 
I am pleased that we passed an amendment to express the sense of the Senate that we must provide sufficient funding for veterans programs and benefits. This amendment includes language to urge that third party payments--that is, payments from private insurers--be used only to supplement, not supplant veterans health care funding. It makes clear that the Senate intends to keep our faith with America's veterans. I won't stand for anything less than that. 
Despite these reservations, I will support this resolution. It plots our course toward a balanced budget and puts families and children first. I believe this budget resolution will make a real difference in the lives of working Americans, and I will support it as a framework for future action.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment offered by my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, to help rebuild our Nation's schools. 
This amendment would ensure that any budget agreement that we reach will include funding for school construction. I believe that we must ensure that we meet the needs of our local communities to help them upgrade the Nation's schools. 
I am an original cosponsor of S. 456, the Partnership to Rebuild America's Schools Act. This bill would provide $5 billion over 4 years to subsidize up to 50 percent of the interest or other financing costs for school construction. 
These funds would help States and localities leverage scarce resources to help upgrade, repair, and build new schools. 
In my State of Maryland, school enrollment is at an all time high. Many of the counties in Maryland like Prince Georges and Montgomery are rapidly expanding and the school districts are struggling to keep pace. 
I hear from parents, students, and teachers about the need to upgrade the schools. Our children must be in environments which are conducive to learning. Over one-third of the schools in Maryland are in desperate need of repair. 
Under S. 456, Maryland would receive approximately $57.9 million in Federal funds to support $231.6 million for school construction. Baltimore public schools would receive $31.4 million. 
I believe that funding school construction has to be a priority for our Nation. Children cannot learn in schools with leaky roofs, poor ventilation, crumbling walls, and other problems. This problem is especially acute in rural areas and inner cities. Many of these schools fail to meet even minimum local health and safety codes. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Our Nation's school children deserve no less.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I wish to rise to express my strong support for the 
Kennedy-Hatch amendment on children's health. I cannot think of any more important issue that faces our country. The health of our children must be a national priority. This amendment will make sure that that happens. It will expand health insurance to cover America's uninsured children. Our country has failed to meet the health care needs of these children. And we all know the statistics. More than 10 million children do not have health insurance; that is one out of every seven children. 
In my own home State of Maryland, I am deeply concerned about what the situation is. One in five children is uninsured. Almost 200,000 children in Maryland alone lack health insurance. 
Most of the uninsured children are from families with parents who get up and work every day. These are families who are doing the right thing to be able to support their family and yet they also want to be able to ensure that their children have health care, where parents are working 40 hours a week, often at what I call the varicose-vein jobs. They get up, they stand on their feet, they are the checkout woman at a grocery store, clerk, or they are some man out there working as a part-time landscaper assistant, sweating, breaking his back, and in very difficult circumstances, to put food on the table, a roof over their heads. But they live in fear every time one of their children has the sniffles, that those sniffles could lead to pneumonia and they do not have health care. 
I have had grown men who were veterans, who were so upset that they had health care and their children did not. They support veterans' health care, and so do I. But those very same dads would say, `Let me be a dad. And let me be able to support my own children.' 
I am reminded of a case in southern Maryland where the dad is a self-employed carpenter. His youngest child has a heart disease. He is making $40,000 a year. But in order to get health insurance, it will cost $9,000 a year. That is almost one-fourth of their family income. The wife stays at home to care for this child, to be the backup, to make sure that that health condition does not deteriorate into a permanent cardiac disability. Should they go without health insurance? Should the mom go back to work? They should not have these melancholy choices to make. 
That is why we support health insurance for our children, and not only for the children who are acutely ill but we want to have health insurance for children so they can be immunized by the time they are two, have early detection and screening as they get ready to go into kindergarten or elementary school to make sure they are learning ready, that they know whether they need eyeglasses or they need hearing aids or whether they have undetected juvenile diabetes, all these kinds of things. 
I can think of no more important health investment than to have a healthy start for children. And I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues, at the fantastic, bipartisan President's summit on voluntarism, one of the goals established by Colin Powell, one of the five goals to get our kids ready for the future is to make sure they have a healthy start. 
I say to my colleagues, this amendment would be a very important step in being able to do that. 
I thank the Senate for its attention. 
I yield back such time as I might not have consumed.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Santorum bill. I oppose this bill for three reasons. First of all, it will not stop a single abortion from occurring. Second, it is unconstitutional. Finally, it does not provide any protection for a woman whose health is grievously threatened by the pregnancy. 
I want to ban all post-viability abortions, not a particular procedure. I believe the only time an abortion should be allowed after the point of viability is when the woman's life is threatened or her health is at serious risk of substantial impairment. 
I supported the Daschle alternative. The Daschle alternative would have meant fewer abortions. It banned all abortions once a fetus had achieved viability. In other words, once a fetus could survive outside the womb--with or without life support--a woman could not obtain an abortion. 
It provided only two exceptions: first, when the woman's life was threatened by continuing the pregnancy, and second, when she was at risk of grievous injury to her health. If the Daschle alternative had been adopted there would be fewer abortions. 
The bill before us bans one procedure. It does not ban one single abortion. It bans a method of abortion. It enables a doctor to choose any other abortion procedure--even ones that might cause a greater health risk to the woman. So no abortions would be stopped by this bill. 
I want to support a bill that is constitutionally acceptable. The bill before us fails the test of constitutionality. The Supreme Court has always insisted that prior to the point of viability, the woman's right to abortion is constitutionally protected. This bill infringes on that right by banning a procedure even before viability. 
The Supreme Court has also held that in any legislation restricting abortion, the woman's life and health must be protected. A physician must place the woman's health as the paramount concern. There can be no trade off of the woman's life and health for that of the fetus. 
By refusing to include any exception for instances where the woman's health is at risk, H.R. 1122 is constitutionally unacceptable. The Daschle alternative, on the other hand, was respectful of the requirements of the Constitution. It focused only on abortion procedures after the point of viability. And it ensured that a woman's health could be protected. 
I want to support legislation that provides for the health of the woman. I know that health of the woman is viewed by some as merely a loophole. But even those who hold that view must acknowledge that there are medical crises that arise during pregnancy that could cause profound harm to a woman's health. 
Conditions like severe hypertension or peripartal cardiomyopathy are caused by the pregnancy itself. These can lead to organ failure or put a woman at risk of cardiac failure. Other conditions, like leukemia or breast cancer, cannot receive the aggressive treatment they require so long as the pregnancy continues. 
I don't believe that anyone would argue that these are minor health problems. Yet the Santorum bill does not allow any health exception for women facing these major health threats. 
The Daschle alternative, on the other hand, did provide a carefully crafted exception for the woman's health. It said that a physician could abort a viable fetus when the pregnancy would `threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health.' Grievous injury was narrowly defined to include only the most debilitating problems caused by the pregnancy itself and cases where the pregnancy caused an inability to treat a life-threatening condition. It required that such conditions be medically diagnosable, and ruled out any condition for which termination of the pregnancy was not medically indicated. 
This was not loophole shopping. This was a serious, careful, intellectually rigorous effort to deal with the realities of women's health and women's lives. 
I was proud to support the Daschle alternative. I was disappointed that it did not receive broader support. It would have prevented abortions. It was respectful of the Constitution. It safeguarded women's health. 
I am disappointed that the American Medical Association has chosen to endorse this bill. I am particularly troubled that their decision seems to be based not on what is best for women's health but on what is best for doctors. The changes they sought in the bill were designed only to protect a physician from legal endangerment. 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, on the other hand, endorsed the Daschle alternative. They represent 38,000 physicians who are experts in women's health and issues related to pregnancy. They endorsed the Daschle alternative because it would have provided a meaningful ban while assuring women's health is protected. 
Let me say that I do not for one moment question the sincerity of those who have called and written me in support of H.R. 1122. They want to stop abortions, and I respect the depth of their convictions. 
But let me also say that if this bill is enacted, it will be a hollow victory. I believe the Supreme Court will reject this bill as unconstitutional. In the end, even if it were somehow to pass constitutional muster, it will not stop a single abortion. It will merely divert physicians to other abortion procedures. 
So this bill will not save lives. It will not save the lives and health of women. And it will not save the lives of fetuses. It is a hollow victory indeed. 
I will oppose this measure.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Daschle alternative, and I do so because of three reasons: No. 1, it preserves Roe versus Wade; No. 2, it prohibits all postviability abortions; and No. 3, it provides an exception for the life and the health of the mother, which is both intellectually rigorous and compassionate at the same time. 
The Daschle substitute respects the Supreme Court's ruling in the Roe decision. When the Court decided Roe, it was faced with the task of defining when does life begin. Theologians and scientists differ on this. People of good will and good conscience differ on this. So the Supreme Court used viability as its standard. Once a fetus is viable, it is presumed not only to have a body, but a mind, a spirit and a persona that has standing in our society and in our courts. Therefore, it has standing under the law as a person. 
The Daschle alternative respects that key holding of Roe. It says after the point of viability, no woman should be able to abort a viable fetus. There would only be two exceptions: to immediately save her life, and the other may be when the woman faces a serious and debilitating threat to her health. 
The bill before us, H.R. 1122, as proposed by the Senator from Pennsylvania, simply bans a particular abortion technique at any point in the pregnancy. Because it would ban the use of a technique during previability, it would violate the Supreme Court's standard on viability. Should this language be passed, in all probability, it would be struck down by the courts, and the proponents of the legislation do know this. 
The Daschle alternative bans all postviability abortions. It does not create loopholes by allowing other procedures to be used. Therefore, this Daschle alternative is superior to H.R. 1122 because it does ban abortions, it doesn't just ban a procedure, it bans all abortions after the point of viability. Therefore, it is good public policy, it is good public health and also will stand up to the test of the Supreme Court. 
I believe there is no Senator who thinks a woman should abort a viable fetus for frivolous or nonmedical reasons. It does not matter what procedure is used. It is wrong and we know it. Therefore, the Daschle alternative bans those abortions. 
However, on the other hand, H.R. 1122 does not stop one single abortion. For those who think they support this approach, know that it is unconstitutional and is, therefore, both hollow and ineffective. 
Let us be clear. A vote for the underlying bill will be both hollow and ineffective. It will attempt to ban a particular procedure, but allows doctors to simply go to another procedure. 
The Daschle alternative does ban abortions. It says that a woman cannot have an abortion once the fetus is viable. We talk about then `What is viable?' It means surviving outside of the womb with or without life support. Medical advances are the ones that will determine what enables a fetus to be viable. 
Let me tell you what else I like about the Daschle alternative. The health of the mother is rigorously, intellectually defined, but it is also compassionate. Under the Daschle alternative, the only time an abortion would be allowed--other than saving the life of the mother--is when the woman faces a medical crisis that is grave and severe. And it defines that as circumstances that `threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health.' 
But I want to be very clear in this. The Daschle alternative does not create a gaping loophole with its health exception. We are not loophole shopping when we insist that the Constitution requires, and the reality of women's lives demands, an exception for women's health. 
The health exception in the Daschle alternative has been carefully developed. I know that the Senator has consulted with medical ethicists, physicians, as well as constitutional scholars. It is specific and not vague. It is meant to cover only the most severe types of medical conditions. 
What kind would they be? Some of these conditions are caused or aggravated by the pregnancy itself. For instance, issues like severe hypertension or preeclampsia, which occurs in 5 to 10 percent of pregnancies. In severe instances, the woman would face severe renal failure, kidney failure, liver failure, and ultimately could die. 
Other women find themselves at risk for serious heart damage as a result of peripartal cardiomyophy. These women have no previous history of heart disease. It is the pregnancy itself that puts them at risk for cardiac failure. Would anyone argue that this is not a profound health crisis? 
There are other complications. Women with existing hypertension often find their condition dangerously aggravated by the pregnancy. Complications of hypertension occur in 10 to 40 percent of these patients. These women are at risk for organ failure, seizures, or even death. 
Women who suffer from diabetes may find their condition exacerbated during pregnancy, so severe that it could lead to blindness or amputations. And in some instances, where the woman is carrying a fetus with severe anomalies, she is at risk of uterine rupture and the loss of future fertility. 
These are real, undeniable severe medical complications. While they are rare, they do occur. Senator Daschle's alternative addresses this reality. 
It recognizes that to deny these women access to the abortion that could save their lives and health would be unconscionable. When the continuation of the pregnancy is causing these sorts of profound health problems, a woman's doctor must have every tool available to respond. 
There are also cases where a life-endangering condition, unrelated to the pregnancy, arises and cannot be properly treated because of the pregnancy. 
For instance, in the course of her pregnancy, if a woman is defined as having breast cancer, leukemia or some other form of cancer, she could not have her chemotherapy or radiation because it would cause profound fetal mutation. 
Doctors are faced with choices. Mothers and fathers will be faced with choices. The question is, who decides? I do not think it should be done on the floor of the U.S. Congress by politicians. I believe the decisions should be made in a clinical situation between a doctor, the mother, and her husband. I support the Daschle alternative because it would provide this health exception and allow the physician and the family affected to make the decision that is medically appropriate to address very grave health situations that a woman may face. 
That is why the Daschle alternative is so important. That is why the Daschle alternative is critical to passage. For those who are serious about banning postviability abortions, the Daschle alternative is the only alternative. For those who really want to seek common ground, the Daschle alternative is compassionate, intellectually rigorous. It enables physicians to determine what is medically necessary. 
I have been troubled by this issue ever since I came to the House of Representatives more than 20 years ago. I am associated as being a pro-choice U.S. Congresswoman, and now Senator. What does pro-choice mean? It is not that I am for abortion. I do not believe that abortion is an unlimited right. But I believe it is the woman, in consultation with the physician and the family affected, who should decide. 
Through the grace of God, I have been granted the faith of being a Roman Catholic. I will be eternally grateful for that gift of faith. But with that gift came two other gifts, one of hope and one of compassion. I hope to live as a Catholic; I hope to be able to die a Catholic. I feel that the Daschle alternative gives us an option that is not only constitutionally defensible, but is medically and morally defensible. And I hope that finally we can bring this debate and this discussion to the end. 
Last year, we voted 52 times on the subject of abortion. Was the public served by it? Were women served? I don't know. I do not think so. So, please, let us take politicians out of this conversation. Let us put doctors back in because if we truly cannot trust the decisions in the medical profession, then I do not know who we can trust. You ask the American people, who do you trust more, your doctor or your politician? I do not think they would debate as long as we will be debating this issue. 
Before closing, let me just extend my deep appreciation for the work our Democratic leader has done on this issue. He has been heroic, faithful and determined. 
He has reached out to every Member of the Senate. He has consulted a wide range of medical professionals, lawyers, and legal and ethical scholars. He has been absolutely committed to finding a solution that is passable, signable, and constitutional. I believe he has succeeded. 
So I thank him. And I compliment his excellent staff, Laura Petrou, Caroline Fredrickson, and Amy Sullivan, who have done truly outstanding work in developing the alternative before us. 
Mr. President, today we have the opportunity to do something very important. We can move beyond soundbites and politics, and do something real, something which I know reflects the views of the American people. 
We can pass the Daschle alternative. We can say that we value life and we value our Constitution. We can make clear that a viable fetus should not be aborted. We can say that we want to save women's lives and women's health. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Daschle alternative. 
I respect people on the other side who have differing views. But I am also concerned that there might be a lack of clarity about some of those issues. 
Before I yield the floor, I wonder if the distinguished Democratic leader would yield for two questions, if he might? 
There is some question whether the woman's physician would be allowed--the alternative has been criticized because it allows the woman's physician to make the medical judgment regarding the woman's need. 
Could you tell me what procedures your alternative provides so that a physician does not abuse the strict standards provided for in your measure, and what enforcement tools there would be so we could trust the doctors?

I think that spells that out. 
Now, one of the reasons I support your alternative is because I truly believe it will prevent abortion, particularly postviability abortion. 
Can you assure me that your alternative--assure those who also want to ban all postviability abortions that your alternative would do so?

Ms. MIKULSKI. Many States have enacted their own laws on postviability abortion. My own State of Maryland has a law that bans postviability abortions. It was approved by the voters of Maryland in a referendum. The Maryland law says a postviability abortion is only allowed when it `is necessary to protect the life or health of the woman; or the fetus is affected by genetic defect or serious deformity or abnormality.' Other States have even more far-reaching bans. 
How does the bipartisan alternative affect Maryland law, which the people of Maryland endorsed through referendum?

Ms. MIKULSKI. The bipartisan alternative has a very narrowly drawn definition of the health situations under which a postviability abortion would be allowed. It says that the physician must certify that `continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health.' 
Does this mean that there are no situations when a woman with a profound mental health problem would be permitted a postviability abortion under your bill?

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Consumer Product Safety Commission for the kick off of its Recall Round-up campaign. The Recall Roundup is a national effort to retrieve all hazardous products that have been recalled, but may still be in people's homes. 
Each year the Commission coordinates approximately 300 recalls of defective or dangerous products. The task of getting these products out of American homes has been a difficult one. 
The existence of faulty products has been the cause of serious injury and even death to children in the United States. This is unacceptable. That's why I am pleased to report that in my own State, Maryland Lt. Governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend on April 16 announced the State's plans to join the Commission in the Recall Roundup.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the supplemental appropriations bill but do so with great hesitation. 
Like all of us here today, I want to extend my sympathies to the communities and families of the Upper Midwest who have experienced the terrible flooding over the past several weeks. 
It brings back vivid memories of the flooding that hit Western Maryland last year and I know all Marylanders join me in extending our thoughts and prayers to everyone in the Midwest. 
Like many of my colleagues, I was hoping for quick consideration of this important legislation so we could speed relief to disaster victims. They are counting on us to help them get back on their feet--to help them rebuild their homes and businesses. 
I am so disappointed that what should have been a speedy, nonpartisan targeted relief bill has turned into another nasty partisan battle that is designed to divide us and provoke a veto from the President. 
I am particularly alarmed by the inclusion in this package of what is artfully called the Shutdown Prevention Act. 
Nobody knows the pain of a government shutdown better than me and the Marylanders I represent. When the last shutdown occurred, I visited Government agencies that had to remain open. 
I saw the frustration on the faces of the workers and the financial hardship it caused for all Federal employees. 
I do not want another shutdown and will do everything I can to prevent it. But, the revised bill now provides for a permanent continuing resolution which is nothing more than a partisan trick. 
If we fail to enact our appropriations bills on time, the continuing resolution contained in this bill will prevent Congress from increasing spending for cancer research, crime fighting and education. It will also prevent Congress from cutting spending and eliminating waste. 
In addition, I am disturbed by the way in which we have chosen to pay for this bill. This bill takes over $3 billion in unobligated funds from HUD's section 8 public housing program to pay for FEMA's disaster relief fund. 
I do not believe we should be robbing Peter to pay Paul. Eventually, Peter will be broke. 
The projected budget problems with regard to the section 8 program are well known. In fiscal year 1998, section 8 renewals will cost $10.2 billion. That is a $7 billion increase over the fiscal year 1997 funding level. 
We will need the unobligated funds to pay for the section 8 renewals in fiscal year 1998. We should not be raiding the program to pay for disaster funding. 
We must find a new way to pay for emergency supplemental appropriations bills because these disasters are not going to end. 
We could be facing even more expensive disasters in the near future. Are we going to continually rob one or two agencies to pay for these bills? 
I believe we need a new system or a new arrangement to deal with these type of disasters--a new system that is off-budget. 
Mr. President, I am forced to oppose this bill because of the continuing resolution and the way in which we have chosen to pay for the bill. As a result of the continuing resolution, the bill is likely to be vetoed by the President. I hope in the future we can avoid partisan fights over disaster relief bills and find a more equitable way to pay for them.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate Resolution 78, which would designate April 30, 1997 as `National Erase the Hate and Eliminate Racism Day.' I am proud to be a cosponsor and am pleased we have acted today to pass this resolution. 
While I believe it is important to set aside a day for special focus on fighting hatred and bigotry, this cannot be a 1 day event. That is why this resolution calls on every American to practice tolerance and to take a strong stand against hate crimes and violence in their communities each and every day. 
I commend my colleagues, Senators Baucus and Burns, for introducing this important legislation. This legislation will bring awareness to what is an unsettling trend in this country--the increasing incidents of hate crimes and the growing occurrences of discrimination. 
I am greatly disturbed that hate crimes are on the rise. We saw evidence of that rise in the burning of African-American churches around the country, which apparently was motivated by racism. We saw it in the bombing of the Federal building in Oklahoma City, which was reportedly motivated by anti-government hatred. 
We've read and seen reports in the media about hate crimes. We've witnessed the violent attacks against individuals because of their race, gender, sexual orientation or their beliefs. It's evident in the increasing number of individuals in this country who have joined fringe groups like militias and other hate groups. We've also seen it in the growing anti-immigrant sentiment in our country. As the granddaughter of immigrants, I find this particularly repugnant. 
I recently met with a group of Asian-Pacific-American community leaders from my State of Maryland. They shared with me very compelling stories about discrimination that is faced each and every day by Asian-Pacific-Americans. Unfortunately, I hear this all too often when I meet with minority groups. 
Asian-Pacific-Americans in Maryland are concerned about their right to participate in the democratic process. They shared with me their fears that their right to engage in campaign electoral activities is being questioned, simply because of a few cases of alleged campaign fundraising abuses purportedly committed by members of the Asian-Pacific-American community. 
I have seen reports that indicate hate-motivated attacks on Asian-Pacific-Americans have grown more than 38 percent since 1993. I find that appalling. Violence against Asian-Pacific-Americans, as with other minority groups, is bred by stereotypes, discrimination, and tensions in communities. 
I am concerned about what is happening in our country. It's inconceivable that more than 30 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, we are still grappling with racism in this country. 
This plague of hatred has spread and reached our youth. A young African-American boy in Chicago was brutally attacked recently by a group of white teenagers. What happened in Chicago is one of the most brutal acts we have witnessed in recent years. It is even more appalling that the perpetrators were young teenagers. 
We need to educate our youth on tolerance. We need to teach them not to hate and not to discriminate. We need to start this process early. 
My State of Maryland is becoming more ethnically diverse. I meet with minority groups in my State often and they share the same concerns. They are concerned about the climate of hate in our society. They fear discrimination in schools and in the work force. And most importantly, they are concerned about their children and their children's future. If this plague of hate continues in our country, what kind of future are we ensuring for our most precious resource--our children? 
We have to change the negative attitudes and perceptions in this country about minorities. We have to eliminate the persistence of violent hate crimes against racial, ethnic, and religious groups. 
To succeed in making our society free of hate, racism, and discrimination, we have to take a stand that we will not tolerate random acts of hate, subtle and overt racism, and wide-spread discrimination. I am committed to doing my part. This is a commitment that has to be made by everyone. 
I believe that this resolution will send the message that we will no longer tolerate hate and discrimination in this country. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

I am so disappointed that what should have been a speedy, nonpartisan targeted relief bill has turned into another nasty partisan battle. 
I am greatly concerned about the many extraneous provisions that have been wedged into this bill. The provisions are designed to inflame and divide us and to provoke a veto from the President. 
They make it so much more difficult to get assistance to the people in flood ravaged communities who are counting on us. I am particularly alarmed by the inclusion in this package of what is artfully called the Shutdown Prevention Act. 
Nobody knows the pain of a Government shutdown better than me and the Marylanders I represent. When the last shutdown occurred, I visited Government agencies that had to remain open. 
I saw the frustration on the faces of the workers and the financial hardship it caused for all Federal employees. 
I do not want another shutdown and will do everything I can to prevent it. But, the revised bill now provides for a permanent continuing resolution which is nothing more than a partisan trick. 
It is designed to lock in deep cuts to important programs under the cover of preventing a Government shutdown. I am opposed to this provision and urge my colleagues to oppose it. 
In addition, I am disturbed by the way in which we have chosen to pay for this bill. This bill takes $3.6 billion in unobligated funds from HUD's section 8 public housing program to pay for FEMA's disaster relief fund. 
I do not believe we should be robbing Peter to pay Paul. 
Eventually, Peter will be broke. 
The projected budget problems with regard to the section 8 program are well known. 
In fiscal year 1998, section 8 renewals will cost $10.2 billion. That is a $7 billion increase over the fiscal year 1997 funding level. 
We will need the unobligated funds to pay for the section 8 renewals in fiscal year 1998. We should not be raiding the program to pay for disaster funding. 
I am pleased that of the $5.8 billion in unobligated section 8 funds, $2.2 billion will be saved to cover fiscal year 1998 section 8 renewal costs. However, as the budget estimates show, we will need every dollar we can find to cover the huge increase in section 8 costs next year. 
The VA/HUD Subcommittee cannot serve as the ATM machine for the rest of the committee. If we are going to pay for emergency disasters, one subcommittee should not bear a disproportionate share of the burden. 
We must find a new way to pay for emergency supplemental appropriations bills. These disasters are not going to end. 
We could be facing even more expensive disasters in the near future. Are we going to continually robe the VA/HUD account to pay for these bills? 
I believe we need a new system or a new arrangement to deal with these type of disasters--a new system that is off-budget. 
I wanted to support this bill because it is so important to the families and communities who need help. However, the changes that were added at the last minute make it impossible for me to do so. I hope in the future we can avoid partisan fights over disaster relief bills and find a more equitable way to pay for them.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I join my colleagues Senators Kennedy and Murray in cosponsoring this important new initiative. 
The goal of this legislation is to launch a campaign to ensure that every child in our Nation can read independently by the end of the third grade. I believe that this is a worthwhile goal, which will have a wide-ranging impact on our Nation. 
We need to help our young children learn to read. It's the responsibility not only of parents but of schools, communities, civic groups, libraries, and business leaders. Some 40 percent of all children are now reading below the accepted level on national reading assessments. 
This is a national crisis. Tens of thousands of students cannot read at the basic level. If students can't read well by the third grade, their chances for later success fall dramatically. These same students are likely to drop out of school; they will have problems with delinquency; and they will have fewer job options. 
I believe that the America Reads initiative will go a long way in providing much needed resources to parents, schools, and State and local communities to help our children learn to read. 
This bill would establish a corps of 1 million volunteer tutors and give States additional resources to hire 30,000 reading specialists to coordinate the corps volunteer tutors who will work with teachers, principals, and librarians to help children succeed in reading. 
I support mobilizing thousands of volunteers, but I also believe that the training and screening must be adequate, especially when we place anyone in our Nation's classrooms. These are issues that my colleagues and I will be addressing. 
We also want to help parents. This bill establishes Parents as First Teachers challenge grants, which invests in success by supporting 
effective and proven local efforts that assist parents who request help to better work with their children. 
The President has also called upon colleges and universities across the country to dedicate half of their new work study funds to support 100,000 college students to serve as reading tutors. Already hundreds of colleges and universities across the country have pledged to have their work study students help children learn to read. In my State of Maryland, Anne Arundel Community College, Bowie State University, Frostburg State University, and the University of Maryland at College Park have all committed to the America Reads initiative. 
We also want accountability. This legislation will use the improvements in the National Assessment of Educational Progress [NAEP] to provide an annual measure of the reading performance of 4th graders and their progress toward meeting the reading challenge. 
Both the Corporation for National Service and the Department of Education will oversee and manage this program. The Corporation for National Service has the expertise to pull together the AmeriCorps volunteers and has the infrastructure in place to help mobilize the volunteers. The Department of Education has the knowledge and resources to really make this program accountable. 
I support utilizing the resources that we already have in place with AmeriCorps. I know that thousands of AmeriCorps volunteers across the country are already in the schools tutoring children. In Maryland, AmeriCorps volunteers are already in public schools tutoring and mentoring students. 
And, companies too are leading the way with innovative methods of teaching our children to read. Sylvan Learning Center, which is headquartered in my State of Maryland, is a company that has been having great success with its methods to help children learn to read. Sylvan operates tutoring centers across the country. The centers have produced measurable results with children. The centers are community-based facilities. The student to teacher ratio never exceeds 3:1. Sylvan's approach consists of individualized instruction, variety, a creative 
motivational system, and parent and teacher involvement. It is an approach that works and can be one of the models that we use for the America Reads Program. 
Why does this approach work? Because specialists can tailor a program to meet an individual student's needs. In many overcrowded classrooms across our country, it's simply impossible for a teacher in charge of 30 or 40 students to give one student who's having problems extra attention. 
I don't believe that America Reads is a substitute for in-school instruction nor is it a substitute for parental involvement. 
What we're talking about providing is individualized after school, weekend, and summer reading tutoring for nearly 3 million children a year from kindergarten through third grade [K-3] who want and need extra help. This will supplement the learning that is taking place during classroom hours. What's more important is that this tutoring will take place at no cost to parents and students. 
I know that there has been criticism about having a literacy program directly aimed at children in K-3. I have to disagree with this criticism. Schools cannot do it alone. Many public schools simply do not have the resources to give students the one-on-one attention they need. 
We have to launch a large-scale effort to tackle our Nation's youth literacy problem. I believe we need to mobilize and train volunteers to come into the schools to help our children learn to read. I believe we need to hire reading specialists to help our Nation's children. Teachers cannot do it alone. And parents need our help. 
When 40 percent of our Nation's children cannot read on level by the third grade, we must ask ourselves as a nation what we're doing wrong and how we can correct it. This is a widespread problem that crosses gender, racial, and religious lines. 
As the Nation begins to enter the 21st century, we cannot have our young people--our future--lagging behind in basic skills. This affects our Nation as a whole. It affects our Nation's productivity. It affects our 
work force. When these children become adults, they will not have the basic skills needed to survive. 
Reading is an ongoing activity. And, if we want our children to succeed, if we want to promote work force readiness, and if we want to raise academic standards in our schools, then we have to reach our children in their early stages of development. 
I hear from teachers, administrators, and counselors in my State about the dismal crisis in public schools. Many children come to school from impoverished backgrounds. Many children come to school either abused themselves or the witness to domestic abuse in the home. With all of these obstacles, it's even more difficult for teachers to teach and for students to learn to read. 
That's why I am supporting this bold, new initiative. The idea is to use the resources that our Nation already has--libraries, volunteers, students, businesses, and civic organizations--to help our most precious resource--our youth. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. This international treaty is our best hope to end the use of lethal chemical weapons. It will protect Americans by making it harder for terrorists to produce chemical weapons and it will protect our soldiers on the battlefield. This treaty will make America and the world more secure. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemicals as weapons. Each and every nation that signs this treaty becomes an ally in the fight against chemical weapons used by terrorists or by outlaw states. If we don't ratify this treaty, America will join countries like Libya and Iraq who refuse to join the worldwide effort to end the use of chemical weapons. I can't speak for my colleagues, but I know that this Senator does not want the United States to be aligned with those terrorist states. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention is not a liberal or a conservative document. It is not a Democratic or a Republican document. It was negotiated by the Reagan and Bush administrations and it is supported by the Clinton administration. It is in the tradition of a nonpartisan foreign policy. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention was made in America. It is inconceivable that we--the world's only superpower--would refuse to ratify a Convention that we were instrumental in drafting. 
Of course no treaty can ever eliminate every threat. That is why the United States must continue to maintain our strong chemical weapons defense program. At the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, scientists and technicians are developing better ways to protect our troops from the effects of chemical weapons. This important work must continue. 
In addition, our intelligence agencies, like the National Security Agency, must continue to provide the kind of information that prevents the use of chemical weapons. The National Security Agency is listening in on the international criminals and terrorists as they seek to buy chemicals and produce weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention will aid these efforts by making it harder for terrorists to get chemicals that could be turned against Americans. 
America has always led the effort to end the use of chemical weapons--and the convention will ensure that other countries follow our lead. We have already decided not to use chemical weapons and we have started to dismantle our chemical stockpile. 
Maryland is one of seven States that stores chemical weapons left over from the First and Second World Wars. For many years, we have lived with the threat of an accident. We are only now preparing to neutralize the chemical stockpile that is stored in Maryland. We in 
Maryland know first-hand the dangers these chemical weapons pose to military personnel and civilians. America's priority must be to safely dispose of these lethal chemicals--not to produce them. 
Mr. President, The Chemical Weapons Convention will make it harder for thugs and rogue nations to make and use chemical weapons. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its ratification.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this month, Joseph R.L. Sterne will be retiring as editorial page editor of the Baltimore Sun--a job he has held for more than 44 years. 
I have known Joe for more than 20 of those years. As editor, he has been one of the best. I cannot remember a time when his name was not at the top of the paper's masthead. I read his editorials and he has read my press releases. I think I liked his better. His editorials were him--they were fair, professional, insightful, instructive, tough and thorough. 
I've learned a lot from them. So did Baltimore and so did Maryland--whether it was an observation or suggestion regarding foreign policy or firm recommendation on how to improve Baltimore's housing policy or Federal tax issues. 
Joe started his career in 1953 covering the police beat. But he didn't stay there long. He quickly moved on to report on some of the most important moments in American history--from the civil rights movement to the Vietnam war to working in Africa and Germany covering international affairs. That was his true love. But he never forgot that a great hometown paper begins with a great hometown. 
His kudos and criticisms spurred all of us to do our best. But then, he asked no less of us than he asked of himself. He is one of the best. I will miss Joe Sterne. Baltimore will miss Joe Sterne. I wish him our best.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, once again I am deeply disturbed that Alexis Herman's confirmation to be Secretary of Labor has been held up. Miss Herman is being subjected to a level of scrutiny that is not deserving of her nor this institution. Miss Herman is being held hostage for political reasons. 
What is the real reason for the delay? Well, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say it is because of an Executive order that would encourage Federal agencies to consider the use of something called `project labor agreements' on any construction 
contract sent out for bid. How ironic that it is my colleagues that would hold up the nomination of the next Secretary of Labor because of an Executive order that asks contractors and subcontractors who bid on a Federal project to consider paying union wages, provide union-scale benefits, and use union hiring halls for labor--projects that are financed with taxpayers dollars. 
This order does not require the contractor to sign a collective bargaining agreement. It just makes sure that we help our workers maintain a decent wage and living standard. My Republican colleagues would hold up the nomination of the Secretary of Labor, whose responsibility it is to enforce our Nation's labor laws, because we want to ensure that contractors working on Federal projects abide by Federal laws. 
I want the nomination of Alexis Herman and the debate about her to focus on her qualifications and her competency to lead the Department of Labor. This should not be a debate on President Clinton's Executive order. I call upon the leadership of the other side of the aisle to let this nomination go forward, let there be debate on the Senate floor about Miss Herman's competency. Is she a coalition builder? Can she provide leadership? And does she provide a framework for the future? That is what the debate should be all about. 
My constituents are deeply concerned that Miss Herman, who brings so many credentials and competency, has been waiting month after month, subjected to character assassination, leaks in the press that distort her record, and now, just when she thought she was going to come to the Senate floor, not have that opportunity because some people are cranky about an Executive order issued by President Clinton. Be cranky with President Clinton. Do not be cranky with Alexis Herman or hold up her nomination. 
We cannot have this held up because of crankpots. I know Alexis Herman and I have known her for 20 years, when she worked in the Carter administration and I was a Congresswoman. Alexis Herman comes to us having graduated from a Catholic college in New Orleans, Xavier University. She was a social worker, working at Catholic Charities in foster care. Then she wanted to make sure she prevented family breakups, and she began working in job training and placement. In 1974, she headed up a black woman's employment program that then, because of its innovation and her management skill, went to nine other cities. 
Miss Herman brings to us a background where, at age 27, she was running a 10-city program to help minority women break into the work force. Is that not a Secretary of Labor we want to move people from welfare to work? At 29, she was the youngest person ever named to head the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor. Following that first Government service, she then went on to run her own business and help manage the 1992 Democratic convention. She is a coalition builder. Throughout her career, she has worked with parties on all sides to find good solutions. If you go back and talk with the people who have worked for her over the years, advocacy groups believe she will speak up for those who are left out and left behind. 
The community that provides the jobs, the business community, feels that she is a coalition builder and helps them solve issues from regulatory reform to how to do outreach in the minority communities. 
She will bring to the Labor Department a lifelong commitment to making sure that we create an opportunity ladder in this century. She has said publicly and to me privately that she wants to accept the challenge of moving people from welfare to work in a new era of time limit on welfare. She wants enhanced health and pension security for working people. She wants to ensure a safe and equal opportunity workplace, and she wants to work with the President in this on extending the lifelong education and training opportunities for our citizens. 
Mr. President, we need a Secretary of Labor. We need someone who is a leader, who is effective, and who has a vision for the 
future. I really encourage that the nomination of Alexis Herman be brought up after we finish our discussion on the chemical weapons treaty. 
I yield the floor.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a very special American, Mr. Fred Vanderveen, of Salisbury, MD. I am proud to say that Mr. Vanderveen is the 1997 winner of the National Heroes Award from the Sporting Goods Manufacturer's Association. This prestigious award is given each year to three individuals who make outstanding and unique humanitarian contributions to local sports programs throughout the Nation. 
Fred Vanderveen is a full-time high school biology teacher. But the classroom is only one area where Mr. Vanderveen is preparing our children for the future. He knows that developing the health and fitness of our children's bodies is as important as developing their minds. He also knows that kids need a safe place to go where they can have positive experiences, where they will be among friends, and where they will feel important. So he invested his life's savings in a sports and training facility called Youth Exercise Services. His facility is designed to meet the needs of mentally and physically handicapped athletes, at-risk youths, and anyone who will say no to drugs and yes to exercise. 
Mr. Vanderveen takes to his playing field at Youth Exercise Services the same way I take to the Senate floor: mission-driven, determined, and unwilling to lose. Through his dedication and hard work, the kids he touches learn that they don't have to lose either. Whether they are handicapped, at-risk, or just looking for a positive after school environment, they've got the chance to come out winners because Fred Vanderveen cares about each and every one of them. 
Mr. President, I want to give my warmest congratulations to Mr. Vanderveen, and to the kids whose lives he helps make better. His 1997 Heroes Award is richly deserved, and the State of Maryland is proud to call him one of our own.

Ms. MIKULSKI. 
Mr. President, I am honored to be joined by my colleagues, both men and women from both sides of the aisle, in introducing the reauthorization of the Mammography Quality Standards Act [MQSA]. The bill I am introducing today reauthorizes the original legislation which passed in 1992 with bipartisan support. 
What MQSA does is require that all facilities that provide mammograms meet key safety and quality-assurance standards in the area of personnel, equipment, and operating procedures. Before the law passed, tests were misread, women were misdiagnosed, and people died as a result of sloppy work. Since 1992, MQSA has been successful in bringing facilities into compliance with the Federal standards. 
What are these national, uniform quality standards for mammography? Well, facilities are required to use equipment designed specifically for mammography. Only radiological technologists can perform mammography. Only qualified doctors can interpret the results of mammography. Facilities must establish a quality assurance and control program to ensure reliability, clarity, and accurate interpretation of mammograms. Facilities must be inspected annually by qualified inspectors. Finally, facilities must be accredited by an accrediting body approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
This current reauthorization makes a few minor changes to the law to ensure the following: Patients and referring physicians must be advised of any mammography facility deficiency. Women are guaranteed the right to obtain an original of their mammogram. Finally, both State and local government agencies are permitted to have inspection authority. 
I like this law because it has saved lives. The frontline against breast cancer is mammography. We know that early detection saves lives. But a mammogram is worse than useless if it produces a poor-quality image or is misinterpreted. The first rule of all medical treatment is: Above all things, do no harm. And a bad mammogram can do real harm by leading a woman and her doctor to believe that nothing is wrong when something is. The result can be unnecessary suffering or even a death that could have been prevented. That is why this legislation is so important. This law must be reauthorized so that we don't go back to the old days when women's lives were in jeopardy. 
I want to make sure that women's health care needs are met comprehensively. It is expected that 180,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed and about 44,000 women will die from the disease in 1997. This makes breast cancer the most common cancer among women. And only lung cancer causes more deaths in women. 
We must aggressively pursue prevention in our war on breast cancer. I pledge to fight for new attitudes and find new ways to end the needless pain and death that too many American women face. This bill is an important step in that direction. On behalf of all the women of the Senate, I invite the men of the Senate who have not already cosponsored to do so. The women of America are counting on your support.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to state very clearly that I agree with the distinguished majority leader, the Republican leader, and the respected chairman of the Labor and Education Committee, Mr. Jeffords, in reauthorizing the Prescription Drug User Fee Act this year. And I also support strong bipartisan agreement on FDA reform. The time has come. The time is now. It is a window of opportunity to just do it. 
I am so pleased that we are proceeding on this, and not only in a bipartisan fashion, but a nonpartisan fashion. I had the pleasure of working with the former chairman, Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, who retired, on fashioning a bipartisan framework on FDA reform. 
I am so pleased that her successor, Senator Jeffords, has picked up the same framework as a working document for us to be able to proceed because this is what the American people want us to do--to work together to be able to have a Federal agency that oversees the approval of our pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and biomedical devices to ensure their safety and efficacy, but also to make sure they move out into clinical practice in a timely way. This is what we need to do because it will save lives and generate jobs in the United States of America. 
So I look forward to working with the distinguished chairman in fashioning the bill in committee and with the Republican leader in moving it to the Senate floor, because it is time to bring a smokestack regulatory framework into the computer age. FDA needs to adopt a new culture and move into the 21st century. That is why FDA reform is so important. We need a new regulatory framework that will make sure that we bring exciting new biomedical technology devices to not only millions of Americans in a timely fashion but this is a global field that will enable us to export around the world. 
Our country has been often known for exporting smart weapons of war but this will enable us to export smart new technology in the war against disease. This will be absolutely crucial. 
Reform is of great interest in my State of Maryland. Maryland is home to many biotechnology companies and medical device manufacturers and they are creating new scientific products which will save lives. 
In the 104th Congress, under the able leadership of now retired Senator Kassebaum, we reached that bipartisan consensus on effective and responsible FDA reform. Then I was pleased to join several of my Democratic colleagues in supporting the Kassebaum bill. And I am committed to achieving meaningful bipartisan reform this year. 
Coupled with FDA reform though, this is the year that we must reauthorize something called PDUFA. As has been outlined very ably by the chairman of the committee, this Prescription Drug User Fee Act has shown that it will significantly reduce drug approval time because it generated fees that have been used to hire more staff. It enabled the FDA to move more expeditiously in moving new drugs to patients more quickly. For example, new AIDS drugs are being approved now in a matter of months rather than a matter of years. 
FDA itself is located in my own State. They work under very difficult situations. They work out of modular buildings, many of 
which are spread over 27 different sites. They often are short-staffed. And they need to make sure we pass PDUFA so that they have the adequate resources they need to do the job while we help them fashion an adequate legislative and regulatory framework. 
We can build on this great track record. With the extension of PDUFA for another 5 years, we can have the opportunity to make further improvements. What can be done with some new drugs should be done for the benefit of many other patients. 
Mr. President, we are talking about the need to provide all the help we can to a Government agency that has an enormous impact on the day-to-day lives of Americans. The FDA is involved with everything from the drugs we take to the food we eat. Let us move on PDUFA and FDA reform in a sensible, responsible bipartisan manner. And as this is done, we must focus on the values of safety and efficacy while we will also streamline our process. 
I know also in the Chamber is the distinguished Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], who when we worked on the original PDUFA was in the House. He brings a great deal of knowledge to that. And we know he will be part of our bipartisan effort. So we thank you, I say to the Senator, and look forward to working with you. 
In conclusion, I would like to also thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Jeffords. He established a committee now called Public Health and Safety. It is the first time I believe in the committee's history that we have had a committee devoted strictly to focusing on the public health needs of the American people. The Centers for Disease Control and NIOSH and others will be so absolutely crucial. And being the gentleman that he is, he yielded that plum to another member of the committee, and enabled Dr. Bill Frist to chair that committee, who brings to the committee the experience as a physician of a hands-on clinical practice as well as the know-how and what it really takes to be able to save lives. 
This is what we need to be doing--the right committee structure, the right attitude within the committee so that we can all work together so that at the end of the term, we might not have solved every budget problem, we might not have balanced every line item, but at the end of this term people will be safer, their food, their pharmaceuticals, and so on, will be able to move quicker, faster, cheaper, maintaining safety and efficacy because of what this committee has done. I look forward to cooperating with that. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I introduce the HHS Women Scientist Employment Opportunity Act. What this bill does is quite simple. It will require all agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services to establish policies to ensure employment opportunities for women scientists within the Department. It will ensure a fair break for the many dedicated women scientists serving at the National Institutes of Health, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and other agencies or offices in the Department. Policies are to be reviewed regularly and revised if necessary. 
This bill is about the promoting equality. It is about supporting and advancing the careers of women scientists. It is about our Government leading the way in setting an example for both academia and industry on career policies for women scientists. 
In 1992, it came to my attention that women scientists at the National Institutes of Health were not being treated fairly. Women scientists at NIH indicated that they were not being given research and conference assignments that would help advance their careers. They were not being adequately recognized for their accomplishments. Publication opportunities were limited. Questions were raised about tenure and comparability of pay with male colleagues. 
Legislation was introduced in the 103d and 104th Congresses to address these concerns. I am encouraged that NIH voluntarily adopted some of the provisions outlined in these bills. But, this is only a start. We must continue to address the equity issues and policies impacting career advancement of our best and brightest women scientists. These issues deserve our utmost attention. That is why this bill is so important. It will ensure that the policies are in place to promote career opportunities for women scientists. And, it will ensure that policies are reviewed regularly, that progress is monitored and that policies are revised if necessary. 
What I like about this bill is that it addresses a problem in our own backyard. It says we in the Federal Government have a problem, and we are going to fix it. It ensures that our women scientists working at HHS are treated fairly. It serves as a model for the private sector by setting the stage for equity among our career scientists. It shows that we are very serious about equity and fair play in the scientific community. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting the HHS Women Scientist Employment Opportunity Act.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit. Mr. Garland is a resident of my State of Maryland. 
I am pleased that his nomination is finally on the Senate floor for a vote. It is critical that vacancies on the Federal bench are filled, especially at the appellate level. 
Mr. Garland has a distinguished legal record in the public and private sectors. He has specialized in criminal, civil, and appellate litigation, as well as administrative and antitrust law. I believe his experience will serve him well on the Federal bench once he is confirmed. 
Mr. Garland is a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School and a summa cum laude graduate of Harvard College. While at Harvard Law School, he was the articles editor of the Harvard Law Review and a member of the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa, while he attended Harvard College. 
When I decide whether to support a judicial nominee, I look at whether the nominee is competent; whether the nominee possesses the appropriate judicial temperament; whether the nominee possesses the highest personal and professional integrity, and whether the nominee will protect our core constitutional values. 
I believe that Mr. Garland possesses all of these qualifications. His legal and academic record are exemplary. I am impressed that he has devoted part of his career to public service. He served as the Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General in the Department of Justice. And he clerked after law school for one of the most distinguished Supreme Court Justices, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
He's also done extensive pro-bono legal work on behalf of disadvantaged individuals. He has represented an African-American employee in a claim of racial discrimination, a mother in a custody dispute, and court-requested representation of a prisoner. 
I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Garland's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit. I hope that once Mr. Garland is confirmed, we can move forward to a vote on the other pending Federal judicial nominees.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I am joining with my colleagues, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Warner, and Senator Akaka to submit a very important resolution. Our resolution states a simple fact--federal retirees should not be singled out for delays in their cost of living adjustments. 
As my colleagues know, 1997 was the first year since 1993 that Federal retirees received a timely COLA. Their COLA's were delayed until April for the last 3 years as part of the 1993 deficit reduction plan. They were willing to accept this delay because they knew that they would have to do their fair share to help us control the budget deficit. Many of them said to me, `Senator, I'm willing to tighten my belt another notch to help this country, as long as everyone else is asked to do the same.' 
Now we have a situation where retirees are being asked to tighten the belt again. Except this time they are being singled out for special treatment. We have proposals to delay Federal retiree COLA's for another 4 years. I don't think that's right --it's not fair and its not equitable. I think all COLA's--Federal, military, and Social Security should be paid on time. They should be reliable and they should be accurate. We owe our seniors, our Government retirees, and our military retirees nothing less. 
I am very disturbed by the recent trend of promises broken to Federal employees, and retirees. I believe that promises made should be promises kept. When Federal employees signed up for service, they agreed to defer some compensation until retirement. They knew that they would make less salary than in the private sector, but they also knew that they would have a stable benefits package of health insurance, life insurance, and retirement. If we delay their COLA's again we are telling them--sorry, we did not exactly tell you the truth when you signed up for service. We are telling them that they cannot rely on the benefits that they planned their retirements around. 
I do not think this is the way we should run our Government, and it's not the way we should treat our Government retirees. I am working to make sure we honor our commitments, and I urge all my colleagues to do the same and support this resolution.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, with sadness, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable Member of this body and a very dear friend, the senior Senator from Kentucky, Wendell Ford. Senator Ford has announced his retirement after a third of a century in public service, including the last 22 years in the U.S. Senate. When Wendell Ford leaves the Senate at the end of next year to return to his family and his beloved Kentucky, I will miss his leadership and his friendship tremendously. 
For the past 3 years, it has been my pleasure to serve with Senator Ford in the Democratic leadership in my capacity as conference secretary. Since 1990 Senator Ford has served in the leadership as Democratic whip, where he has been an energetic leader and has had a positive impact on the Senate's agenda. During the years I have served with him I have appreciated his good advice and his no-nonsense style. Senator Ford's insights into the issues and problems we address in the Senate, as well as his good word, have made him a valuable and trusted leader. Our leadership, the Senate, and most of all the State of Kentucky have greatly benefited from his service. 
Throughout his career in public service, Senator Ford has remained true to his constituents by being a strong advocate for his home State of Kentucky. He knows that a Senator's ultimate responsibility is to the people of his State. As a result of his advocacy and his honesty, Kentucky voters have returned him to Washington three times with landslide election victories. 
Senator Ford has also served as an advocate for the Senate. As chairman of the Rules Committee he has helped ensure the smooth operation of the Senate and has been a leader in looking for ways to make the Senate work more efficiently. As a member of the Committees on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, as well as Energy and Natural Resources, Senator Ford has been at the center of many of our most important national debates. 
I believe that I speak for all of my colleagues when I say that the departure of Senator Ford will leave a huge void in this institution. He has been an effective leader, a strong legislator, a fearless defender of his State, and a good friend. As he approaches retirement, I want to thank Wendell Ford for his service to his country and congratulate him for his extraordinary career. We will truly miss him.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing an important piece of legislation called the Federal Employee Compensation Protection Act. 
With the 1995 to 1996 Government shutdown fresh in our minds, I think it is crucial that we take steps in this Congress to keep faith with our Federal employees and make sure they are never again sent home without pay. My bill will keep that faith by protecting Federal employee pay and benefits during a future Government shutdown. This bill ensures that Federal employees in Maryland and across the Nation will be able to make their mortgage payments, put food on the table, and provide for their families during a shutdown. 
The last shutdown of the Federal Government severely disrupted the lives of thousands of Federal employees and their families. In my State of Maryland alone, there are more than 280,000 Federal employees. They are some of the most dedicated and hard-working people in America today. These employees have devoted their careers and lives to public service, and they should not have been used as pawns in a game of political brinkmanship. 
During the last several years, Federal employees have endured their fair share of hardship. Downsizing, diet COLA's, delayed COLA's, and attacks on pensions and health benefits have damaged morale at nearly every Federal agency. These assaults must stop. We cannot continue to denigrate and downgrade Federal employees and at the same time expect Government to work more efficiently. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and also work to prevent any future shutdowns of our Government. We have a contract with our Federal employees, and we should encourage their dedication by ensuring that the contract is honored and their pay and benefits are not put in jeopardy.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Hazardous Occupations Retirement Benefits Act of 1997. 
This legislation will grant an early retirement package for revenue officers of the Internal Revenue Service, customs inspectors of the U.S. Customs Service, and immigration inspectors of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
Under current law, with the exception of the groups listed in this legislation, all Federal law enforcement officers and firefighters are eligible to retire at age 50 with 20 years of Federal service. This legislation will amend the current law and finally grant the same 20-year retirement to these members of the Internal Revenue Service, Customs Service, and Immigration and Naturalization Service. The employees under this bill have very hazardous, physically taxing occupations, and it is in the public's interest to tenure a young and competent work force in these jobs. 
The need for a 20-year retirement benefit for inspectors of the Customs Service is easily apparent. These employees are the country's first line of defense against terrorism and the smuggling of illegal drugs at our borders. They have the authority to apprehend those engaged in such activities and carry a firearm on the job. They are responsible for the majority of arrests performed by Customs Service employees. In 1994, inspectors of the Customs Service seized 204,000 pounds of cocaine, 2,600 pounds of heroin, and 559,000 pounds of marijuana. They are required to undergo the same law enforcement training as all other law enforcement personnel. These employees face multiple challenges. They confront leading criminals in the drug war, organized crime figures, and increasingly sophisticated white-collar criminals. 
Revenue officers struggle with heavy workloads and a high rate of job stress, resulting in a variety of physical and mental symptoms. Many IRS employees must employ pseudonyms to hide their identity because of the great threat to their personal safety. The Internal Revenue Service has put out a manual for their employees entitled: `Assaults and Threats: A Guide to Your Personal Safety' to help employees respond to hostile situations. The document advises IRS employees how to handle on-the-job assaults, abuse, threatening telephone calls, and other menacing situations. 
Mr. President, this legislation is cost effective. Any cost that is created by this act is more than offset by savings in training costs and increased revenue collection. A 20-year retirement bill for these employees will reduce turnover, increase yield, decrease employee recruitment and development costs, and enhance the retention of a well-trained and experienced work force. 
I urge my colleagues to join me again in this Congress in expressing support for this bill and finally getting it enacted. This bill will improve the effectiveness of our inspector and revenue officer work force to ensure the integrity of our borders and proper collection of the taxes and duties owed to the Federal Government.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Let me be very clear, I want a balanced budget, and I am committed to do everything I can to achieve this goal. However, I do not believe we must amend the Constitution in order to balance the budget. 
I will oppose this amendment because it is unnecessary; because I am convinced that it threatens the viability of Social Security, and because it makes no provisions for investing in our infrastructure. 
This amendment does nothing to balance the budget. We already have the tools to do that. Since President Clinton's first term in the White House and my second term in the Senate, the deficit has fallen dramatically from $290 billion in 1992 to $107 billion in 1996. This amount represents just 1.4 percent of our gross domestic product, the smallest percentage of any industrialized nation. Clearly, as the past few years have shown us, we can continue to reduce the deficit--until it is balanced--without amending the Constitution. 
Many supporters of the balanced budget amendment believe that if you can balance the family budget, you can balance the Federal budget. But if each family lived by a balanced budget amendment, then mortgages, car loans, and student loans would be prohibited. In effect, a balanced budget amendment would prohibit the Federal Government from making the kind of investments for our future that our families make every day. 
Investments in our infrastructure would be threatened because the balanced budget amendment makes no provisions for a capital budget. 
Even State governments that require a balanced budget have a separate budget for capital projects, such as highways, schools, et cetera. The balanced budget amendment would restrict our ability to improve our infrastructure. 
To address this issue, Senator Feinstein and Senator Torricelli each offered an amendment to provide for a capital budget for infrastructure investments. I voted for both the Feinstein and Torricelli amendments. Unfortunately, both amendments were defeated. 
Recently, 11 Nobel prize-winning economists announced their opposition to the balanced budget amendment because they felt it would put the country in an economic straitjacket. They make a very compelling case. I have no doubt that the balanced budget amendment would tie the Federal Government in knots, restricting our ability to respond to emergencies and economic downturns. Even the Wall Street Journal referred to the balanced budget amendment as politically empty symbolism. I agree with them. 
Finally, I believe the balanced budget amendment threatens the Social Security system. Under the balanced budget amendment, there is no protection for Social Security benefits. If the Government finds that the budget is not balanced, the Social Security trust fund could be used to make up the difference. I voted for the Reid amendment which would have exempted the Social Security trust fund from the balanced budget amendment. I regret that this amendment was defeated. 
Mr. President, I will not allow the Social Security trust fund to be used to balance the budget. We have a contract with our senior citizens and I plan to honor that contract. A promise made must be a promise kept. Without protections for Social Security, I will have to vote against the balanced budget amendment. 
I fully support the goal of balancing the budget but a constitutional amendment is not the way to do it. We need to continue to reduce spending to reach a balanced budget in an orderly manner that recognizes national priorities such as Social Security and the importance of making investments in our future. 
Mr. President, I stand ready to continue working toward a balanced budget but tampering with the Constitution is not the way to do it.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I introduce the Older Americans Act amendments of 1997. The Older Americans Act expired in 1995 and we have not been able to reach consensus on reauthorizing it since then. I am introducing last year's administration bill. This bill may not be perfect. But, I want to get the debate started. The act is critical to meeting the day-to-day needs of America's seniors. This bill serves as a starting point for our deliberations. 
The Older Americans Act has been the major vehicle for organizing and delivering social services to the elderly since it was passed in 1965. It has supported a broad array of service programs through a network of 57 State agencies and 670 local area agencies on aging. As a result of this act, our seniors have benefited from millions of contacts and referrals for services. They have benefited from millions of rides and meals provided through the transportation and nutrition programs. They have benefited from the elder abuse program. And, they have benefited from the jobs program. These examples show how coordinated service programs help keep our seniors in their own homes and communities as viable members of society. 
The bill I put forth today focuses on increasing flexibility to States, area agencies on aging, and providers. This flexibility will allow them to be innovative in designing and implementing programs and services for the elderly. It takes into account the distinct interest of all partners. It strives to balance those interest between all partners. It focuses on streamlining and enhancing effectiveness of programs for our seniors. It sets the stage for performance partnerships and innovative ways of providing services. It ensures that performance measures mandated under the Government Performance and Results Act [GPRA] are in place so that we can see the results of these programs. It retains the programs for native Americans. 
These are some of the things this bill will do. But, it is time for us to take action. It is time for us to address the issues at hand. It is time for us to pass a bill ensuring that the needed services and programs are available to our seniors.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support the release of funds for international family planning. This program is essential to enabling the world's poorest women to improve their lives--and the lives of their families. 
Over the past 2 years, Congress has drastically cut funds for international family planning--and has put barriers in the way of implementing the program. We have tied our international family planning program in knots--and are denying health care to the world's poorest women. 
Today we will vote to right part of this wrong. We are not voting to increase international family planning. We are simply voting to release the funds--so that our family planning program will no longer be held hostage. 
What do the cuts and delays in funding mean for poor women? The Alan Guttmacher Institute estimates that it means that 7 million couples in developing countries will no longer have access to contraceptives. There could be almost 2 million unplanned births. And there could be up to 1.6 million additional abortions. 
When we deny a woman the right to choose whether or not to have children, we deny her the right to control and improve her life. We deny her the right to help herself and her family. 
Those who oppose international family planning assistance claim to want to reduce the number of abortions. But the effect of our policies is just the opposite. Family planning prevents unwanted pregnancies and abortions. You would think this basic fact would not need to be restated on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
America's international family planning funds are not spent on abortion. So now, some insist on going after basic health care services that prevent pregnancy. 
Over 100 million women throughout the world cannot obtain family planning because they are poor, uneducated, or lack access to health care. Twenty million of these women will seek unsafe abortions. Some women will die, some will be disabled. We could prevent some of this needless suffering. 
This issue won't go away. I will join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in fighting against the irrational and cruel effort to end U.S. assistance for international family planning. We will continue the fight to enable the world's poorest women to control and improve their lives.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a friend and colleague; one who has both orbited the Earth and walked the Halls of Congress. Performing either responsibility on its own has been the dream of many. Achieving both has been realized by very few. Senator John Glenn is a truly remarkable man. 
So it was with sadness that I received the news of his plans to retire at the end of this Congress. His early announcement will give us some time to try to get used to the idea of a Senate without his calm leadership, his uncommon commitment and dedication, and his tremendous decency and civility. 
Senator Glenn has helped make our Space Agency, NASA, what it is today. Senator Glenn's Mercury space mission 34 years ago sparked a national interest in space exploration that continues to this day. John Glenn is a national hero who is the personification of astronaut. Since his daring and heroic mission, children all over the country have dreamt of becoming astronauts. 
The environment of Washington is as foreign to many as the Moon. Senator Glenn left the Moon in orbit, while trying to bring Washington more down to Earth--closer and more responsive to the needs of the American people. John Glenn has played a vital role in helping to pass several measures important to reinventing our Government. 
Senator Glenn and I share a strong respect for the environment. I was a proud cosponsor of Senator Glenn's Department of the Environment Act, which would have elevated the Environmental Protection Agency to Cabinet-level status. In introducing this important bill, Senator Glenn noted that, having had the rare privilege to view the Earth in all of its beauty and grandeur from space, he was struck by how thin and fragile the environment is that sustains life on our planet. I absolutely agree with him and appreciate what he has done for the environment. Our environment has had a strong ally in the Senate, and we will miss his leadership on these issues. 
When this Congress is over, and Senator Glenn touches down in his home State of Ohio, we will remember him as a friend and hero whose achievements have displayed a strong respect for the Earth and its inhabitants.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Graham in introducing the Access to Emergency Medical Services Act of 1997. This bill prohibits health plans from denying coverage and payment for emergency room visits. I support this bill for three reasons. It protects patients and patients' pocketbooks. It respects medical decisions made by doctors and nurses. It gives HMO's the opportunity to do the right thing. 
Personal health is not something to take chances with. That's why many people seek emergency assistance when they think something may be seriously wrong with their health. They go to the emergency room thinking their insurance company covers emergency room treatment. But when the problem turns out to be a nonemergency, the insurance company denies payment. This is called retrospective denial. I want to end retrospective denials. No family should have to second guess getting the care they need because they are worried about being stuck with an enormous bill. 
Last week my office received a phone call from a woman in Frederick, MD. She was distraught. She had begged her husband not to take her to the emergency room when she complained of serious chest pains. She knew their insurance company wouldn't pay. It had happened before. But her husband insisted she go. He was worried about her and wanted her to see a doctor. She cried all the way to the hospital. A few weeks later she got the notice--her claim was denied. She was stuck with the bill. 
She was right to go to the emergency room. There are approximately 200 medical problems that could cause the type of chest pain she experienced ranging from a heart attack to pulmonary emboli to simple indigestion. The point is, no one knows for sure what problem they are having until they get treatment from an emergency room physician. 
Maryland already has laws in place to guarantee that HMO's will cover to emergency services. But we can't practice good emergency medicine one patient, one ER room, or one State at a time. That's why we need a national law that ensures that medical decisions are made in the ER room, not the corporate boardbroom. 
This bill will set a new national definition for the term `emergency' without preempting stronger State laws. The `Prudent Layperson Standard' means that a person with average knowledge of health and medicine can seek emergency treatment when they think they have a serious medical condition. Quite often, patients do not know when they go to an emergency room whether their illness is life-threatening or not. With this standard, they are not required to know--they can use their own best judgment. After all, we can't expect the average person to be able to diagnose like a doctor. 
I am proud that the State of Maryland was the first State to enact legislation to counter these unfair practices. They passed their first law in 1993. But it took two follow-up laws to clarify the intent of the first one. Work still needs to be done to make sure the law is enforced. I salute the Maryland emergency physicians who took this issue on, and continue to fight for fair play on behalf of their patients. 
I want to see managed care, but I don't want to see doctors managed. There is a fundamental distinction. We have to start getting our priorities straight and decide where we are going to be making our decisions. And in the case of emergencies--I believe the decisions need to be made in the emergency room and not the boardroom.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support for the confirmation of Rodney Slater as the new Secretary for the Department of Transportation. 
Mr. Slater has the experience, the sense of purpose, and the commitment to make sure that our transportation infrastructure is ready for the new century. He is well suited to head the Department of Transportation, a large and complex agency which is so vital to America's infrastructure. Transportation is one of the underpinnings of our economy, and plays an essential role in the daily lives of all Americans. A safe and efficient system of transportation is needed to keep our growing economy strong. 
Rodney Slater understands that transportation is an engine for job creation. He knows that it provides hundreds of good paying jobs in the development of transportation technologies, in construction, and in the delivery of transportation services. From the person who drives the light rail train through my own hometown of Baltimore, to the scientists and engineers designing the transportation networks of the future, transportation means jobs. Mr. Slater understands that. 
Under Mr. Slater's guidance, the Department of Transportation will continue to encourage new technologies, promote safety, and protect our environment. He is the right person to manage our national infrastructure, and lead the way to better and safer roads and transit systems, airports, and to keep us globally competitive. 
Mr. President, I look forward to working with Mr. Slater on making the Department of Transportation a more effective and efficient agency. We must work together to meet the transportation needs and challenges that we face as we enter the 21st century. Much has been done and continues to be done as we work as partners to revitalize America's transportation system. 
Mr. Slater is equipped for this task. He was appointed to the Arkansas State Highway Commission in 1987, and made its chairman in 1992. Mr. Slater understands the needs of local and State governments. He understands the need for our rural, suburban, and urban areas to be connected, and provide the access to opportunity. 
As the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, Mr. Slater has shown his commitment to put people first, and to rebuild America. He has listened to thousands of constituents and incorporated their concerns into the Federal Highway Administration's decisionmaking process. He has led this agency as it rebuilt and expanded our Nation's highways, and in the process created jobs and opportunities. 
I look forward to working with Mr. Slater as he works to meet the transportation needs of Maryland and those across this great Nation. I urge my colleagues to confirm the nomination of Mr. Rodney Slater as Secretary of the Department of Transportation.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing this resolution in support of NATO enlargement. 
I support NATO enlargement because it will make Europe more stable and secure. It means that the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe will share the burden of European security. It will mean that future generations of Americans might not have to fight and die for Europe. 
America has fought and won three wars in Europe: 
World War I, when an assassination in Yugoslavia led to years of bloodshed 
World War II, the bloodiest war in history--when thousands of young Americans left factories and farms to fight on the battlefields of Europe 
And the cold war--when Soviet expansionism forced us to prepare to defend Western Europe--and when the captive nations of Eastern Europe were forced behind the Iron Curtain. 
If NATO doesn't enlarge--the Iron Curtain returns--and the unnatural division of Europe into two parts will live on longer than the Soviet Empire did. 
As a Polish American, I know that the Polish people did not choose to live behind the Iron Curtain. They were forced there by the Yalta Agreement, by Potsdam, and because they and the Baltic States and the other captive nations were sold out by the free world. 
But my support for this resolution is based on the future--not the past. I support this resolution because NATO enlargement will mean a future in which the newly free and democratic countries will take their rightful place as members of Europe. 
NATO played an important in part in securing this freedom. It has been the most successful defensive alliance in history. It is an alliance that helped us win the cold war. It deterred war between the super powers, and it helped prevent confrontations between member states. 
But if NATO is to survive, it must adapt to meet the needs of the post-cold-war-World--or it will become irrelevant. 
NATO has evolved since we created it in 1949. We have enlarged NATO on three different occasions. Each new member strengthened NATO and increased security in Europe. 
Today, we are facing very different threats to security and stability in Europe. We have hot spots caused by ethnic and regional tensions. We have civil wars--as in Bosnia. And we have international crime, drugs, and terrorism. NATO must change and expand to meet these new threats. 
The countries of Central and Eastern Europe want to help us address these new threats. How many times has the Senate discussed burden sharing in Europe? How often have we complained that European countries were not willing to pay their fair share for their own defense? 
Now we have countries that are asking to share the burden. They are asking to pledge their troops and equipment for the common defense. They are asking to share the burden of peacekeeping--in fact they are doing it right now in Bosnia where thousands of troops from Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Baltics, Ukraine, and others are helping to secure the peace. 
These countries are not asking for a handout. They are not asking for our protection. They are asking to be full partners in the new Europe. By transforming their countries into free market democracies, they have earned this right. 
Mr. President, NATO is moving toward enlargement. In July President Clinton will join the leaders of our NATO partners in naming the first countries to be asked to join NATO. 
This resolution states that the U.S. Senate stands with our President as he leads our effort to prepare NATO for the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this resolution.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Ambassador Pamela Harriman. She was a gallant and courageous lady--and a very dear friend. 
Pamela Harriman lived a full and exciting life. We all know of her grace and her charm. But she was so much more. 
She was, for me, first of all a good friend. She and I worked together on issues and politics for many years. She was a tremendous supporter of women candidates, and I often turned to her for her insight and counsel. I will always treasure the memory of my last visit with Ambassador Harriman. She helped me to work with European space agencies--to foster better links with our space program. She was, as always, perceptive and enthusiastic about the prospect of greater cooperation between America and Europe. 
She wanted to make a contribution to our political system. She brought together leaders from all sectors of society to discuss a wide range of important issues. She fostered the kind of civil political discourse that is so often lacking. 
Ambassador Harriman had the kind of strong patriotism that comes from being born in another country--and from witnessing first hand what America did during the Second World War. She often talked about living through the Battle of Britain--and how America's military partnership helped the British people to keep their morale high. She loved her adopted country--and she served it with great honor. 
She was one of our Nation's most effective ambassadors. During a period of prickly relations with France, she was able to reassure the French of the importance of our friendship and alliance. 
The French liked and trusted her. She knew the language, the people, and the country. She respected their history and their culture. The French honored her with their highest cultural honor--the commander of the Order of Arts and Letters. 
Mr. President, Ambassador Harriman's sudden death was a tragedy. But her life was a triumph. Her family is in my prayers. I will miss her deeply.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution and am pleased to be a cosponsor of the resolution with my distinguished colleague, Senator Snowe of Maine. Senator Snowe has been an outstanding advocate for many years on the issue of women's health. This is yet one more action on her part that shows her deep commitment in this area. 
Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I am pleased to tell you that my colleagues in the Democratic caucus join with us on a bipartisan basis and have endorsed this. All six Democratic women have cosponsored this legislation. Over 30 of the men that we call the `Galahads' also cosponsored this resolution. 
What does this resolution call for? It calls for three things that would protect women's health, particularly in the area of breast cancer. No. 1, it calls for further research on the benefits of mammograms for women in their forties; No. 2, it urges the public to follow screening guidelines issued by medical groups which call for mammography screenings in women between the ages of 40 and 49; and it calls upon the National Cancer Institute to again revisit the guidelines that they themselves promulgated, also urging that women who are between the ages of 40 and 49 seek mammograms. 
We already have clearly on the record, and clear guidelines have established, that women over 50 should get an annual mammogram. It is clear that often the older you get, the more likely you are to get breast cancer. But there is a particular group of women between ages 40 and 49 who are particularly prone to breast cancer, and each day we are learning more who that category is. Therefore, we are urging through this sense-of-the-Senate resolution that traditional guidelines urging annual or, at the very least, biannual mammograms for women between the ages of 40 and 49 be pursued. 
I could not believe when an NIH advisory panel decided that women in this age group might not need mammograms, and at the very best, they were either silent or tepid in their recommendations. They made this decision because they felt there was not substantial evidence that this group was at risk. This flies in the face of what we know through studies done at the National Institutes of Health, through extramural programs at our great academic centers of excellence, and also in worldwide studies of women. The NIH panel should have recognized, also, the weight that their announcement carries. This panel absolutely confused the public, scared women, and gave permission to insurance companies not to pay for a mammogram for a woman between the ages of 40 and 49. 
Mr. President, we think this creates a public health concern. Now, why would we believe that? First, women often have been reluctant to seek a mammogram either out of fear or because they do not have the Federal resources to do it. We have been working on education to deal exactly with those issues and even to offer opportunities for women to be able to have funding for this. Also, we have been engaged in an impressive and assertive effort to educate primary care physicians in urging women to get mammograms. 
We have been dealing with the insurance companies on the whole issue of breast cancer. Now some companies have that misguided approach of insisting that women leave a hospital in less than 48 hours after they have had a mastectomy. Mr. President, we say enough is enough. We should take time out, go back to our science, go back to our research, go back to the National Institutes of Health and ask them to come up with the recommendations that we need. We are urging them to do that. Not only are we urging them to do that, but the actual Director of the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Richard Klausner, is also recommending that this advisory board go back and take another look. 
Senator Snowe has talked about the risk of cancer. We all know that any woman can fall prey to breast cancer. It does not matter how old she is or what her income bracket is. We know she needs to be screened. We know 40,000 women die every year of breast cancer. We know over 138,000 women every year have some early signs of breast cancer. What we are saying on behalf of the 
women and the men who support us, let us go back to our standards. 
I am happy to have joined in this resolution because I know that mammograms save lives. And if breast cancer is detected early, the probability that a woman will survive is greater than 90 percent. My position is simple: Stick to science, go to the guidelines that were properly promulgated, listen to doctors and other health care providers working in this field. 
Mr. President, for some time we have been working in a bipartisan bicameral basis on this. I remember back in the House of Representatives when Senator Snowe and I introduced one of the first Women's Health Equity Act's that we called for activity in this area. We have been working on that ever since, on a bipartisan bicameral basis, and not only with the women taking the lead, but with the enthusiastic support of the men in our body. 
Thanks to the work of Senators Snowe, Mikulski, and Boxer, and Representative Morella and others, we have established the Office of Women's Health at NIH. We made more money for research available for diseases most affecting women. We ensured that women were included in the protocols of medical research, where they had been excluded not because of science but because of gender. We worked to expand the coverage for mammograms under Medicare and even provided funds for low-income women to get mammograms. We also have led the fight for mammogram quality standards, which we will be reintroducing as it expires. We hope to do this together, to show that when it comes to fighting for women's health, we are there. We want to make sure that each family is able to ensure that breast cancer does not strike them. We are going to do it not only on a bipartisan basis, we are going to do it on a nonpartisan basis. 
I thank Senator Snowe for taking the lead on this as she has done in so many other areas. We are pleased on our side of the aisle to also join with her. 
I send to the desk the list of the Democratic cosponsors. I look forward to voting for this bill and continuing our advocacy on this most crucial issue.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to conclude the debate on this side by reaffirming that this resolution does not meddle with the National Institutes of Health. It does not meddle with science. It essentially says let us have more research on the subject of breast cancer in terms of its cause, in terms of its prevention, and in terms of its cures. 
It also calls for the women of America and their physicians to follow those guidelines that are recommended by every physician group as well as the American Cancer Society on urging women in the age 40 to 49 group to have either an annual or biannual mammogram. 
Third, it asks the National Cancer Institute to repromulgate its own guidelines urging the same. 
I would like to comment that this advisory panel that made this report in January is not made up of NIH scientists. This is an outside advisory group to the National Institutes of Health. 
Mr. President, I have the honor of representing the National Institutes of Health because it is in my State. How wonderful to be able to represent a Government organization devoted to saving lives by finding cures and causes for the diseases that threaten Americans and others around the world. 
The National Cancer Institute has taken specific steps to be far more sensitive and to have a budget priority looking at those gender-specific diseases, particularly breast cancer and ovarian cancer. And we are pleased also with the work that is now being done in the area of prostate cancer as well. 
I believe that the National Cancer Institute is on the right track. We want to be sure that they continue their scientific research, and if there is a gray area about when you should have a mammogram always go to the side of safety. Always go to the side of caution. One of the things we know is that when you are treated by a physician more information is often better information. 
So, Mr. President, I urge unanimous adoption of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
Knowing no other Democrats who wish to comment on this issue, I yield the remainder of my time and look forward to the vote at 5 p.m. 
Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, in sponsoring this important legislation. This bill would authorize the appointment of additional bankruptcy judges for the state of Maryland. 
Bankruptcy filings nationwide have dramatically increased. In my State of Maryland, over 20,000 individuals and businesses filed bankruptcy last year. Unfortunately, bankruptcy filings have hit a peak nationwide with both individuals and businesses seeking relief from financial debt. While the economic climate in Maryland is much better than in many parts of the country, the recent recession has had an impact on consumers in my State. 
This bill will give relief to bankruptcy judges, who hear cases in Maryland. These judges have had a growing caseload to process. This is good news for consumers, who are seeking a reorganization of their debts and creditors seeking to protect their rights. It is critical that consumers are able to have their bankruptcy petitions processed in a timely manner. For the debtor seeking to protect his home under a chapter 13 filing, this bill will help expedite the process and allow the bankruptcy judge to give full consideration to the petition. 
Maryland's bankruptcy judges have had to struggle to keep up with the growing docket. Because of the current heavy caseload, judges cannot schedule hearings in a timely manner. This adversely affects the debtor's reorganization and delays distributions to creditors. 
The District of Maryland currently has four bankruptcy judges. The Judicial Conference recommended the authorization of an additional judge. Their findings were based on the weighted caseload per judge, which is a good indicator of a judge's workload. 
Maryland's judges are working strenuously in the best interests of both debtors and creditors. But, their caseload requires additional assistance. Maryland needs at a minimum one more bankruptcy judge, but would prefer two more judges. 
Judges from other districts have helped Maryland's bankruptcy judges. However, these judges have had to struggle with their own increasing caseloads. 
The Judicial Conference found that Maryland's judges have a caseload per judge that is 70 percent above the national average. Clearly, the bankruptcy judges in Maryland's district are overwhelmed by the caseload. Even with the addition of another bankruptcy judge, Maryland's judges would still have a caseload that is above the national average. So, I hope we will be able to provide two additional slots. 
I hope my colleagues will support this legislation. It is important for consumers and creditors to process their claims. It is also important to provide equity in handling the caseload in Maryland's bankruptcy courts.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination of Alan Hantman to be the next Architect of the Capitol. 
Mr. Hantman's nomination is the culmination of a long and thorough search process conducted by the bipartisan Architect of the Capitol Search Commission. 
He has a distinguished record, having served as vice president for architecture, planning, and construction at the Rockefeller Center. I believe he is in an excellent position to lead the Architect of the Capitol into the 21st century.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I offer today my strong support for the confirmation of Andrew Cuomo as the new Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. 
I want my colleagues to know that Mr. Cuomo is a proven leader in the housing and community development field. For the past 4 years, he has served as the assistant secretary for HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development. While managing a $10 billion portfolio that has doubled over the last 4 years, he helped reduce administrative overhead by 20 percent--helping us to get more bang for the taxpayers buck. Mr. Cuomo's efforts in merging 12 bureaucratic processes into one streamlined system known as consolidated planning won him the Innovations in American Government award for 1996 from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. His goal of streamlining, decentralizing, and consolidating programs is one that I have advocated for years as chairman and ranking member of the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. Many of Mr. Cuomo's initiatives were based on the recommendations made by the National Academy of Public Administration in a report that I commissioned as chairman of the subcommittee. 
Mr. Cuomo has also overseen the implementation of the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Initiative, which has combined local community planning with Federal dollars to help produce new jobs and housing in 72 cities. He also created a new economic development initiative which worked in conjunction with a loan guarantee program to provide $1.85 billion in much needed low-interest loans for cities in 1995, up from $229 million in 1993. Mr. Cuomo's work on implementing the continuum of care strategy to help the homeless has led to 14 times as many homeless people being served with only twice the funding. In addition, his emphasis on coordination of services and resources has generated 30 times more private and nonprofit dollars since 1992. His focus on real results instead of simplistic statistical compilations of program activity is one which I share and strongly commend. 
Mr. Cuomo's service in the field dates back to his founding in 1986 of HELP--Housing Enterprises for the Less Privileged, which grew to become the Nation's largest provider of transitional housing for the homeless. Mr. Cuomo also founded the Genesis project--which develops comprehensive approaches to linking community development with affordable housing. His experiences on the front lines of the battle against urban poverty and despair help him to make practical decisions that work in the real world. 
Mr. President, I look forward to working with Mr. Cuomo on making the Department of Housing and Urban Development a more effective and efficient agency. There are major issues that the Department and the Congress must address this year. We must continue to work to find solutions to the problem of the over-subsidized Section 8 assisted housing inventory. I will continue to insist that we don't create an additional burden for the taxpayers, and that we find a solution that does not lead to community destabilization. 
Mr. President, we must also work with Mr. Cuomo to ensure that HUD maintains proper oversight and standards for local public housing authorities. HUD must stand sentry and ensure that local public housing authorities are providing real opportunities--not hollow opportunities--and ensuring adequate housing for the poor citizens of our Nation. I want to work with Mr. Cuomo on ending what I call the zip codes of pathology that have resulted from the programs of the past. We have repealed--in our annual appropriations bills--the Federal preferences that concentrated the poorest of the poor in one area. I will work with Mr. Cuomo and my colleagues on the Banking Committee to make these repeals permanent, in addition to the repeal of such Federal requirements as one-for-one replacement, take-one-take-all, and endless leases.  
Mr. President, there is much work to be done at HUD. We must continue to streamline the agency, demolish the worst public housing, and deliver programs that focus on personal and community empowerment. I was pleased to see in Mr. Cuomo's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on January 22, 1997, he noted that `the object of our efforts must be the development of self-sufficiency, not the perpetuation of government programs.' Indeed, the days of a bloated bureaucracy with a focus only on bricks and mortar are gone. We must combine local sweat equity and public-private partnerships with Federal dollars to help rebuild the social fabric of our deteriorating communities. I look forward to working with Mr. Cuomo to make HUD a model agency that makes a real difference in the lives of the people it serves. I will support his efforts to make HUD smarter, smaller and better. I am certain he is up to the task.

 Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, each year an elite group of young women rise above the ranks of their peers and confront the challenge of attaining the Girl Scouts of the United States of America's highest rank in scouting, the Girl Scout Gold Award. 
It is with great pleasure that I recognize and applaud a young woman from the State of Maryland who is an honored recipient of this most prestigious and time honored award. She is Eileen Butler of Ijamsville, MD, and Girl Scout Troop 1034. She has been honored with the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. Gold Award by Penn Laurel Girl Scout Council in York, PA. 
The young women given this highest achievement in Girl Scouting are to be commended on their extraordinary commitment and dedication to their families, their friends, their communities, and to the Girl Scouts of the United States of America. 
The qualities of character, perseverance, and leadership which enabled them to reach this goal will also help them to meet the challenges of the future. They are our inspiration for today and our promise for tomorrow. 
I am honored to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Eileen Butler. For her Girl Scout Gold Award project, Eileen designed and set up three new exhibits for the Fountain Rock Park, a nature center. Her project addressed the need for a better understanding of the environment and the importance of working to improve the environment around you. She is one of the best and the brightest and serves as an example of character and moral strength for us all to imitate and follow.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I enthusiastically support the nomination of our colleague Senator Bill Cohen to be Secretary of Defense. 
I salute President Clinton for reaching out beyond party lines. I salute Bill Cohen for being ready to join the Democratic Administration. They both know that when it comes to the national defense of our country--we have no party interest--just national interest. 
Senator Cohen has shown that he cares deeply about the national interest--and that means a lot more to him than party politics. He has proven this time and time again, not just on national security issues but when he worked on behalf of senior citizens, when he sought to reach a consensus on health care reform, when he supported affirmative action and when he fought for lobbying reform. His is a voice of independence, integrity, and moderation. 
As a member of the Armed Services Committee, he was one of the Senate's most articulate voices for a strong and efficient national defense. He cares deeply about the men and women of our Armed Forces. He has long fought to make sure that while we downsize our military--we do not downgrade our military. 
Mr. President, I believe Senator Cohen is the ideal person to lead our Armed Forces into the new century. I am proud to support his nomination, and I look forward to working with him to ensure that we maintain the best equipped, best trained, and most ethical military in the world.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. This bill is about ensuring that women receive equitable treatment in our Nation's health care system. It puts the care of grandmothers, mothers, and daughters with breast cancer before the financial interests of insurance companies. 
One of every eight women in America will develop breast cancer. These women will undergo breast cancer treatments such as mastectomies or lymph node removal. Insurance companies know they can cut costs and increase profits if they give skimpy care to these women. Some insurance plans send women home just hours after breast cancer surgery with patients groggy from anesthesia, in pain and with drainage tubes still in place. Other plans require outpatient mastectomies. 
The American College of Surgeons and the American Medical Association say that most patients are not ready to be sent home a few hours after surgery. It is just not good medicine. I believe these doctors, who want to do the right thing and give the right care, should not be discouraged or penalized for not following the insurance company's guidelines. 
This legislation ensures that women with breast cancer receive the medical attention they need and deserve. The bill ensures that health plans which provide medical and surgical benefits for the treatment of breast cancer provide a minimum length of stay of 48 hours for patients undergoing mastectomies and 24 hours for those undergoing lymph node removals. Under this bill, patients and their physicians--not insurance companies--can determine if a shorter period of hospital stay is appropriate. 
So, I salute the authors of this bill, but I also salute the women, the doctors, and the medical facilities that organized to challenge these unfair practices. I want to see managed care, not mandated care. And I don't want to see doctors managed. There is a fundamental distinction. We have to start getting our priorities straight and end the needless pain and neglect of women with breast cancer. This bill is a step in the right direction.

Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair. 
Today, indeed, is a historic day. We gather on the Senate floor to be presented both to ourselves and the American people the nomination of Dr. Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State--Madeleine Albright, the very first woman to be nominated Secretary of State; Madeleine Albright, the very first refugee to be nominated Secretary of State. 
What a wonderful, historic opportunity we have to confirm her nomination and to make history as well as to help carry out President Bill Clinton's foreign policy, to make the world a better and safer place. 
I know Dr. Albright well. We have been friends and colleagues for many years, and I am so enthusiastic about her nomination because of her skills, her experience, her character, her values. She is a woman of honor, integrity and extraordinary patriotism. 
As President Clinton was making his decision, I called him. I called him to urge that he consider Dr. Albright. I said there are three important reasons why I felt Madeleine Albright is the best person to serve as Secretary of State in this new millennium. First, she is a woman of great competence in the area of foreign policy and demonstrated skills in that area as our Ambassador to the United Nations. 
Second, her remarkable personal history is the story of America. 
And third, she has a great and unusual ability to communicate our foreign policy to the American people and to the world. 
First, she would bring great competency and experience to the post. Foreign policy is her life's work and her life's passion. In addition to her dazzling intellectual ability and scholarship, Ambassador Albright has diplomatic skills and the understanding of what this new world order is all about. 
She has a proven record. As our Ambassador to the United Nations, she showed brains and backbone asserting U.S. policy. We do not need to question whether she can deal with China, different cultures or with dictators. She has already done it. She is respected by our allies and by our foes. She has proven that she is firm, fair, and tenacious. 
For the past 4 years, she has defended our values and interests at the United Nations, and she has done more to bring fiscal responsibility to the United Nations. She stood up to dictators and stood by our friends. 
As Secretary of State, Ambassador Albright will do something else. She will bring a story of America to people from the old world order as well as the new and emerging one. I discussed with President Clinton her personal story, that she is the daughter of the last Ambassador from a free Czechoslovakia until the end of the cold war. While her father was in this country, Czechoslovakia fell to a dictatorship. He defected so that he could serve Czechoslovakia by being a good American and by being a spokesman in this area. She comes from a history and tradition where patriots are willing to make sacrifices. 
She knows what it means to lose a home to dictatorship and therefore she reaches out to others who experience the same pain. She will understand those who labor tirelessly in exile to reclaim their freedom, and will support them. 
And, as new immigrants, Madeleine Albright and her family used America's great opportunity structure so they could rebuild their lives, based on opportunity, merit, and hard work. Where else in the world could a refugee rise to become the highest ranking woman in our history? 
She has also been involved in the social movements of our time, whether the civil rights movement or the women's movement, or those social movements that help create a democracy. The world is not just transformed by treaty and law, but cultural and social transformations often occur through democratic social movements, institutionalized in a positive way. And Albright will do that. 
As a child whose family fled from Europe as the Iron Curtain was raised and slammed down on the people of Central Europe, she stood up. She knows what this is all about. As a member of an immigrant family making a start in a new country, she will work to ensure that our foreign aid is used to foster opportunity around the world. 
Mr. President, the third reason Ambassador Albright will be an extraordinary Secretary of State is she has an unusual talent for communication. She has already demonstrated her capacity to articulate the President's policy and agenda, not only to the world, but also to the American people. She will enable people to understand our American policies. This is essential to mobilize support for these policies, both at home and abroad. Even if our policies are not supported, they should be understood and respected. No one does a better job of explaining American foreign policy to the American people than Madeleine Albright. Most people are understandably concerned about their jobs, their children, their security. It is a lot to ask them to focus on Bosnia, Haiti, Chechnya, human rights, China. And after paying billions of dollars to win the cold war, many Americans wonder why we must continue that burden of leadership. 
We cannot solve every problem in the world and we should not try. But we must act where we can make a difference, where American values and interests are at stake. With Dr. Madeleine Albright as Secretary of State, we will continue to have a foreign policy that reflects our values, that serves our interests, in consultation with Congress, and with mobilized American support. 
Mr. President, let me conclude by saying this. There is an added bonus to Dr. Madeleine Albright's nomination. The Senate is about to confirm this highest ranking woman in American history. As the first woman elected by my own party to serve in her own right, and as the senior woman in the Senate, I must say this is truly a historic occasion. This is a moment for all of us to take pride in, in the opportunity and fairness of our country. 
Mr. President, the American people will not have to worry about Madeleine Albright's service. When she was nominated, she said this to her daughters, `When you were little girls I often used to worry where you were and what you are doing. Now you will wonder where your mother is and what she is doing.' 
But, you know, the American people will not have to worry. Whether it is in Cyprus, Singapore, China, she will be defending American values and interests. She will be one of the best Secretaries of State we have ever had. 
Mr. President, that concludes my remarks. I would like to extend my appreciation to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for the way he conducted the hearing and the nomination process, with the fairness and civility and the expeditious way he does it. 
I, and I know Dr. Albright and her entire family who support her, appreciate the courtesy and expeditious nature in which the distinguished Senator from North Carolina has dealt with this. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am honored to join the Senate Minority Leader in cosponsoring the Children's Health Coverage Act of 1997. This bill will help uninsured working families purchase health insurance for their children and will build on the success of last year's Kassebaum-Kennedy health care reform legislation. It makes the health of all America's children a national priority. It takes the Democratic health care agenda one more step. 
Our country has failed to meet the health care needs of America's children. The United States has the highest rate of uninsured children of any industrialized country. In my home State of Maryland, nearly 1 in 5 children is uninsured. That's almost 200,000 kids in Maryland alone. This is a disgrace for a country as bountiful as ours is. We say children are our priority. We need to put in the lawbooks the values we hold in our hearts. That makes good policy and good sense. 
These are the children of working families. Their parents may both be working 40-hour a week jobs. Jobs that put them over the poverty level but offer no benefits. This problem is pervasive. Nine out of ten children without insurance live in families with working parents. Two thirds of uninsured children live in families with incomes above the poverty line. The problem cuts across class and race. 
As I travel through my own State, working parents tell me how they worry about their children not having health insurance. They are afraid that they won't be able to take them to the doctor when they get really sick. With this bill, American parents won't have to fear for their children. This legislation meets the peace of mind test. 
I want to make sure children's health care needs are met comprehensively and equitably. This bill stands up and challenges what is wrong with our health care system. It affirms our need to develop human capital as well as economic capital. It's about getting our priorities straight and putting families first. I salute the Minority Leader for moving this important issue forward.
