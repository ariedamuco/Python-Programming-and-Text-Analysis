Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to commend Chairman McConnell for the work he has done on the foreign operations portion of the Omnibus Appropriations bill. 
The fiscal year 1999 foreign operations appropriations package is very different in size and character from the wasteful ones passed just a few years ago by liberal Congresses. It represents a sea change in the way Congress does business and a major victory for conservative, commonsense principles.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to commend the leadership and the members of the Appropriations Committee for their hard work on this bill. They had to make hard decisions about scarce resources and have labored to do so fairly. I also appreciate the efforts to make sure the taxpayers hard-earned dollars are spent effectively and efficiently. While there are several provisions within this bill which I wholeheartedly support, I do not agree with every provision of this bill. 
As you all may be aware, section 315 of the Interior portion of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 authorized the Recreational Fee Demonstration program. The Recreational Fee Demonstration Program is currently scheduled to expire on September 30, 1999. Language from the House Fiscal Year 1999 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act to extend this demonstration program an additional two years (to the year 2001) has been included in the FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act. I worked to keep similar language out of the Senate Interior appropriations bill and was disappointed to see the House language prevail in the final omnibus bill. 
The issue here is that the House action was premature. I am not totally opposed to a fee demonstration program. In fact, when Congress authorized the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program in 1996, I voted in support of this legislation and have been a proponent of user-based fees. I believe that the program, in concept, has merits. I envisioned this demonstration program as having the potential to improve the condition and recreation services of public lands by making more financial resources available to areas that are used the most heavily, based on a modest fee allocated to those directly benefitting from the enjoyment of those lands. Recreation is important in Idaho. Because 63 percent of our state is managed by the federal government, a majority of this recreation must take place on the public lands. In some of our premier areas the resource is being loved to death. Appropriated budgets will not see future large increases in recreation programs even though these areas will undoubtedly continue to be a popular local, and tourist, attraction. 
As a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, the authorizing committee with legislative jurisdiction over the fee demonstration program, as well as the chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction, I am committed to thorough oversight of this program with an eye toward consideration of any appropriate legislation to improve, continue, or terminate it depending on the information we gather and the experiences of the agencies. 
On June 11, 1998, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee held an oversight hearing on the program's first full year of implementation. Valuable information was gathered from the agencies administering the programs and the users of the resource. We will continue to monitor this program during the next two years. A thorough review of the program, with answers to some serious questions, must be completed before extending the recreation fee demonstration program. Then we can accurately assess the merits and problems and decide how to continue. However, considering this issue settled at this early date will only lessen the authorizing committee's responsibility to evaluate the program and make any improvements that are warranted. We should act after, not before, this demonstration program has had a chance to demonstrate. 
While I voted in favor of this bill for continuing necessary programs, some provisions, such as a premature extension of the recreation demonstration program, are not something I agree with or support. If more time is needed to test the fee demonstration project, it would have been more appropriate to extend the program nearer the end of three-year period rather than after only the first full year of the program. However, I will continue aggressive oversight of this program in an effort to improve it and possibly end it in areas where it clearly is not working.

Mr. CRAIG. As a sponsor of the Udall Act and supporter of Parkinson's research funding, I appreciate the Chairman's interest in these matters. The NIH claimed to spend more than $89 million on Parkinson's research in 1997. The Congress set a baseline authorization of $100 million for Parkinson's research in the fiscal year 1998 bill making NIH appropriations and clearly stated in report language that Congressional intent was to increase the commitment of NIH resources to Parkinson's. Close review of NIH's Parkinson's funding practices indicates that most of the research funding they define as Parkinson's is, in fact, not focused on Parkinson's at all. The NIH claimed to spend more than $89 million on Parkinson's research, in FY 1997. In reality, we later discovered that less than $31 million--just more than one third--of that research was truly focused on Parkinson's. Obviously there seems to be some disconnect here. Congress needs to be as clear as possible when communicating our intent to NIH, and diligent when overseeing their funding practices with regard to Parkinson's. I agree with Senator Cochran that hearings should be held early next year to address these issues, and I look forward to working with him, the Chairman, and others to see this resolved.

Mr. CRAIG. Let me thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for yielding time. I think he has probably been here on the floor, as I have, for the last few minutes to watch, at least by rhetoric, a very large piece of appropriations grow well beyond the dimension of reality, more into the dimension of hyperbole. 
Let us talk about reality for a few moments, because I suspect that there is no Senator on this floor who will today or tomorrow express a great appreciation for the process under which we are now concluding this Congress--by the bringing together under an omnibus appropriations bill a variety of appropriations bills that should have been dealt with, one by one, on an individual basis. 
That would have been the desire of every Senator on this floor. It would have also been the desire of every Senator on this floor, if we had not had 128 filed cloture motions in the last 4 years--cloture motions that were the result of the other side denying or filibustering given provisions of the process that ate up phenomenal amounts of time. That is not an excuse for anything. That is an expression that there is enough blame to go around for any of the process that gets criticized today by any Member who comes to this floor. It takes 60 votes in the Senate--if someone does not want the process to go forward, for that process to be denied to them--to require then the action on any given piece of legislation. 
Time and time again, we were faced with the reality of having to file cloture. That is substantially more than was ever filed by Democrats because Republicans forced them to do that. It is the character of the difference--or should I say it is the character of the intensity of concern as it relates to the issues that came to the floor of the 105th Congress. I do not deny that. Those are facts. That is the reality of it. 
I also say, if the measurement is a `do-nothing Congress,' you are darn right. We cannot take HMOs and turn the world of medicine upside down, as some of our colleagues on the other side wanted us to do. 
We did not raise hundreds of billions of dollars of new taxes on middle America through a tobacco provision, as some of the folks on the other side of the aisle wanted us to do. And we did not take the right of free speech away from the average American in campaign finance reform, as most of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle wanted us to do. 
If we did nothing on those things, we did a heck of a lot for the freedom of the average citizen in this country. And that is what ought to be the responsibility of this Congress: to make darn sure that we do not trample on the constitutional rights of our citizens. And that we did not do, over the loud cry and protest of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
Now, what did we do? Because the American public has the right to know what the 105th Congress did. Did we balance the budget? You bet we did. 
In 1981, I introduced one of the first constitutional amendments to require a balanced budget on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. And the old dogs and the pundits at the time laughed and said, `Freshman Congressman, not in your lifetime will you ever see a balanced budget. Deficit spending is the way we stimulate the economy of this great country. It's the way we give out pork. It is the way we buy political favor. And it won't happen in your lifetime, Congressman Craig'--at that time. `You'll not see a balanced budget.' 
Well, in 1994, the American people spoke. And they spoke in a way they had never before. And that was to change the Congress from Democrat and liberal to Republican and conservative. And not in 10 years, and not in my lifetime--but in 4 years the budget is balanced. And what we are debating here is an appropriations process that balances the Federal budget and still leaves $60 billion, or near that, in surplus, to deal with the strengthening and saving of Social Security, and also to deal with some of the emergency expenditures that the White House said were absolutely necessary and that most of us agreed with. 
So criticize, if you will--and in any bill this big there is a world of criticism, if you want to be selective--but if you want to look at the biggest picture of all, and that is a fiscal policy in our country and a monetary policy that have meshed to bring one of the strongest economies in the history of the world together into the robust character that it is, then you ought to look at that. And that is called a balanced budget, that is called denying this President his $150 billion tax increase, and leaving more money in the pockets of the average citizens in our country, and especially the lower middle income working Americans. And that was not a Democrat Congress that did it; it was a Republican Congress. 
I am proud of that. If the Democrats want to call that a do-nothing Congress, then please call it what you think it is, but tell the truth. We don't get it from the White House; we don't get it from the President. 
We understand the reality of the work we do. The reality of the work we do--whether we like the process at hand --is that the budget is balanced, our Nation is in surplus, we will strengthen Social Security, and we didn't raise taxes on the backs of the American people. There isn't an economist in the world today who doesn't say if it wasn't for the U.S. economy, the world would be in a major recession, but it is because of the strength of our fiscal policy and our monetary policy combined that drives this great economic engine that has more Americans working than at nearly any time in modern history. 
What about the problems in the farmlands of America in agriculture? Many of my colleagues went home in August, like I did, to talk to our farmers, and found our farmers not in recession but in depression. Nearly every commodity price was at or below break even, and many of them were well below break even. We had tried to respond in June and July in a very bipartisan way. We came back in August, dedicated to responding more, and we did. Democrat and Republican joined alike. 
Now, we had a difference in philosophy. But in the end, we came together with tremendous benefit for production agriculture --both short term, cash-in-the-pocket to the farmer to pay his banker and to pay for his seed and fertilizer costs and, hopefully, to put food on the table for his family and to get ready to farm for next year. 
We also did something else. We said what we are doing is short term; let's do some long-term good. Let's do what we promised American agriculture we would do when we passed the 1996 farm policy known as Freedom to Farm. Let's give them some permanent management tools to assure that they can strengthen their economic well-being. We did that in this bill, in this bill that some of our colleagues say they will want to vote against because they haven't read the fine print. 
Permanent income averaging, accelerated 100-percent reduction for self-employed health care insurance premiums for both agriculture and small business--the same thing that big business has to write off their health care costs. Good management, good business. You are darn right it is. We offered it to them. We have also allowed them to reach back and pick up losses to carry forward, a tremendous help to production agriculture. I am proud of that. I think we ought to be because it was a promise made and a promise kept. 
We also dropped a couple of sanctions that were denying us the ability to sell some of our product in world markets, with the pledge from our chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee that will do even more of that next year. That was all done in a bipartisan way. We can pick around the edges and we can criticize the process, and my guess is there is lots of room for that. 
As a conservative, I am as much a critic of that as anyone. But I am also a realist. I am proud of a balanced budget and I am proud we have a surplus. I am excited that the surplus goes to strengthen Social Security and pay down our debt. And I am pleased that in a real sense we were able to address the problems of American agriculture. I am pleased that in a real sense we were able to address the problems of people who had lived in a crisis because of Mother Nature, and we responded to that. 
I also recognize that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle had a lot of heavy lifting to do when it came to trying to represent this White House. They wanted to talk about saving Social Security, yet the President never sent up one bill to address the Social Security problem. They wanted to rail on about taxes and teenage smoking, yet the President did not send up one bill to deal with it.

Mr. CRAIG. I thank my chairman for yielding. 
What I have talked about is the reality of the 105th Congress. Will it go down as a do-nothing Congress? Not if you read the facts. If you get caught in the political rhetoric and listen to it, you might be swayed a bit. But if you like balanced budgets, if you don't like to pay more taxes, if you don't want the Federal Government telling you what to do in a variety of areas--including health care--if you want to make sure that we develop and strengthen Social Security and provide for the future of our young people, if you want to assure us that you will work with us as taxpayers to keep the American food supply whole, then you would say that this Congress did something. 
Now, let me, for just a moment, talk about some of what we ought to do when we get back. There will be a new Congress. It will convene in January. It will be called the 106th. There is no question in my mind that we ought to address change. The rules of the Senate that we operate under today were not written by this Senator. They were, in large part, by Senators from the other side of the aisle. I, and other Senators on this side of the aisle, have not had the votes to change those rules. Some of those rules ought to change. Why should we take 60 votes to lower taxes? Why should we penalize ourselves for wanting to return money to the American people? We shouldn't. It only takes 51 votes to spend money; why should it take more than that to deny Congress the right to spend? Those are some changes that we ought to make. 
What we saw in this process in the last couple of weeks is something that I don't enjoy. The legislative and the executive branches are coequal branches of Government, but our budget and our appropriations process didn't work the way we wanted it to work. We could never engage the White House until they chose to be engaged. You heard on this floor, and it was a fact of life, that our President spent most of the year out of town. I am confident it wasn't too comfortable in the Oval Office because he spent most of his time out of town either in foreign countries or raising money for his colleagues. It wasn't until the last 3 weeks that we finally got his attention. It was only in the last 2 weeks that the White House finally came to the Hill to negotiate. That isn't the way it ought to be but that is the way it was. 
Did the President get some of what he wanted? Yes, he did. Did he get all of what he wanted? Absolutely not. In fact, he got little of what he wanted. 
All you hear about the President's gains are 100,000 teachers. I don't mind spending money for 100,000 teachers as long as it is under a formula where 30 percent of it doesn't stay in Washington to fund the Department of Education; in this instance it doesn't. It is block granted, in large part, back to the States and the local educational units. I don't think that is a Democrat idea. I think that is a Republican idea. I am proud of that. I think most of our colleagues, when they look at it, will be. 
We did something else that this President did not want. We put more money into defense. In 1986, after 6 years of voting for every defense budget from 1981 forward, I quit voting for defense and started voting against it because I thought we spent too much money. Four years ago, I, once again, started voting for defense appropriations at a time when our President wouldn't own up to the fact that he was sending our troops everywhere around the world and pulling that defense money from current operating budgets and depleting our readiness and denying our soldiers the kind of environment and lifestyle that I think they all deserve. 
Finally, this Congress and this negotiation process in the last 2 weeks said, `Mr. President, we are going to stop it whether you want to or not. We cannot deny our military its readiness if you are going to use it as a police force running all around the world.' And we put in more money. 
That process shouldn't have happened in a small room with a few negotiators, but it did. By the way, it wasn't in the dark of night; and by the way, the room wasn't closed. 
But by the character of where this White House caused us to go, that is ultimately how the process got conducted, with fewer than the whole process and fewer than all of those who should have been there. 
We have our work to do in the coming year, and I hope we can make some reforms. I am one that would like to see us streamline this process a good deal more and change some of the rules that allow for a more predictable outcome. But in the end, I am not going to be one standing on the street corner trying to beckon attention to the fact that the 105th Congress was some Congress that did nothing. We didn't do a lot of what some of our liberal colleagues wanted, and that is probably why they yell out today. We did not address the White House agenda in so many areas; we did not tax middle America; we did not take away flexibility from health care recipients; nor did we handcuff the provided. 
Most importantly, we balanced the budget. We left a surplus. We are directing it at Social Security. I believe that is a hallmark, and I think the 105th Congress can be credited with doing more for the American economy and more for the working people of our country by keeping them employed in good, high-paying jobs and not taking more out of their pocket than any other Congress in history. That is a record I will stand by. That is a record I think most of our colleagues will want to stand by. If you believe as I do, then I think you ought to vote `yes' tomorrow--`yes' on an appropriations process that is finalized, with all of those hallmarks of accomplishment and success and a balanced budget, and an economy that is strong, and a work force in America that is working, and a sense of security and well-being that has not been felt in decades. I am proud of that, and I credit the 105th Congress for delivering it. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as you know, hurricane Georges recently caused great damage to the island of Puerto Rico. I would like to take this opportunity to personally express my sympathies to those who suffered loss due to this natural disaster. I would also like to clear up some confusion regarding the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the federal agency currently working to alleviate the pain and suffering caused by the hurricane. 
I recently learned that erroneous reports regarding the funding of FEMA have been circulating in Puerto Rico. A few elected officials in the commonwealth have stated to the press that funding for the FEMA program is obtained from local taxes and user fees within Puerto Rico. These reports are simply not true. 
On the contrary, the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent Agencies has sole jurisdiction over the funding of FEMA, and the funds appropriated by the committee come from the general fund. The general fund is composed of the collection of federal taxes and user fees from taxpaying citizens of the United States. 
The United States Congress is committed to continuing our efforts to aid our fellow American citizens in Puerto Rico in their time of need. We will continue to seek additional emergency disaster relief funding for FEMA before Congress adjourns.

Mr. CRAIG. Let me thank my colleague from North Dakota for those kind words. While he and I might disagree on policy as it relates to how we respond to American agriculture, we did not disagree and we do not disagree on the need. There are consequences if we fail to respond to that need at a time when markets are being taken away from production agriculture in this country. We have seen dramatic declines in commodity prices across the board. 
He and I agree on Canadian trade policy. We are very frustrated by what appears to be a one-way flow of commodities out of Canada with very little moving from our side into Canada; and when it attempts to move, finding all kinds of restrictions. 
I must tell the Senator from North Dakota I have been very frustrated with this administration, that they have not taken a more aggressive role in trying to determine why those differences have come about and responding to them. Thanks to our Governors, collectively, and our urging, the administration is now making some response in that area. I hope it is very, very productive. 
Canadians need to understand that under the North American Free Trade Agreement it is not a one-way street, nor should it be. 
I would agree also with my colleague from North Dakota as it relates to the response by the chairman of the Federal Reserve today. We probably would not differ on our concern over the analysis of the current world economic situation. I hope that our economy will respond to lower interest rates, but I must say that our economy also responds to tax cuts. Our economy also responds when consumers are having to pay less to their Federal Government and are allowed more of their own hard-earned money to stay in their pockets. 
But this administration was adamant this year, and we were unable to effectively respond to what I thought, and others thought, was a need for a reasonable tax cut in certain areas. There is an interesting analysis that we have just done as it relates to the obstructive nature of policy used on the floor of the Senate this year by our colleagues on the other side. In the last four years, the need for cloture--that is a term used here in a procedural effort to shut down a filibuster effort so that we can proceed to deal with a bill--had to be used four times more than in the preceding years under a Democrat-controlled Senate. In other words, there was a concerted effort this year by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to simply stop the process, to slow it down, to force cloture, to seek endless debates. 
So it becomes very frustrating when you are trying to do the business of the citizens, to move a timely budget process, a timely appropriations process that requires the necessary voting on 13 different appropriations bills to fund Government, to get it done when, day after day, debate is made on issues that are not relevant to the procedure and, in some instances, not relevant to the policy at hand. But that is a tactic that can be used and is legitimate before the Senate. I am not denying its legitimacy; I am denying the repetitiveness in which it was used as compared to the prior four years under a Democrat Senate, with George Mitchell as leader of the U.S. Senate. There has been nearly a four times greater need to file cloture so as to move the process forward. In other words, was there a directed effort to slow down the Congress, to slow down the Senate this year? I think the statistics and the history will clearly demonstrate that is the case. 
Be that as it may, it was important that we ultimately finish our work and that we adjourn. We are now on the eve of an adjournment because our work is done. We now have completed the appropriations process. We have done so in a way that dealt with the needs of this administration and the balance of power that, by Constitution, must and does occur in our Government. I will tell you that the end product isn't all that I would like, and there is a lot in it that I don't care for. But that is not unusual in any process where compromise is necessary to produce a final product. 
So I am pleased to say that that final product has been produced, that our majority leader labored mightily with the speaker, with representatives from the administration, and with representatives of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to resolve this issue. Should it have been done here on the floor in open debate? Yes. If we hadn't had to file over 100 cloture motions in the last four years, the process would have been much different. But that is the character of the Senate itself, and those are the rules under which we operate. Having to deal with those rules and the obstructive nature that can be applied to the process, I think we can declare a successful session. I hope that is the case in the end. 
Is the surplus produced by a balanced budget, which Republicans are proud of, intact? Yes, it is, by a very large amount. But it is also important to say that we never argued in the first place that all of the surplus would be held intact, and that it must be guaranteed to Social Security. That was a marker the President laid down. And while we agreed with him that there was adequate money in the surplus to reform Social Security for present and future purposes, it was the President that laid that marker down and, just in the last 48 hours, has tried to redefine what he meant by the marker. I am sorry, Mr. President, `is' is. Let me repeat that for the President. Mr. President, `is' is. We don't need to redefine it. We explain it. We totally understand it. We know what you said in your budget statement. All of the surplus went to Social Security, except you wanted about $20 billion of it to go somewhere else without getting blamed for it, and were simply saying that the argument is much different. We have used a very limited amount of moneys that we had not appropriated that could arguably be called surplus. 
But the surplus is intact. The budget is balanced. There is adequate money to begin what I think is a generational opportunity to not only assure and guarantee Social Security in the outyears beyond 2020 but, most importantly, to guarantee that it is done in a way so that our children and our grandchildren will not have to pay excessively to get a reasonable return on a guaranteed retirement annuity as Social Security has become. Those are the issues that we will deal with in a new Congress, and those are issues that are going to be paramount to the strength and stability of our country, and to the well-being of our citizens. I hope that we will deal with them in a reasonable and bipartisan fashion, because the correct solution to Social Security must be bipartisan by its nature and by its definition, and I am sure that we can accomplish that. 
Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for some months now, pressure has been building for the enactment of legislation that would address the long-neglected but widespread problem of religious persecution in a number of countries, notably persecution of Christians. This legislation, which has been approved by both Houses of Congress and has been sent to the White House, addresses that problem in a manner that will allow the flexibility to protect U.S. interests. Because there was no Committee Report for this legislation, it is important that appropriate guidance be given as to the intent behind the legislation, for the benefit both of the Executive Branch and, in particular, the Commission established by the Act. As an original cosponsor of the legislation, I wish to supplement the Statement of Managers submitted by Mr. Nickles to draw particular attention to two provisions in the Act that address what is the fundamental duty of any government: to protect the rights of its own citizens. 
The primary purpose of this bill is to address the rampant persecution in many foreign countries by the governments of those countries against their own people. But however repugnant we find persecution of citizens of foreign countries--and properly so--it is even worse when we find that the U.S. government has too often turned a blind eye to violations of Americans' religious freedom by persecuting regimes. For example, the State Department has collaborated with the denial of religious freedom by shutting down Christian services on the premises of the U.S. Consulate in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) and punished a whistle-blowing State Department official who protested. Similarly, the State Department has refused to take any meaningful action to secure the release of an unknown number of minor U.S. citizens who have been kept from leaving Saudi Arabia and who have been forcibly converted to Islam. This is an especially acute problem in the case of girls, who will not be able to leave Saudi Arabia even after reaching the age of majority--in effect, theirs is a life sentence. 
This bill addresses both of these issues, and the intent of Congress is clear. First, the bill requires the State Department to report on both practices as they affect the rights of American citizens (section 102(b)(1)(B) (i) and (ii)). This report should be detailed and specific both as to the nature of the violations and the remedial actions that have been applied. Second, because forced religious conversion is among the violations that mandate presidential action under this bill, documentation of the victimization of minor U.S. citizens in this manner by any foreign government should be of particular note in the President's decision to take action. Third, section 107 mandates access for U.S. citizens to diplomatic missions and consular posts for the purpose of religious services on the same basis as the many other nongovernmental activities unrelated to the diplomatic mission that frequently are permitted access. Fourth, the Commission should take particular note of Congress' intent in the provisions relating to violations of Americans' rights in making its recommendations and should be strict in reviewing U.S. government policies in this area. And fifth, notice of these violations of U.S. citizens' rights should prompt a thorough review of the Department of State's too-often dismissive attitude toward these concerns in comparison to its desire to cultivate good relations with foreign governments.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have just heard the Republican majority leader outline in brief the negotiations between the White House and the Congress as it relates to a final package of fiscal affairs for this Government for the coming year. 
Over the course of the last several days, I have had the opportunity to attend a variety of those negotiations, and on occasion, based on my certain areas of knowledge, to be consulted as to what directions we might head. 
I thought for a few moments this morning I would discuss briefly the agricultural package, because it is one of those major areas of concern and dispute for a period of time up until late last evening--that, of course, and the educational package that most of our colleagues are now becoming aware of. 
While the final language on the agricultural package is being put together, there are some fundamental principles we adhered to that I think are important for our colleagues to understand when they begin to examine this package for their final consideration of it tomorrow. 
First and foremost, it is important to recognize that this Republican Congress back in May and June began to recognize the very critical situation that American agriculture was in and the character of the decline in commodity prices that was evident out there, along with loss of foreign markets, that was producing what I consistently called on the floor of this Senate and across my State of Idaho an `agricultural crisis.' 
It was in late June that I, along with six other Senators and the majority leader, sat down with about 15 commodity group representatives in this community, representing national agricultural commodity groups, to examine the crisis from their perspective and to look at a variety of things that we might do here within current policy and current budget constraints to deal with the crisis, recognizing that if we weren't responsive, we would see many of our farmers on the edge of bankruptcy, and potentially by next crop season they would be out of production. That is not good for America. It is not good for our economic base or for the food-consuming public. 
Fewer farmers mean larger farmers, usually, or fewer farmers with larger acreages. And in many instances what we find is large corporations buying up smaller production units that find themselves in bankruptcy. 
Consistently we have looked at farm policy recognizing the need to keep farm families intact and a production unit in American agriculture that was sympathetic to the American farm family. So it was with that spirit in mind that we met with these commodity groups and came up with a list of items that we would attempt to be responsive to. 
First and foremost in the general discussion with that commodity group was to keep the current farm policy in place, keep the 1996 farm bill, better known as Freedom to Farm, in place. It is working. It gives farmers greater flexibility to decide what to farm, what to grow, and how to deal with market trends. It does so with less Government interference, less opportunity to farm to a Government program instead of farm to what the market is demanding, what the consuming market is demanding. That became a premise of operation for us here in the Senate--that we would not violate or attempt to go in and offer dramatic changes to farm policy. 
Immediately before the August recess, we responded by reaching out and putting more of what we call the AMFTA payments into this year's current payment to bump up some money that would go directly back to that farmer and to that production unit. 
Most of us, of course, in August visited our farmers, and we came back clearly with the understanding that we were in a crisis, that the commodity prices were at a 20-year low, many times below the cost of production, and that the loss of Asian markets, the loss of markets in Central and South America, was also driving this decline in commodity prices. 
There was also a large influx of product coming in from Canada, which was part of a program of opening the borders for the North American Free Trade Agreement. And we had to be sensitive to that. 
But, most importantly, what our farmers were telling us, along with the decline in commodity prices, was that when we had put the 1996 farm policy in place, we had also said at that time there would be other things we would have to do. We would have to review trade policy. We would have to look at the cold war policy coming out of World War II that put sanctions on a variety of countries and basically took 13 to 20 percent of the world market out of reach of production agriculture by one or another sanctions that were built up as a product of foreign policy statements and/or policy laws in this country that we had to review. 
Most immediate, when we came back in August, was the need to deal with the inability to trade with Pakistan and India based on the confrontation they were having and the nuclear tests they were engaged in, which was a direct violation of the nuclear test ban and, of course, the provisions we had put in there that would disallow us trading with or dealing with countries that were in violation. We were able to strike those two sanctions down immediately, which then in a near immediate sense put in play major sales of soft white wheat out of the Pacific Northwest. Those sales have gone forward, and they have been very helpful to production agriculture nationwide. 
We also said--and Chairman Lugar, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said--we have to look at the overall need to review sanctions, the attempted sanctions legislation. There were some modifications in it, but it was not complete. He knows it; we know it. 
One of our jobs coming back next year will be to take a serious look at the post-World War II era sanctions that have taken a large chunk of the world market away from our farmers, because in Freedom to Farm we said: You are going to be free to farm, and we are going to use the political clout, the governmental clout, of your country to open up these world markets to assist you. And we would look at another provision. 
That is the very provision that the negotiations moved toward in the past several days. That was a tax component--a tax provision that said to production units: You are cyclical by nature. By that I mean, 1-year commodity prices are at an all-time high and the next year they are at an all-time low. Those who have ever farmed--and I farmed during my other life as a private citizen--know that very well, that some years you make money and in other years you lose a lot of money. It is simply because of oversupply and then undersupply of certain commodities within the market. 
As a result, we had historically said, up to 1986, that tax laws should reflect that you ought to be able to reach back and pull forward some of those losses into a crop year where there are high profits; you ought to be able to income average those kinds of things out. In 1986 we took that out--or I should say a Democrat Congress took that out--of the tax policy of that year, in my opinion badly handicapping and creating long-term injury to production agriculture. Last year we did some tentative work in that area putting income averaging back. 
But the package that our colleagues will have a chance to review tonight and tomorrow as a final work product of this Congress will have made permanent the permanent income average, which is a key component to agriculture. Someone on the other side suggested to us that doesn't solve the immediate problem. No, it doesn't. But we put $5.97 billion in to solve the immediate problem directly flowing through to production agriculture. But what we have to look at is the long-term character that we had promised production agriculture when we changed the farm bill. And we do that--permanent income averaging, a 5-year carryback provision allowing farmers to account for, as I expressed a moment ago, the cyclical character or future of production agriculture. 
Then we went in and did some technical corrections to IRS tax laws, because, for example, when a farmer is guaranteed a Government payment but the payment doesn't come until a certain time, the Government wants to tax you on the payment at the moment that you are eligible for it. We say no; that payment should occur at that time. 
The bill that is being reviewed now also recognizes the kind of drought that your State of Florida had, Mr. President, and Texas and other parts of the southeastern part of the United States, Georgia. And there are $3 billion in there to deal with economic disasters. That will be critically important. 
Between the payments that were scheduled in the Freedom to Farm 1996 farm policy, along with recognizing the crisis created by loss of foreign markets and the typical natural cycling of our environment and our weather, we are going to recognize all of that. 
I will conclude by saying this. We preserve current farm policy because American agriculture told us they needed that to happen for the flexibility of future years. We have also kept some promises that we made in 1996, to begin to look at sanctions and to free up opportunity in world markets. And also, most important, the third passage dealt with tax--tax law flexibility, so that that production unit, that farmer or rancher, can deal with the cyclical character of his or her markets on good years versus bad years. So they pay their fair share in taxes but they do not pay taxes one year on substantial profits and then the next year have tremendous losses that put them in a bind. 
They used to understand that. That is the way the law used to be. With that flexibility, you kind of store it up in the good years to offset your needs in the bad years. That is the way agriculture ought to operate, and that is the way our tax laws ought to allow them to operate. 
I thought I would give that synopsis of what we are doing and what I think is important for our taxpayers to understand. Keeping this tremendous production unit in our country--known as agriculture--healthy and producing is of critical importance to our country. The American consumers today pay less for food than any other item they buy. As a result of that, our consuming public has more spendable income to buy cars, to buy homes, to provide for their children's education. They are not paying 30 percent or 40 percent or 50 percent or 60 percent of their income for food. They are paying 13 to 14 percent, for the highest quality, safest, richest foods in the world. That is a result of this marvelous production unit we call American agriculture. 
I am proud that this Republican Congress, working with our colleagues on the other side, represented that understanding in the current policy that is embodied in this omnibus bill with which we will be dealing. It is an important area. I am glad our leaders were sensitive to it and that we can turn to agriculture and say: We didn't save you, we didn't guarantee you, but we recognize the need to shore up, in those areas of disaster, and to assure that those units of production--and those are family farms; these are people, men and women and their children who oftentimes work from daylight to dark--are going to be held as whole as we can possibly keep them at a time when farm commodities, because of certain situations here and around the world, have plummeted to nearly 25- and 30-year lows. 
Mr. President, let me run through a few unanimous consent requests cleared by both sides of the aisle.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, on Friday there will be a period of morning business until 11 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate may consider any legislative items that can be cleared by unanimous consent. The Senate is expected to begin debate in relation to the omnibus appropriations bill at some point during Friday's session, while awaiting receipt of the actual papers from the House. It is still the hope that it can be disposed of by unanimous consent. However, if a rollcall vote is required, it will not occur prior to 5 p.m. on Friday evening. 
If the President will remember, our majority leader had agreed that he would offer our colleagues a 24-hour notice. Certainly, without additional information coming from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to make that determination, the 5 o'clock time specified here could well advance into the evening to assure the commitment of our majority leader that our colleagues have that 24 hours. So Members will be given appropriate notification as to the exact time of that vote in relation to when we can offer that announcement today, or late into the evening today.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, last night there was an interesting discussion on CNN. It went something like this: 
The White House is now spending the surplus--the surplus that the President, a few months ago, said had to be guaranteed for only Social Security. I am told that the White House immediately responded by saying: Oh, no, no, no, the White House isn't spending the surplus. Surpluses don't exist until after you have had all of the emergency spending you need. 
In other words, the White House has now come to the Hill to ask for upwards of $20 billion worth of surplus spending that is now emergency spending, that isn't called surplus and, therefore, doesn't count against application to the trust funds of Social Security. 
Now, while the President's legions are up here in negotiations over in Speaker Newt Gingrich's office, the President is still out on the stump accusing Republicans of wanting to spend the surplus. The President has effectively, by Democrat action here on the floor, denied the taxpayers a reasonable tax cut this year. And while there are some necessary moneys to be spent in surplus spending for emergencies--such as disaster-related emergencies, the emergency of the commodity price crises in agriculture--nobody has denied that that wasn't surplus money and that in fact we are spending a little bit of that surplus, a very small amount 
of that surplus, to address some very real national needs. But no Republican has even tried to suggest that the surplus isn't the surplus until we have spent all of it, or a portion of it, and that what is left over becomes the surplus. 
Mr. President, this is a doublespeak of yours that we are somehow, as a Nation, getting used to: Is `is'? No; the surplus is the surplus. That is the money that remains unappropriated at the end of a fiscal year. That is the money that, collectively, the budget process of Congress, the appropriating process of Congress, says is not needed; it is not necessary to spend that money. 
So now we are attempting something uniquely different. Now we are attempting to once again redefine, at least in the eyes of the President and this administration, what a surplus is. I think we will let the American people decide what that is. You see, we know what `is' is. And `is,' in this case, is the money that the budget process suggests is not appropriated beyond its normal channels, and that we have determined can be upward of $60 billion worth of surplus this year, that the President in his budget message to Congress emphatically said had to be spent on Social Security, and that this Congress, in a very real and bipartisan way, said, yes, it is a good idea and should be done, because most of us agree that we are in a unique time--if not a historically opportune time--in our country, and that is to use our surplus, to use the surplus that was produced by a balanced budget that we worked so hard to accomplish--can be used to make major changes, not only in our tax law and tax policy, but now the unique opportunity to reform Social Security, not only to save it, secure it, and maintain it for those who become the immediate recipients of it, but so that our children and our grandchildren will be investing in a Social Security system that is worth investing in, so that they are not denied real return on their investment--25 cents on the dollar, as will be the case for our grandchildren today if we don't reform Social Security. We want them to get $1.50 or $2 back on their investment, as they should be allowed to do. 
So what is `is,' Mr. President, and what is surplus doesn't allow your definition. It isn't what is left over when you get through spending on all of the additional social programs that you want to spend it on. 
Just a few moments ago, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle held a very interesting press conference. They called it a `do-nothing Congress.' They denied that we had spent the money necessary to fund all of the social programs. Mr. President, in 1994 the American people spoke most profoundly when they changed Congress and said they wanted a new agenda, they wanted a balanced budget, they wanted us to reform Social Security, and they wanted the influence and the impact of the Federal Government on our lives and on our pocketbooks lessened. That is exactly what this Congress has been doing. Yet, of course, now that we have accomplished those goals, now that our economy and our lessened Government spent less of the money and our economy generates more money and we have a unique opportunity of surplus, the President now sees that opportunity--sees it or seizes it, I am not sure at this moment. 
Let me suggest, Mr. President, that what is is. Surplus is surplus. It isn't what is left over after you get through spending. That is exactly what the President and the White House tried to engage in last night, a whole new definition. We have watched this President try to redefine a lot of things over the last good number of months--from the word `is,' now to the word `surplus.' Mr. President, surplus is surplus. It is when the Congress works the budget process, and that is concluded in a bipartisan fashion, that we determine what surplus is. So I think it is terribly important that we finalize our work here. Those negotiations are now underway. Yes, some surplus money will be spent in emergency. 
What is left over at the end will be surplus. But you don't start the game by redefining the fact. That is how we deal with it. That is how we must deal with it. And it is very important that we stay with that. 
I am proud of the record of the Republican Congress--a balanced budget, welfare reform--major changes--and new dollars into education, education controlled at the local and State level and not new, grand programs here at the national level. Those are the issues about which we are talking. Those are the issues with which we must deal. 
I hope we can conclude those quickly, adjourn this Congress, and be able to announce to the American taxpayer that they can rest assured that our effort is to control Government spending, the size of Government, and the impact it has on their pocketbook. 
With those comments, I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today the Senate will begin a period of morning business until 1:00 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate may consider any legislative items that can be cleared by unanimous consent. 
Also, it is expected that the House will send over a 1- or 2-day continuing resolution which the Senate would take up and pass by unanimous consent. The negotiations with respect to the omnibus appropriations bill are still going on, and it is still the hope of the majority leader that the bipartisan bill can be agreed to by unanimous consent. 
Once again, in the event a rollcall vote is requested on the funding bill, all Members will be immediately notified. 
The majority leader thanks all of our colleagues for their attention.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- N O T I C E   If the 105th Congress adjourns sine die on or before October 16, 1998, a final issue of the Congressional Record for the 105th Congress will be published on October 28, 1998, in order to permit Members to revise and extend their remarks.

It was a dramatic vote in the sense that Senators were voting their conscience about where the public wanted the educational dollar to go, not to get bound up in the Federal bureaucracy and have a lot of it spun off here, as the President apparently would want, but for that money to move right back to local units of education. Is that not true, and was that not the goal of this Congress?

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, a great deal has been talked about here this afternoon as to what this Congress and our President will do on the issue of education. I am, once again, pleased to see our President engaged and spending time talking about education. He spent so much time skipping class and trying to avoid detention that he failed to learn about what Republicans and the majority here in Congress have been doing on behalf of education for the last good many months. 
It is with that in mind that I would like to, for a few moments, talk about what we have done and what is being done. I am pleased that the President is once again engaged. We finally got his attention in the last week. He is staying in the White House and trying to work with us to resolve some of these issues. That is important. It is time that Congress adjourn, but most important, we must finish our work before we go. 
The President did come home on occasion to veto a few bills this year, but he seems to have forgotten them. He seems to have forgotten the Coverdell A+ education bill that he vetoed, which would have provided educational savings accounts, would have allowed parents to set aside $2,000 a year per child for educational expenses, and teacher testing and merit pay would reward teachers for their performance in the classroom. That was part of the bill that he vetoed. It also included dollars to the classroom, which would put money directly from the Federal Government into helping students instead of the bureaucrats. It is interesting that my colleagues on the other side, a few moments ago, introduced information about what GAO said. Let me tell you what the Federal Government said, 
what the Department of Education said about its own problems with paperwork and the burning up of valuable educational dollars. The U.S. Department of Education estimates that it takes approximately 48.6 million paperwork hours--the equivalent of almost 25,000 employees working 40 hours a week for a full year--to complete the paperwork involving the administration of the Federal education programs. The Senator from Washington spoke about the amount of time that local units of education use filling out the paperwork. 
In my State of Idaho, as is true in Iowa, Ohio or any other State across the Nation, 50 percent of its paperwork burden is directly related to the 5 percent of the money that it gets. What happened? The President vetoed it. He came home, focused for a few moments, vetoed it, and left town again. 
What about the tax regarding the College Tuition Program, encouraging parents to save for their child's college education? That, too, was vetoed by the President. 
So when this President stands up and says, `I want billions of dollars more for education,' what he is saying is, `I want billions of dollars more here in Washington to be run through a Federal system to be directed out for education,' while this Senate voted, by a majority, to do quite the opposite--to literally turn the public loose to fund education without Federal strings. 
Eighty-four percent of Federal elementary and secondary education funds are used for instruction, according to the April 1998 report by the U.S. Department of Education. What happened to the other percentage? Let's see. I guess that would be 16 percent. What happened? Overhead and administration. That is what it cost to get the money out. 
You see, there is a game played in this town. It is how big you can build the agency and how many times you can roll the paper before you send the money out. 
That is exactly what this Congress tried to avoid. That is exactly what we did avoid with legislation passed by this Senate and passed by the House and vetoed by this President. 
Now that we are attempting to adjourn our Congress, just in the last few days the President is home back in school, not avoiding classes, and he is trying to spend, or spin his story about education. 
Mr. President, why did you veto all of these productive pieces of legislation that were passed by a majority, a bipartisan majority, in Congress? Why did you veto legislation that, when polled, well over 60 percent of the American people said it gave more power to the family, to the parent, to the local education school board? That is what America wants. They don't want 100,000 federally paid-for teachers and a bureaucracy to go along, and over 20 percent of the money staying right here to be spent on thousands and thousands of hours of paperwork. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks concerning the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act. Most Americans believe that should control their health care to the greatest extent possible. Others continue to favor comprehensive federal control of seniors, health care which results in rationing. All patients should be able to choose their own doctors and have complete freedom to supplement their insurance, including Medicare, as they see fit. The right of seniors to pay out of their own pocket for the health care of their choice is an essential element of our nation's concept of liberty. 
Under this Act, Medicare would pay the standard fee for the standard procedures by the standard practitioner with private contracting reserved for more specialized procedures. While it would be a right that--because of economics--would be exercised only in special circumstances, private contracting is a basic right every senior should have. And importantly, it would provide a safeguard from government manipulation--something which under the Clinton Administration is an all-too-real possibility. 
Under this act, seniors would be even less likely to privately contract than they are to go to nonparticipating physician, because with private contracting they agree to pay the full cost of the service themselves (just as they historically have.) In fact, if the desire to pay out-of-pocket were widespread, seniors wouldn't join Part B (which is voluntary) at all. But seniors overwhelmingly choose Part B insurance--just as most other Americans do in choosing doctor-visit coverage in their health plans. 
President Clinton said in the State of the Union that all Americans must have the right to doctor choice, and assess to specialists without referral. Why not seniors, too? 
Mr. President, I believe that Americans are right when they tell me in letters and phone calls and personal visits that they do not want to be trapped by a one-tiered Medicare program. I think I am correct in stating that senior citizens over age 64 are right in being angry at all members of Congress and the Clinton Administration for denying them their right to make any medical choice for themselves, to see any physician they want for any service they want if they want to spend their own money. It is for this reason, that I ask all my colleagues to work with us to restore to seniors their right to privately contract for any medical service with physicians of their choice. I look forward to working with the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth, and other Members of the Senate toward that goal.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with a revelation that I suspect will come as a bit of a surprise to some of my colleagues and to a few Americans. Mr. President, fellow Senators and fellow Americans, President Bill Clinton, is in town. That is right. The President is actually in the White House today. 
For any who have followed the President's extensive travel throughout his term in office, you would notice that I say his `time in Washington' because that has been far less than his term in office. The fact that the President has actually planned to stay in town for a week is, in my opinion, a bit newsworthy. 
The President is supposed to be the head of our country. Instead, I suspect that Bill Clinton has been our country's feet. This President is already the most foreign-traveled President in U.S. history, with 32 trips abroad in less than 6 years in office. In just the last 2 years, he has spent 79 days overseas. Those 79 days abroad in 2 years are almost as many days as President Bush spent during his 4 years in office. 
If and when he has come home to the United States does not mean that he came home to the White House. President Clinton spent almost half of last year, 149 days, and over half of this year, now 155 days, out of the White House. What has he been doing while logging those frequent flier miles on Air Force One? Well, a lot has been fundraising; 65 days over just the last 2 years have included out-of-town fundraising trips, and 14 more are planned for this month alone. 
Now the President is back in town for one of his rare weeks in Washington. What did he do on his first day at work yesterday? He sought, once again, to divert attention from his own problems--this time, by threatening to shut down the Government. It is hard to tell if this President has come back to town to simply repack his bags or to take, or attempt to take, Congress hostage. 
President Clinton appears intent on making the sequel to the movie `Wag the Dog.' The President hasn't participated in the process of government at all this year, and now he returns, seemingly, to attempt to shut the process down. I have to say I think this is a bit of diversion. I don't believe it is leadership. 
Is it unfair to criticize? Is it partisan to be harsh? I asked myself that question before I came to the floor this morning. I don't think so. Here is why I don't think so. Consider just two issues that we all believe are important issues, that even the President has acknowledged are important. 
In just a few moments we are going to resume debate on a most important piece of legislation, the agricultural appropriations. It is on that that I want to speak for just a few moments, an issue that President Clinton once ignored. He ignored solutions to help farmers and ranchers. He didn't speak about them in his first term of office and has spoken little about them in his second term. Now we have legislation that we think will help farmers and ranchers, and on his first week back in town he says `I'll veto it.' 
`Agriculture' is a word that this President hasn't found a place for in his vocabulary. Why? Because American farmers make up less than 3 percent of the American public. They don't have as much political clout as they once had. So this President hasn't addressed this issue. But just now, when American agriculture is in crisis and this Congress, in a bipartisan way, is attempting to find solutions to that crisis, our President comes to town, finds his footing, and says, `I'll veto the effort.' 
Mr. President, that is fair if you had been part of the process, if you had been in here working with us, if there had been legitimate give-and-take and finally a breakdown. That is not the case at all. 
The President was absent--traveling, fundraising--away from what is most important. So he seeks now to make up for his absence by having not just one position on agriculture but three positions. First of all, he asked for about $2.3 billion in assistance on September 22. That was just 2 weeks ago. Congress then roughly doubled that amount. Yet now, to hide the fact that he had not been paying attention to American agriculture, President Clinton is demanding more, much more--nearly $7 billion. 
And now he threatens to veto legislation that Congress will send to him--legislation that will give twice the money that he asked for less than a month ago. 
For 2 years, he has failed to use the tools that could have addressed the agriculture problems in substantial ways. He has ignored the tools--tools that I have requested the President not let rust away in some storage shed down at USDA, tools of trade, tools of trade intervention, humanitarian aid. All of those kinds of things that would have moved our products into the market were not used and have gathered rust and sat idle. Why, then, is the President coming back almost in an effort to demand a scorched-Earth policy? Is it politics, or is it the wag factor that is now at work? I am not sure. But, Mr. President, I think you have little credibility in this area. 
Let me discuss just one other area briefly. I know the Senator from West Virginia is waiting.

Mr. CRAIG. There is the issue of Social Security. So important was it that the President declared it in his State of the Union Address as an effort to save Social Security. Yet, the President has not bothered to make one step in that direction. The Congress waited a year, but no plan came from the White House. Just as with the farm crisis, he has only managed to use it--not address it, much less solve it. Like the farm crisis, he sought to use it to turn attention from himself. Instead of buckling down, this President has traveled around; over half of the days of this year the President has been out of town. He has found time to travel, he has found time to go overseas, he has found time to fundraise; but he has not found time to send any one plan to save Social Security to the Congress of the United States, or any one plan to alleviate a farm crisis that is now emerging. 
Well, I suspect that if the solution to Social Security had been in Beijing, or Chile, or Ghana, or Uganda, or Rwanda, or South America, he might have found it there because that is where the President was. Why now, the last week that Congress plans to be in session, with a schedule that was established at the first of the year, did the President find his way back to the White House to sit and only threaten--threaten to veto here, threaten to veto there? 
Mr. President, are you planning to shut down the Government? Is it a plan for diversion? Is it a plan to hide? Well, we have some problems and we are going to work to solve them. Those solutions should come in a bipartisan way. Mr. President, I hope you will be a part of the solution. The American people deserve nothing less than that. 
I don't like coming to the floor to give these kinds of speeches, but sometimes I feel they are important. Sometimes I feel it is important for the American people to recognize, as we do, that there are times when we work together and not times when we simply find our footing to threaten or to change the subject or to divert attention. 
Is the Presidency in crisis today? Yes, it is. We all know why it is. That is a constitutional tragedy. That will work its will. The House is underway in that process. Let us be allowed to work our will to solve the problem of financing our Government for the coming year. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me join with my chairman, Senator Thad Cochran, chairman of the Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee, who spoke with a certain amount of frustration in his voice just a few moments ago. He has every reason to be frustrated. 
This chairman has bent over backwards in the last 6 months trying to understand and address the agricultural crisis that is now upon America's production agriculture. He has joined with us--those of us here in the Senate who come from strong agricultural States--at every step along the way to see how we could resolve this under current policy. I don't blame his frustration. 
I came to the floor just a few moments ago to announce that the President is in town for the full week for the first time in a good many weeks, and the first thing he says is that he is going to veto the agriculture appropriations bill. I am critical of this President. Mr. President, wake up. You haven't had a position on agriculture your entire term in office. Now you say, `I'm going to veto,' at a time when this Congress has worked collectively, on a very strong bipartisan vote on the House side just last week, 333 House Members, Democrat and Republican, on the very issue that we have on the floor now that the chairman has spoken to and that we will vote on this afternoon. 
I am not quite sure why he is doing that. I suggested this morning that maybe it was a bit of `Wag the Dog.' I don't want to make accusations, but why isn't he helping us, working with us to resolve this, rather than simply addressing it with a veto threat. 
What has the bill to offer production agriculture? For the last several days, we have laid out the amount of money that is being spent that will go directly to farmers to offset the market losses that they have experienced, the very real and dramatic declines in commodity prices that are going to place some of our very good farmers and ranchers in bankruptcy. We want to be sensitive to that. This Congress is being sensitive to that with a $4.2 billion package. Payments directly to farmers who have experienced natural disasters--$1.5 billion for that--who through no fault of their own, have lost their crops; market loss payments, reflective of what has gone on in the Pacific Rim and the loss of markets there, payments of about $1.65 billion, directly down through to the farmer and the rancher; a multiple-year losses program of about $675 million; livestock feed assistance for those areas that were `droughted' out who obviously produced no feed for their livestock this year and are having to reach well outside their barriers and pay premium price for hay to be brought in; and, of course, emergency-related aid of about $200 million. This bill is very sensitive to the needs of production agriculture. 
What is the debate really about? Why would the President want to veto a bill that provides so much at a time of true need to production agriculture? As I said, it could be a `Wag the Dog' problem, but more importantly it is probably a debate over significant problems. 
We--Republicans--believe, and I think American agriculture supports a recognition that farmers ought to be farming to the market. The Freedom to Farm bill reflected that and we made significant change to policy. We also said government has a responsibility to break down the political barriers that the chairman spoke about to expand world trade, and yet the tools to do that are rusting down in the toolshed at USDA because they have failed to use them. Throughout the time this crisis was growing, not one kernel of grain was purchased for humanitarian purposes. 
Yet, the Secretary had the tools to do it. The Secretary had the tools to enhance trade for the purpose of moving the product that was stored out there on America's farms, or in America's granaries. Yet, that didn't happen. And now, all of a sudden, when we are trying to shape some form of aid to get us through this cropping season and keep what American farmers say is a good farm policy in place, the President takes time off from his world travels and his campaign fundraising events to say, `I am going to veto this bill.' 
Mr. President, I hope you will study it a bit and change your mind, because if you think you are going to use an additional $3 billion or $4 billion from the surplus that you want to put in Social Security to save Social Security, think again. It isn't necessary and it isn't needed, and I don't think this Congress is willing to provide it. Those are the realities with which we are dealing.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will take just a few moments because I want to sandwich some comments into this very important discussion on cutting taxes and lowering the rate of impact our Federal Government has on the average American family. The Senator from Missouri has spoken so very clearly today about what is happening, once again, in our Nation's capital. We fought for a decade to balance the budget--and Republicans are proud that it has now happened, it happened on our watch with our fiscal conservatism--but now we have a President who wants to throw up the facade of saving Social Security and yet sending a very large spending package to Capitol Hill. I hope we do have an opportunity to vote for tax cuts. This is one Senator who will proudly cast an `aye' vote for it.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thought it would be important this morning to do a short reality check on our President. The President last week said Congress is a do-nothing Congress. They have not done their work. Why has Congress not done its work? You know, when he made that comment about us--and I have been here hour after hour in committee meeting after committee meeting, here on the floor, day after day for the balance of the year--I thought, you know, Mr. President, you challenged me a little bit. It is time to do a reality check. So I sent staff scurrying. We compiled the President's travel log, and what I am about to report to you is the travel log of President Bill Clinton. 
For a man who is bent on remaining in the White House, President Clinton sure spends a lot of time away from the White House. What you are about to hear is an analysis of how much time he has spent away, and why his people have not been on the Hill, why they have not been working with us, and now in the closing hours of a Congress he is either threatening a veto or threatening that he might just have to shut down Government to awaken us. Mr. President, let's do a bit of a reality check. 
Last year, President Clinton broke the Presidential record for foreign travel with his 27th trip abroad. Like the Energizer Bunny, he has continued to keep on going and going and going. This year so far he has logged 41 days in 11 countries--11 different foreign countries. Some say he is traveling in foreign countries to keep his mind off domestic problems. I would not want to make that assertion. What I do know is that the President has now broken all-time Presidential travel records with 32 trips abroad, more than any other president ever. Mr. President, you are out breaking records. 
However, just because President Clinton is not on foreign soil all the time doesn't mean he is in the White House. Bill Clinton also likes to travel around the country as well. He is particularly fond of combining both domestic travel and campaign fundraisers, with at least 37 trips which include fundraisers just through this year, 1998, and there are at least 14 more fundraising events scheduled for October, according to reports. Stay tuned as I go down through this report, because you will find an anomaly between official travel and fundraising travel and what it is costing the taxpayers and maybe why he needs a little bit of supplemental spending. 
All told, the President has spent almost half of 1997, 149 days, as well as over half of 1998 so far, 155 days, outside of Washington, DC. Hello, Mr. President, we are trying to get our work done here. You criticize us for being a do-nothing Congress? Mr. President, where have you been? 
The President's travel at taxpayers' expense long ago broke the foreign travel record. To put it in perspective, Mr. President, you have traveled domestically over 304 days in the last 2 years. You have already spent more time out of Washington than four out of the last five Congresses have spent in session. 
If the implications were not so serious, the President's wanderlust would be a mere fact for amusement, and we could all chortle a little bit about it. This is, after all, a President who has claimed an initiative for every problem and credit for every solution. Yet the President has not been around for much of the work. If America is to believe he is serious about Social Security reform and Medicare reform and health care reform, tax reform and a host of other problems, it would help if they could first believe he is going to be here so we could meet with him to get the work done. 
In 1992, then-candidate Bill Clinton excoriated President Bush for taking 25 trips to 60 countries from 1989 to 1993. He stated, `It is time for us to have a President who cares more about Littleton, NH, than Liechtenstein; or more about Manchester than Micronesia.' But once in office, guess what? Mr. Clinton took Air Force One and away he went, and he broke the Bush record. In less than 2 years, 1997 through 1998, Clinton has spent almost as many days overseas as Bush spent during his entire term in office--79 versus 86 days. President Clinton has taken 32 foreign trips during his Presidency, 6 more than President Bush, to 78 countries, including 51 different ones. Trips to South Korea, Japan, Malaysia are already in the travel plans for next year. 
Mr. President, I could go on and on. The point is quite simple. As America has discovered, just because Mr. Clinton is in the country does not mean he is in the White House. The `DC' in Washington, DC, probably means `Devoid of Clinton.' While Clinton was able to leave his passport in the White House, he has made sure he has taken donor cards. As the press has noted, fundraising is prominent in his travel agenda. 
What is in the Washington Post today? The President was out once again, Friday, fundraising. I understand now the American people are waking up a little bit. Here is what one of the picket signs said as the President entered a fundraiser in Ohio: `Fundraising? Is this the people's work?' 
I am starting to ask the same thing. In 1997, President Clinton spent 111 days on the road on domestic travel. He has already surpassed that in 1998 with 114 days. In 1997, he used at least 28 of those trips for fundraising. Through September of this year, President Clinton has already used at least 37 of those days for fundraising. 
That is part of the story, but here is the rest of the story that really concerns me. Do you know how much it costs to fly Air Force One? Mr. President, in 1992 figures it was $42,000 an hour. Mr. President, that is for you and the entourage. How do you balance that off between important domestic travel and fundraising? I hope you are keeping an accurate record, or the taxpayers will be paying a phenomenal amount for our President to be out of the White House. 
President Clinton was out of town 149 days in 1997; 155 days through September of 1998. The President spent a total of 304 days outside of Washington in just the last 21 months. 
The reason I come to the floor this morning to talk about the President's travel schedule is to bring some substance to the seaminess of a comment a week ago that this is the do-nothing Congress. You might have grounds to make that kind of an argument if you had been sitting down at the White House with a phone in your hand working with us to try to resolve the budgets, to try to get out our appropriation bills, to try to do the business of this Government. But you have chosen not to do that. You have been out and about the country and the world at a record pace, and at the expense of the American taxpayer. 
I understand by news reports today the President is in town for the week: Mr. President, welcome back to Washington. I understand that you are going to be here for a week, hopefully to work with us in finalizing the work of Congress to get our budgets complete so we can leave town--most important, adjourn the Congress and go home as the American people would expect us to do and turn off the expense clock. 
I also think it is important, Mr. President, that you do, in fact, recognize that our country and our world is just in a little bit of an economic crisis and you are finally willing to cancel a few travel schedules and stay home to see if we can work out our problems. 
So, Mr. President, welcome home. I am going to be watching very closely and giving reports from time to time as the President spends the American public's tax dollars to travel around the country. Here is the travel log, and it is growing. Here are the charts, and they are growing. Call us a do-nothing Congress, Mr. President, and I will call you AWOL because you won't be here; you will be off flitting around the country, either fundraising or staying out of Washington because the heat is too hot in the kitchen. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, first of all, let me thank the Senator from South Dakota for those kind words. I enjoyed working with him on the meat labeling issue. While the legislation before the Senate advances it only slightly through a study as it relates to the country of origin, I do believe in this country the consumers have a right to know. I believe the consumers have a right to understand whether they are buying foreign or domestic beef. I think the livestock industry deserves, also, that opportunity. 
I thank my colleague from South Dakota for his leadership in the area. We will continue to work on this. This is an issue that will not go away. I certainly understand the difficulties of those in the retail industry. We can work those differences out. The compromise the Senator from South Dakota spoke to, that he and I worked on, moved a lot in that direction. I am sorry that they finally, in the end, felt they had to gang up on us a bit during the conference, but we will be back and the issue will be resolved. 
I must also tell you that I support a compromise in livestock reporting. I think there must be a transparency in that market for all the world to see. There isn't at this time. We are going to have to work to get to that. I am disappointed that the bill delays the implementation of a Federal milk marketing order reform that I supported. 
Now, while I have expressed my disappointment, I will stop with that because those are the areas that I had some concern about. Let me discuss the positive things that are in this very important bill. First, I thank the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee of the full Appropriations Committee, the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, for his leniency, his cooperation, his understanding, but most importantly, his dedication to the American farmer--whether in his State of Mississippi or whether in my State of Idaho--in ensuring that there is fair play in the balance of appropriating the Nation's resources, tax dollars, for the purpose of American agriculture. 
I do believe that this agriculture appropriations bill contains important funding for America's farm families. I am proud of it. I will vote for it. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same. It is an excellent effort on the part of the Senator from Mississippi. 
Compromise is what we work at. I am disappointed that the President, at the last moment, would send a signal of veto. 
I am amazed that this is a President who didn't say agriculture twice in his first campaign, but promised to say it three times in his second campaign. He never came with an agriculture policy, and now, in the last minute, after they discovered there was a farm crisis 3 months ago, he wants to veto an effort that has been underway for months to try to not only be sensitive to the issues that are down on the farm at this moment, causing great consternation, but would do so by saying, `let's veto.' 
The reason he says `let's veto' is because it is a habitual kind of thing for the President to want to fall backward into old policy that didn't work, that bound America's agricultural producers into a lockstep Government program offering no flexibility to the marketplace, but more importantly, having to ask the producer to turn to Government every year to decide what they were going to produce and what they were going to get in return. 
Now, that is not what the American farmer wanted, and even today, while those in production agriculture recognize the importance of some adjustment, some change in the current program, they are still saying leave the new farm bill program in place. Yet, this President is threatening a veto because we will not fall back to the policy of the old. 
What does the bill do that we are talking about here on the floor? Let me tell you what it does and let me tell you what it does for my State of Idaho. I will use it as an example. It funds research at America's colleges and universities in agriculture, at a time when agriculture and yields were dropping nationwide because we weren't investing in the future of American agriculture. 
Well, in my State of Idaho, the bill contains $500,000 for peas and lentils research; $500,000 for grass seed research; $500,000 for barley research; $550,000 for research on canola, a new and important crop in our area of Idaho; $1.7 million for research in small fruits; and $1.2 million for research in potatoes and potato disease, the blight that devastated production in the Idaho potato crops last year. Those are all part of a new research initiative the Senator from Mississippi worked to assure that we would get funded so we can invest in the productive future of American agriculture. It funds food stamps and other nutrition programs. 
Very little has been said about that today by those on the other side. Yet, that is critically important to America's poor and disadvantaged. It funds conservation and environmental programs, and some very good ones. It contains important biodiesel legislation, a new program for a very important part of a new and emerging market for production agriculture in the oilseed industry. It contains important sanction reform legislation and exempts agricultural products from sanctions on India and Pakistan. 
Why, then, if all of these good things are in there, do we have a President that threatens a veto? I have to believe it is because they didn't come with a policy; they don't have one today, and they have this habitual problem of wanting to fall back into the past. Freedom to Farm is everything about the future and very little about the past. That is where we ought to be. 
Now, there is a problem in weather-related disasters. There are certainly problems with world markets, as we increasingly tie production agriculture and its profitability to the world markets. Well over 40 percent of everything a farmer 
in America produces today has to sell in the world market, and we have to be sensitive to that. When those markets go south, prices go south. Does that mean the policy is bad, or does it mean we have a world economic problem? I think it is the latter. We recognize that and we have pumped billions of dollars into that. It won't go to the trader and it won't go to the exporter; it goes right to the bank account of the American farmer--$2.35 billion in disaster-related programs, weather-related programs. 
We turn to the Secretary of Agriculture and say: You have the tools, you implement it. We even gave him money to hire more staff to do so--$1.65 billion in income assistance directly to the farmer. This assistance will help provide America's farmers with economic stability that they need to talk to their banker this fall and to talk to their banker next spring, to get a line of credit to put the seed in the ground. And the cycle goes on. 
What does it mean in my State of Idaho? I will break it out for you. Today, the price of wheat at the Port of Lewiston, ID, is $2.75. So in the 1998 crop-year, if you add the transition payment of 65 cents, another transition of 45 cents, a loan deficiency payment of 55 cents, and the aid package I just talked about of $1.65 billion, that is 19 cents--that is $1.85 per bushel, Government assistance, to a $2.78 price at the Port of Lewiston today. That is $4.62 per bushel, and $4.62 is, under the current domestic and world market situation, a fair if not a good price in Idaho for wheat. 
Idaho wheat hit the bottom in early September when the price hit $2.26 at the Port of Lewiston--although the price was lower further inland in my State, which is more dependent upon rail traffic. Today, wheat is sold at $2.78; that is up 50 cents from its low. The market has assessed the production, and it is making its adjustments. We are helping stabilize that. That is probably why the bill that I am talking about, the current legislation, is supported by the National Farm Bureau and a majority of Idaho's farmers. Is it enough? Well, it is enough to get by on, especially when Government should not be the sole provider of the well-being of production agriculture. But it should understand when there is a crisis and respond to the crisis. That is what we are doing. That response is $1.84 a bushel in assistance. 
Now, some keep talking about the loan caps. We voted and voted, and we voted once again on that issue. A majority of Congress said leave the loan caps alone. I believe that the farmers don't want current policy changed. And while some would agree that the loan caps ought to be changed, when I talk to my farmers back home and we walk them through all that this appropriation bill offers, they say: That is fair, Senator. That is as much as we could expect you to do, and thank you for doing it. 
We have worked hard on this bill. The Senator from Kansas explained the coalition that came together before the July 4 break. We met with all of the commodity groups and asked, `What do you need?' They said, `Don't change the policy, but we have to have some transitional assistance.' Times are tough, and we understood that. Many of us went home in August and listened to our farmers and came back with the mind of putting a package like this together to offer assistance. 
The President wasn't listening then and he wasn't focused then. Mr. President, why did you quit your travels and come back this week and say you are going to veto the bill? I don't understand that. I don't understand why you have not been focused on this; yet, all of a sudden, it is time to veto it. You said, `I support Senator Harkin's programs'; yet, you offer a supplemental that is billions of dollars less. You have taken two positions on the issue and now you have a third. You say, `I will veto what you send me.' I don't understand that. I don't think America's farmers understand that very well. Government isn't the end-all to production agriculture. It should be of assistance when assistance is needed. It should care, and it should be concerned, and that is what this bill is reflective of this evening. We should knock down the political barriers and boundaries to enhanced trade. What has this administration done this year? They have not sold or given away one kernel of wheat in the name of humanity. Yet, they have hundreds of millions of dollars to buy wheat in the world and move it into the world hunger areas. Mr. President, why are you not doing that? Why do you come home from your world travels and political travels and say it is time to veto this effort? I don't understand that, Mr. President. I don't understand it. 
What we do understand, what Congress understands, and what this bill is reflective of is that you don't change policy; you work to adjust it. You make it fit the marketplace. When there is a national environmental or weather-directed disaster, when there is a downturn in world markets, you make adjustments, you care about production agriculture, and you darn well make sure the money gets home to the bank account of the farmer. 
That is what this appropriations bill offers. That is why the House voted on it 333 to 53. That is a big bipartisan vote for the House. Somehow there has to be some good in this legislation, if it drew that kind of a vote in the House. I hope it draws a bipartisan vote here when we vote on it. It deserves it, because it is reflective of the concerns of the current agricultural situation in our country, and, most importantly, it is reflective of the concern of production agriculture when production agriculture says don't change the policy over some transition, make sure that you are sensitive to what we are concerned about. 
But what is important to all of us is that we listen to production agriculture. And we know that there are times when a safety net is necessary. This year, as in past years, we have offered one of the largest safety nets in the history of our Government, and we will continue to do that. But let us not change the policy and drive our Government into the business of being the partner of production agriculture, drive it into the business of not ever determining the acreage that should be farmed, or the amount that should be farmed, but into the business of knocking down political barriers, into the business of working as a partner in selling in the world markets instead of simply sitting back with hands folded saying, `Oh, gee, we have an agriculture problem.' 
I think we ought to do something about it. We ought to control production. We ought to squeeze down on production in the rest of the nations of the world, save time to gear up and time to increase our acreage. If we are going to pull away, if the United States is going to pull away from its spot in the world market, we are going to fill it. That is what the policies of the past offered, and we had to fight for decades to gain them back. 
I hope that in the end, when the rhetoric cools, when the President develops an understanding of production agriculture--and I give him 24 hours to do it--that he will sign the bill, offer up the kind of assistance that this bill recognizes is important for our producers, and get on with the business of being a cooperating partner with production agriculture, and not a barrier, or not a hindrance, or not a Johnny-come-lately.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Grams, for dealing with an issue that this Senate has to deal with, and in a very short time. Somehow there is this belief here in Washington that you can save Social Security, but you can't give tax relief. Well, I, like Senator Grams, believe we must and can do both, not only to keep the economy moving and growing, but also to recognize the importance that we have a surplus, thanks to our diligence over the last decade, and now we can use it to strengthen and reform Social Security, and we probably have the opportunity of a generation to do that. I hope that the Congress can and will do both.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership that my friend and colleague, Senator Kempthorne, has shown on this legislation. He has raised a very important point here today. Anyone familiar with ranching in the West knows that an economically viable ranch requires access to large blocks of land to raise livestock in an environmentally sound way. With the intermingling of federal, state, and private lands in our state of Idaho, access to BLM land is essential for ranchers. Any time 12,000 acres are withdrawn from an existing BLM allotment, it will dramatically impact the rancher who holds the permit for that allotment. Blocked up land is more easily and economically managed. Scattered parcels have the opposite effect. There may come a time, as contemplated by the legislation, when the Air Force would relinquish its control over these lands. While Air Force relinquishment of the withdrawn lands may not occur for what would be considered a long time by most people, members of the ranching community measure such events by the passing of generations, and that end result can reasonably be anticipated. And so, I seek clarification for the inquiry initiated by my colleague from Idaho. The answer to his question will be vitally important to whoever holds the permit surrounding the withdrawn land at such time as the Air Force would, in fact, relinquish it to the Department of the Interior. I thank my colleague for yielding.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill, and I send it to the desk. 
Mr. President, the bill I introduce is the Hydroelectric Licensing Process Improvement Act of 1998. As its title suggests, the purpose of the bill is to improve the process by which hydroelectric projects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Under the existing law, non-federal dams that are constructed across navigable streams in the United States must be licensed by the FERC. In addition, under the present law, certain federal agencies, such as the United States Forest Service and the Departments of Commerce and Interior, have authority to mandate that FERC accept certain conditions in the license FERC ultimately issues. The Departments, for example, can impose conditions that address fish passage. The federal land agencies can impose conditions to protect federal land impacted by the project. FERC licenses, then, often contain conditions imposed by federal resource agencies. 
These agencies, however, through no fault of their own, are single issue agencies. The law limits their considerations to a narrow spectrum of concerns as they decide mandatory conditions. Experience shows by the use of this licensing process that these decisions that are made by these agencies are very narrow. You could say narrow minded. Why? Because they are single-issue agencies. And the law now dictates that they operate only in that realm in their decisionmaking. We do not have to settle for bad decisionmaking simply because oftentimes the information that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gets, or the information they are dictated to by these single-purpose agencies, would result in bad decisionmaking. By adjusting this law, we can, I believe, have a better decisionmaking process. I will say that this is clearly the intent of the legislation that I am introducing today. 
Now, Mr. President, these licenses for the dams can be for as little as 30 years and as much as 50 years. Decades ago, developers, both private ones such as investor owned utilities, and public ones such as municipal electric utilities or public utility districts, built hydroelectric projects and received original licenses for them from the FERC. Soon, many of those licenses will expire and the public and private license holders will seek new licenses from the FERC. Indeed, Mr. President, according to recent testimony of the National Hydropower Association before the House Energy and Power Subcommittee, over the next fifteen years, the FERC will consider for relicense, about two-thirds of existing non-federal hydroelectric projects. Nearly 300 projects, representing about 28,917 megawatts of power, will have their present, original licenses expire before the year 2012. 
Mr. President, many of those projects will involve the federal resource agencies. The FERC will consider major projects in western states like California, and eastern states like New York. It will consider significant projects in northern states like Michigan and southern states like Alabama. We all are, and we all will be affected by the process by which the FERC relicenses these dams. Mr. President, this bill is extremely important in light of the foregoing. 
Hydroelectric power is essential to the welfare of our country. It is clean, renewable and cheap. And, most importantly, it is very inexpensive compared with the other forms of energy. We need to take any steps necessary to ensure that this invaluable source of power remains available to the many consumers that depend upon it for their quality of life. Such steps include the process reforms contained in this bill. 
Such reform is necessary because the unfortunate point is, in the last decade the licensing process was created that we now have. What did it do? The process didn't help the energy peaking capability of many of these projects. 
According to a September 1997 study of the U.S. Department of Energy, since 1987, of 52 peaking projects relicensing by FERC, 4 projects increased capability, and 48 decreased capacity. In other words, they were less productive as a result of the licensing than they were prior to that relicensing. Ninety-two percent of the peaking projects since 1987 lost capacity. Hydropower is at risk, and it is important that our country understand that. 
This is not only unfortunate, but it is bizarre. It is bizarre, Mr. President, because we live in a time when we are rightly sensitive to the environment in which we live. It is difficult to find a source of electric power more benign to the atmosphere than falling water. Yet, this benign power source is at risk. The process reforms I propose will help reverse this trend. 
It is critical, Mr. President, that I note what the bill does not do. The bill does not--repeat, does not--eliminate the authority of federal resource agencies to mandate fish passages as conditions of a FERC license. Also, it does not--repeat, does not--eliminate the authority of federal land agencies to mandate FERC license conditions to protect federal lands impact by the hydroelectric project. That is what the bill will not do. It is important to understand that, because there are many groups that would think I would restrict the ability of some of these single-purpose agencies to participate in the relicensing process. Quite the opposite: I want to spread their authority in a way that makes it more responsible. 
This is what the bill will do. The bill will reform the licensing process and improve the decisionmaking in that process in several ways. 
1. It requires the federal resource agencies to consider a wider range of factors than they presently consider, as they decide what mandatory conditions to impose in a FERC license. It would require the agencies to examine factors such as: (a) economics; (b) air quality; (c) irrigation; (d) navigation; (e) flood control; (f) recreation; (g) generation capacity; and (h) drinking water supply. The present law does not obligate federal resource agencies to consider such factors. But, better decisions will result if they do. 
2. The bill requires those agencies to document their consideration of these factors. Agencies make better decisions in the light and not in the dark, Mr. President. 
3. The bill allows the license applicant to obtain expedited administrative review of the conditions proposed by the federal resource agencies for reasonableness. Some check, no matter how minuscule, on the agencies' decisions to impose mandatory conditions is needed. 
4. It requires the federal resource agencies to base their conditions on appropriate scientific review, which means a review based on empirical or field tested data, and subject to peer review. Good data helps lead to good decisions. 
Mr. President, who can quarrel with federal resource agencies basing their decisions on sound science? Who can quarrel with federal resource agencies broadening the factors they consider as they decide mandatory conditions? Who can quarrel with giving the license applicant, who must bear the burden of mandatory conditions a right to appeal administratively, on an expedited basis, proposed mandatory conditions of the federal resource agencies? Mr. President, these reforms will make for better decisionmaking by the federal resource agencies. 
The bill has another significant facet, Mr. President. It gives the FERC authority, after a license application is filed, and after, therefore, the federal resource agencies have documented their expanded and scientific review of conditions for the license, to require that the federal resource agencies submit those conditions to the FERC by a certain deadline. Simple, but it makes sense, because today those agencies don't have to comply with a deadline, but yet they have almost veto power by their absence from the process if they simply say they are considering a mandatory condition and are not yet willing to submit it to FERC for its inclusion in a license. 
In this way, FERC will have before it at one time these various conditions of resource agencies, and, therefore, FERC should be able to efficiently and expeditiously bring about a license. This gives the licensee the opportunity of a quickee appeal. This is what the legislation does. It does not take away the authority of the agencies, it expands it. But it shapes it. It brings about a process that is definable and predictable. And that is exactly what does not occur today. Licensing today can take 8, 15, or 20 years when it ought take no more than 3 or 4 or 5 years. It is not reasonable or right that it should take that long. 
Simply what we are doing is reshaping what was a very important piece of legislation now that we have some field experience with it. We cannot afford to lose clean, renewable, abundant resources like hydroelectricity. 
In my State of Idaho, we are proud of our hydro base. It brings about inexpensive energy to my State, and to the State of the Presiding Officer. The whole Pacific Northwest is proud that it based its future on the past insight of developing its hydroelectricity. We shouldn't be required to lose it because of misguided law. 
That is what I hope my legislation will do, if it becomes law. In the ensuing year, and in the new Congress, we will hold hearing across the West, and certainly here in Washington, on the validity of this approach, to shape the process that is currently underway into a time-predicatble process that all can understand and that all can deal with.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to share with the Senate a story about some fine young Idahoans who saved a family stranded in the wilderness. 
While hiking in the Idaho wilderness, Boy Scouts from Troops 44 and 74 saved a family of seven who had become lost, were severely dehydrated, and disoriented. With the skills that they developed through their Boy Scout training, they successfully guided the family to a point where they were met by rescue workers. In order to reach the family, the Scouts were forced to descend treacherous canyon walls, shale slides, boulder falls, and cliff areas. During the climb out of the canyon, the Scouts used ropes to physically support the exhausted family members. 
The performance of these fine young men goes far beyond commendable. Their flawless performance saved the lives of this family. In a day and age when we are bombarded by reports of how troubled and misguided today's youth are, it is truly refreshing to hear the story of these young men who have done something so outstanding. One can't help but respect their unselfish display of courage and resourcefulness. Perhaps their act, and the acts of other outstanding youths like them across the nation, will help us to restore our faith in them and in their future. It is my personal hope that by recognizing young men such as these, we can begin to refocus the lens through which we view society, in order to see, more clearly, the typical American youth--not as a delinquent or a burden, but a contributing member of society deserving our respect and our praise. 
It is my pleasure to recognize Kody Haney, Brian Wanstrom, Alan Wanstrom, Kyle Hestag, Eric Williams, Dustin Moss, Brandon Moss, Alex Davies, Darian King, Cayd Brunson, Dustin Hymas, Chris Mendenhal, and leaders Darrell Wheeler, Jeremiah Burnett, and Marie Burnett. On behalf of the State of Idaho and the United States Senate, allow me to thank you--for your courage, unselfishness, determination, and most important for being shining representatives of American youth.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an outstanding individual from the State of Idaho who is deserving of not only our praise, but our wholehearted respect. In the turmoil of daily life, it is easy to get so caught up in our own affairs that we forget those less fortunate around us. Cindy Georger is not one of those people. She has unselfishly dedicated her time and energy to one of the most important battles raging in our nation today--the fight against illiteracy. Although this struggle continues even during our high-tech entry into the 21st Century, small battles are being won every day by people like Cindy. 
Mrs. Georger, a Boise resident, has volunteered at `Learning Lab, Inc.' since 1994. This is a non-profit organization providing literacy programs in three sectors: Adult Basic Skills, English as a Second Language, and Family Literacy. She has assisted with children ages 3 to 5 who have at least one functionally illiterate parent. 
In volunteering with these children, Mrs. Georger is serving two equally important purposes. She is both tutoring children--undoubtedly one of the noblest of causes--and inspiring the parents of those children. By helping the parents, she is not only promoting literacy, but also family values, by encouraging them to take the time to sit down and read with their children. What a gift to give to a child--what a gift to give to a family. 
In a nation facing an unparalleled struggle to maintain family values, and plagued with reports of the American family as increasingly apathetic, it is easy to get disheartened, but through people like Cindy Georger it is possible to look to the future with hope--hope for a time when people care about others, when family returns to the top of everyone's agenda, and when every American knows how to read. 
I would like to thank Cindy Georger for her time, dedication, and efforts to promote and teach literacy. Her services, and the services of volunteers like Cindy throughout Idaho and the nation, are the instruments through which the battle of illiteracy can and will be won.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have requested to speak in morning business to talk about our President's policies, to talk about this administration and the policies that impact all Americans. 
As we know, the Senate has convened at a very interesting, unique, if not sad, day in the history of this Nation's Presidency. I will not dwell on that. It would be very inappropriate for me to do so. What I do want to talk about is an agenda that we have attempted to handle appropriately on the floor for the last several weeks; that is, to do the business of this Congress and to do the business of Government, to move the appropriations bills in an orderly fashion as our public and as the citizens of this Nation expect of us. 
For the last 2 weeks, we have attempted to deal with an appropriations bill appropriating money to the Interior Department and to its ancillary agencies, to in large part administer policy and manage the public land resources of this country. But anyone watching, and certainly the majority leader, who just left the floor, knows how frustrating it has been in an attempt to responsibly move this legislation, only to have our colleagues on the other side of the aisle largely oppose it. Oppose it because within the bill are corrective measures that reflect an attempt to adjust the misguided policies of this administration as it deals with our public land resources. 
We have made proposed changes. Why? Because the people of the public land West are saying, `No longer does this administration reflect our interests or our concerns or our economies.' 
Why am I speaking uniquely to the West? The appropriations bill largely deals with western public land and States' interests. But in my State of Idaho, where 63 percent of the land base is owned by and managed by the Federal Government, public land policy is critical, and mine is only a 63-percent ownership. In other States, like Nevada, it is much higher. So goes the Federal Government, so manages the land, so goes the economy and the lifestyles and the character of those States. 
I would like to spend the next few minutes discussing those policies and our concern about the attitude of this administration as it has impacted our policies. 
The provisions that I am talking about in the appropriations bill, if we can ever get back to it, are necessary, in my view, and appropriate, because many of us feel this administration has gone around Congress, the States and the local officials in an effort to place broad restrictions on the use of public lands for productive economic use, such as mining and forest products and grazing and even recreation. Recreation, a relatively benign use of the public land, is now being shaped, directed and oftentimes characterized by new policies of this administration. We believe strongly that the provisions that we have placed in the Interior appropriations bill are necessary, as I mentioned earlier, to block the administration's arrogant abuse of power and its failure to acknowledge that our States ought to have a say in the use of our natural resource bases. 
During the past 175 years, the United States has undergone an astonishing period of physical and economic growth. We acquired the Louisiana territory, bought Alaska from the Russians, and fought a war with Mexico over the Southwest and California. During that time, Americans moved westward, pursuing dreams of economic independence and the opportunity to raise their families in a new land. 
Our Government encouraged the westward movement of these hardy people by creating opportunity through the Homestead Act or the Timber and Stone Act or the mining law of 1872. 
These statutes, and others, were designed to encourage people to seek a new life, to build the wealth of a nation by developing its vast store of natural resources. And the effort was successful beyond any nation or any people's wildest dreams and imaginations. 
Thousands of American farmers and shopkeepers and clerks and grocers and professionals took up the challenge and moved West. They busted the sod of the central plains and established an agricultural wonder, the breadbasket of the world, never known before by man. They established enormous cattle and livestock operations from Texas to Kansas and Montana and throughout the Rocky Mountain States, including my State of Idaho. 
Thousands of prospectors fanned out across the West in search of gold, silver and other minerals. What these early miners found at Sutter's Mill in California or at Telluride in Colorado or at Silver City in Nevada or in the Boise Basin of Idaho, and hundreds of other boomtowns across the West, galvanized the Nation. 
Thousands more ordinary Americans got caught up in the gold rush, too. Most were not successful in finding their bonanza. Instead, they formed the backbone of the new West because they brought other skills and talents with them. These are the people who built the great cities of Denver, Salt Lake City, Boise, Helena, Houston and San Francisco. They became the merchants, the bankers, the doctors, and the educators who helped ensure the success of the intermountain and the coastal west. 
These Americans built the great transcontinental railroad to bring additional settlers into the growing cities and towns and to move the exploding basket of western-produced goods to the markets of the East. 
Throughout the balance of the 19th century, as well as the 20th century, both Federal and private lands in the West contributed mightily to the economic success of our great Nation. In addition to gold and silver, deposits of lead, nickel, molybdenum, iron, and other minerals were discovered and developed. 
In the 1920s and 1930s, oil and natural gas deposits were found in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Utah and New Mexico. And, of course, the forest products and the livestock industries continued to grow and to prosper providing building materials and food for our growing Nation. 
These achievements were not realized by the U.S. Government but by the women and the men who accepted the challenge who had the vision and who had the courage. They took enormous risks. And with their lives and with their fortunes they built new businesses, opened mines, started ranches and farms, and began new lives and created a new culture, a tradition, a western culture tradition, based on wise and sustainable use of the land and its resources. 
Mr. President, I can talk about this firsthand. My own family is a part of that tradition of independence and determination. One hundred years ago next year, my grandfather set foot in Idaho and took advantage of the Homestead Act and began to build a ranching operation that flourished and raised a family with that ranching operation to be passed on to a future generation. 
The western tradition recognized the value of land and its resources and the need to husband those resources carefully and 
sustainably. No one can honestly believe that we who live on and depend on these precious lands would seek to strip them of all of their values and deny their use and their beauty to the rest of Americans. You see, my granddad taught my father that tradition; and my father taught me that the land was a sacred resource that should be managed wisely. 
Indeed, with forest products, mining, oil and gas production, and other forms of resource-intensive multiple uses in place, recreational opportunities began to flourish, began to increase. More and more Americans are coming to enjoy the natural beauty and the resources of the intermountain West. They come to enjoy our hunting and our fishing, our sightseeing, our camping, our mountain climbing, and to just be plain quiet; in other words, to search for and find solitude. 
These opportunities were once available only to those of us who lived in these great States of the West--the Idahos and the Wyomings and the Montanas and other Rocky Mountain and Pacific States--or to the wealthy who could afford the time and expense associated with recreational journeys to our States. 
Now our recreational-based economies have grown greatly and are supplementing our traditional economies devoted to forest products harvest, mining and agriculture. In fact, last year about 8.1 million visitors came to my State of Idaho alone. That is more than six times my State's population of 1.2 million. 
Federal law acknowledges and encourages the diverse activities that take place on the lands about which I have talked. It has formalized the concept in a policy called multiple-use which was defined in the Multiple-Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960 to mean managing the natural resources in our public forests for the combination of uses that best meet the needs of the American people. It has long been recognized that multiple-use policy is in the best public interest because it enables the resources to continue to produce benefits while conserving the value of that resource. 
Mr. President, while all of this suggests the western public land States are enjoying a life of beauty and economic success, I want to let my colleagues and the rest of America know that we in the West are facing a terrific threat. Unfortunately, that threat is our own Federal Government and the policies of this administration. 
When the current administration took office, the Federal agencies responsible for managing Federal lands began an all-out assault on the concept of multiple-use in favor of preservation and limited use. They have relentlessly pursued a philosophy of returning these lands to something they call `presettlement conditions.' 
They have shut out local governments from land use planning decisions. They have reduced Federal land managers to messengers delivering land use policy decisions from Washington, DC, down to the local level, as if Federal authorities here know best how to manage specific tracts of Federal forest or other Federal land units. 
This arrogant behavior is not occurring just in Idaho but it is represented and reflected across the public land States of the West. The Forest Service is proposing to limit boating experiences on the Snake River in Idaho. The Service is trying to remove from use thousands of acres of grazing land in Arizona and New Mexico through a concept and a contract with environmental groups, ignoring current permittees and State governments and the historic laws and policies formulated and passed by Congresses and by this Congress. 
Also, having been denied the opportunity to shut down the mining industry by Congress' refusal to accept punitive changes in the mining law of 1872, Secretary Babbitt has stopped new mining activities on public lands by slowing the permit process to a crawl. And when he must operate within the context of the current law, he hops on a soapbox on Wall Street and demagogues the very action that the laws require him to take. As a result, no new jobs are being created and no new revenues are coming to either the States or the Federal Treasury. 
Mr. President, some Federal use managers and national environmental groups also have stymied local efforts to resolve disputes over how to manage Federal lands. A group called the Quincy Library Group, encompassing forest product company employees and local authorities and environmentalists, developed a plan to protect roadless areas and old growth areas in the Plumas and Lassen National Forests in northern California while still allowing selective cutting on about 240 million board feet of forest products. 
The Forest Service dragged its feet, would have nothing to do with the concept or the idea. It had to be changed here by the legislative effort. And let me tell you how popular it was. 
It passed the House by a 429-1 vote. It is pending here in the Senate. The administration was dragged into it kicking and screaming because the public outcry for the support of this balanced policy was so great. 
Mr. President, another example of the arrogance of this administration's approach to land use policy is its decision to declare by proclamation a new unit in the protection category of Federal lands, the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. If you haven't heard about this, you haven't been listening to the cries coming from the West. The President unilaterally took 1.7 million acres of Federal and State land and included these acres in a new monument without consulting any of Utah's elected officials--not one, not Senator Bennett nor Senator Hatch nor Utah's three Members in the House, not Utah's Governor. In fact, no one--well, except a few local environmental groups--knew of the President's plan, the plan that we only heard about when he stood on the banks of the Grand Canyon to proclaim it on the eve of his last election. 
Now, as chairman of a Public Lands Subcommittee here in the Senate, I held hearings on a Utah wilderness bill. The State of Utah had worked to incorporate all interests, from the grassroots to the very highest levels of their Federal delegation, to try to preserve this area. They had been working on the way that public policy should appropriately be formed. Yet the President, with the sweep of a pen and the denial of local input, decided that he alone would lock up this land. 
At a hearing on May 1, 1997, on legislation introduced to make sure that the President keeps his promise he made to Senator Bennett, Louise Liston of Garfield County, UT, the local community elected commissioner said:  
We feel that the creation of this monument was deliberately fabricated behind closed doors without consulting or notifying any member of the Utah congressional delegation, the Governor, or any local official. I have no doubt that history will single it out as the best or perhaps I would say the worst example of the entire Clinton Presidency of irresponsible and indefensible policy making in the natural resource area. I certainly would hope that we do not see anything worse in the next 4 years. 
I could go on and on with examples, and there are many. However, several of our colleagues have now joined me. I know they have other topics to visit that demonstrate the misguided positions of this administration. 
Mr. President, I turn to Senator Sessions.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to tell Senator Sessions how well he serves the taxpayers of our country and this Congress for bringing these issues to the floor. We do not, at a time of fiscal austerity and attempting to balance the budget and stabilize Social Security and strengthen it for the future and give some tax cuts, need to be committing ourselves to the building of palaces. I appreciate him bringing that issue to the floor, again, in the theme that there are other practices of this administration that deserve to be brought to the forefront for the American people to understand. 
Let me turn to the Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank the Senator from New Jersey for authoring and bringing forth Senate Resolution 279. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of it, along with the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski; for he and I have, can I say, labored mightily, along with the Senator from Florida, over the last good many months, first of all, to work on the issue of self-determination for Puerto Rico. 
I certainly thank all of my colleagues for the cosponsorship of S. 472, legislation that I introduced a year ago that I hoped, as does the Senator from Florida, that we could be voting on at this time--debating it, voting on it, and giving our Puerto Rican friends and fellow citizens the opportunity, a clear direction as it relates to self-determination. That is not going to be the case. Time has not allowed that. 
So I hope that by next year the record before the Senate might include the results of another plebiscite in Puerto Rico that the Senator from Florida has just mentioned. That is why the resolution before us today, I think, is very important. 
In accordance with their rights of self-determination, the citizens of this Nation--the people of Puerto Rico--acting through their constitutional process and elected representatives, have empowered themselves to conduct a vote based on the record created in the House and the Senate deliberations in the Congress since the 1993 vote. 
Since any act of self-determination in Puerto Rico is not self-executing, the resolution of Puerto Rico's political status is a Federal matter that can only be fully and finally determined by an act of Congress. However, in the exercising of its powers in this regard, Congress must be informed by the freely expressed wishes of the citizens of Puerto Rico. Thus, this resolution recognizes that the coming vote will advance the process of self-determination within the framework of our great Nation's Constitution. 
Contrary to rumors in Puerto Rico, there was no great intrigue or political reaction to videotapes from the local status campaigns that prevented the Senate from moving forward with legislation at this time. Rather, faced with what we all understand is a very complicated schedule here in the final days before we adjourn, and concern on the part of colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we have brought Senate Resolution 279 to the floor to express at this time, as the House has expressed, an opportunity for the Puerto Ricans to advance the cause of their self-determination. And I hope that the resolution and our vote on it tonight reflects that. 
Mr. President, today the Senate ends its prolonged silence on the question of Puerto Rico's political status. The 105th Congress will not end without a Senate response to the 1994 and 1997 petitions of the Legislature of Puerto Rico to Congress. By our action today, the Senate joins the House in responding to those petitions by recognizing the need for further self-determination in Puerto Rico. This is because the 1993 status vote in Puerto Rico did not resolve the status question. Indeed, no option won a majority in 1993. 
That is why I sponsored a bill to recognize the need for further self-determination. I thank my colleagues from both parties who joined me by cosponsoring S. 472. 
I also want to thank the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski, for his assistance and leadership to establish a record to support action by the committee and the full Senate on this matter. I regret that the draft chairman's mark has not been acted on, but I applaud his commitment to move the self determination issue forward. 
It now appears that by next year the record before the Senate may include the results of another plebiscite in Puerto Rico. That is why the resolution before us today is so very important. In accordance with their right of self-determination, the people of Puerto Rico, acting through their constitutional process and elected representatives, have empowered themselves to conduct a vote based on the record created in the House and Senate deliberations in Congress since the 1993 vote. 
Since any act of self-determination in Puerto Rico is not self-executing, resolution of Puerto Rico's political status is a federal matter that can only be fully and finally determined by an act of Congress. However, in exercising its powers in this regard Congress must be informed by the freely expressed wishes of the residents of Puerto Rico. Thus, this resolution recognizes that the coming vote will advance the process of self-determination within the framework of our great Nation's Constitution. 
Contrary to rumors in Puerto Rico, there was no great intrigue or political reaction to videotapes from the local status campaigns that prevented the Senate from moving forward with legislation at this time. Rather, faced with the difficulty of completing a full Senate debate on the draft chairman's legislative mark, this body is doing the right thing by moving forward with a Resolution recognizing the need for further self-determination and recognizing the constraints placed upon it. 
I am proud of the Senate today, and I am proud of the people of Puerto Rico for seizing the moment and organizing an act of self-determination that is based upon the arguments heard in the Congressional process which will continue next year. This action is good for Puerto Rico and serves the interests of our entire Nation as we move forward together to seek to resolve the territorial status dilemma that began 100 years ago. I wish our fellow U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico well in exercising their God given right of self-determination. I hope they will join me in trusting that their voice will be heard and that Congress will answer. In America, we have no alternative to democracy and desire nothing more. 
I join with my colleagues from Florida, New Jersey--now the chairman of the full committee is here on the floor--to say to our friends and citizens of Puerto Rico that we ask them to go forward with their vote in December. We hope that that is an advanced expression of their desire to advance the cause of statehood, but most importantly to advance the cause of self-determination so that the Congress can have the kind of direction that we hope that vote will bring. 
With that, I yield the floor.  
Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, first of all, for the leadership role he has taken over the last good number of years to try to bring reform to the 1872 mining laws. 
For some reason, the Senator from Arkansas would like to portray that mining is a rogue industry in our Nation that goes unregulated, outside environmental regulations, and he cited today 5-acre mine sites. They are not outside the environment, they are simply outside a plan of operation. My guess is, one could find piles of chicken manure in that State that violate environmental laws that are less than 5 acres that are not controlled. Does that sound silly and facetious on my part? Yes, it does, and I apologize to the Senator from Arkansas for saying it, but I want him to understand that when he makes a statement like `5 acres, rogue, out of control,' it is not true. It is not true in my State that has very tight environmental laws, and it is not true in other mining States. 
What the Senator from Arkansas would like to have you believe in his compassionate statements about mining is that somehow these impact his State. His State is not a mining State, per se. Mine is. The Senator from Alaska has a mining State. The Senators from Nevada have a mining State. Those States have had mining for over 100 years, and some of that mining they are not proud of, or I should say, were not proud of. 
In the sixties and the seventies and the eighties and the nineties, those States began to take control of their own environmental destiny, in part urged by the Senator from Arkansas, no question about it; in part, a product of the National Environmental Policy Act; in part a product of the Clean Air Act; in part a product of the Clean Water Act. All of those came together to shape plans of operation and new mining strategies for this country. I will tell you what it did in my State. It cleaned up a lot of messes, messes by the definition of today's environmental standards and ethics, not definitions by mining and environmental standards of 70 or 80 years ago. 
Why is the Senator standing up here this morning painting the world as if it were black, most importantly, painting the world of mining as if it were a disaster? The Senator from Arkansas knows it just `ain't' so, but this is one of his causes celebres which you and I have heard on this floor--and I serve with him on the committee--for a long, long while. 
What is the essence of this administration's attempt to rewrite the 3809 regulations? My guess is that Secretary Babbitt and Solicitor Leshy are creating a solution for a problem that doesn't exist, or more importantly, creating a solution that plays to their political base and hoping there is a problem out there to which they can attach it. I have a feeling that down underneath all of this, this is just about the whole of the problem that we are attempting to debate on the floor today. 
There is no question that this Senator, the Senator from Alaska and a good many other Senators want responsible mining law and we think, in large part, we have it, because the old 1872 mining law in one court case after another, after another, after another, after another, after another, piled up over 100-plus years, has transformed the world of mining in this country into not only the significant industry it is, but the environmental-sensitive industry that it is today. 
Yet, the Senator from Arkansas and others love to drag out 20-year-old pictures and 20-year-old stories as if they had just happened yesterday and say, `Oh, look at these pictures and read this story; isn't it terrible what the world of mining is doing to the clear and pristine lakes and rivers of our country?' 
Let me tell you the mining story, the pictures and the story today about those clear and pristine rivers. They were not once clear and pristine. Mining tailings were dumped into them, and the rivers in my State, in one instance, ran murky the year round. But today the Coeur d'Alene River, flowing down through the major mining district of my State, runs clean. Fish propagate in it. Kids swim in it. 
That wasn't true 20 years ago. It was a combination of Federal and State effort that produced that. But most importantly, it was the ethics of the citizens and the government of the State of Idaho that said as a mining State, we have to do it right, and that is what Western Governors are saying today to this administration and to the Senator from Arkansas and to a lot of others who like to use this as their political base. 
Look at the politics of it, sure, but look at the reality of what we are doing. All of these States have very tight laws and regulations today. You heard it from the Senators from Nevada, one of the top mining States in the Nation today, employing tens of thousands of people and bringing hundreds of millions of dollars into our economy. They are doing it right. They are doing it under all of those environmental laws that were passed on this floor in the sixties and the seventies and the eighties, and they are not backing away from them or trying to shrink from those laws. They are trying to improve them and better them. 
So why is the Secretary of Interior and his Solicitor and the Senator from Arkansas looking for a solution to fit a problem that doesn't exist? I am not sure. I already suggested it does identify with their political base, but I am not so sure it identifies with the real world, especially if a former Governor, who talks about how his State has done so well, believes that States ought to have powers and rights in these areas. 
He and I have worked very closely together over the last several years to reform the 1872 mining law and to attempt to empower those States in cooperation with the Federal Government to assure that that relationship and those kind of dynamics continue. On that I don't disagree with the Senator from Arkansas, but I do disagree with the Federal Government and its heavy hand ignoring the States' Governors until we shove them into beginning dialog with them on the reform of these rules. 
Most of the Western Governors, however, who have problems, who are working well with respect to mining operations within their boundaries, want the BLM to do a couple of things with any modification in regulation; and yet most Governors say they have not been worked with well, they have not been listened to, and if you do not do major things, that it will not happen. 
Again, the heavy arm of the Federal Government will come down against States. Once again, we violate or at least we ignore the Constitution of our country, all in the name of a current political cause that does not seem to exist much more today because we addressed it a long time ago. That is the essence of the amendment to the Interior appropriations bill by the Senator from Arkansas. 
What did we do this year? Because of the difference between the Department of Interior and the Governors--the Western States Governors primarily--we have said, `Let's get the National Academy of Sciences, an impartial group, to step in between and examine this solution looking for a problem.' 
They are impartial. Both sides, I think, would respect their integrity. And let us see how much of a problem there is out there. Let us scope the magnitude of it before we bring down the heavy hand of Government and put thousands of people out of work or risk putting thousands of people out of work and destroying some significant economies in many of our Western States. 
That is really the essence of what we do here today. It isn't that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has not been diligent. The Senator from Arkansas has been diligent. We just cannot agree. We have fundamental disagreements. I want mining. I want it alive and well and creating jobs in my State--minerals and metals for the economy. And I am not so sure that that is what he wants. Or at least he wants it in a way that largely causes the investors in my State to go offshore to make those investments--under the same environmental standards that they would make in this country except they avoid the burdensome multiyear regulatory process of a Government that really does not care about the economies of investment and jobs because the cause they lift themselves to is a cause higher. 
That is the issue of this amendment. When you have a dispute between two concerned parties--and we do here; the Senator from Arkansas and I and others just fundamentally disagree--what is wrong with bringing an impartial body in between us to examine the problem that by my estimation does not exist and by the estimation of the Senator from Arkansas does exist? 
What is wrong with bringing an impartial body to the fore for that purpose? That is exactly what the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee thought ought to be done, in consultation with the chairman of the full authorizing committee, the Senator from Alaska. That is what we are doing. And that is why the Senator from Arkansas is trying to stop it, because it might bring about a solution that works. And it would deny this administration the right to slash and burn and destroy a mining industry that they did not like out there on the public lands to begin with. 
Secretary Babbitt has not been bashful. Every time he has to comply with the law, he gets on a soap box and degrades it and says that he is being forced to do certain things. Well, it is terrible when you are forced to abide by the law. Why should you shun it? But then again, I, as chairman of a subcommittee, the Senator of a full committee, and the Senator from Arkansas have invited Secretary Babbitt to the table for the last 6 years to work out these problems. And their answer is, `No. It's to our advantage to have the politics of it, not the solution to it.' 
That is the essence of the debate here on the floor. It really is, in my opinion, that clear and that simple. You cannot talk about modern mining today and use 20-year-old examples, because most of those were created 20 years before they became a problem. Yet, that is the basis of the argument. That is the strength of any argument that they attempt to produce. 
So I hope that my colleagues will stand with us today in opposing the Bumpers amendment--that we should table that amendment--because while it can be partisan at times, this is not a partisan issue. The Senators from Nevada are Democrats, and I am a Republican, and we are from neighboring States. 
Mining has been for 100 years a major part of our economy and yet today remains an important part of our economy. My State is touted as being one of the most beautiful, mountainous, high-desert States in the Nation, with clear flowing streams, pristine mountain meadows. And 100 years of a mining legacy? Yes. It seems like Idahoans did it right. Then while they were doing it right, they learned to do it better. And there is no question that the environmental laws we passed here in the 1960s and the 1970s and the 1980s helped them do it better. 
But just a few years ago our reclamation laws, our mining laws as a State, were the example for the rest of the Western States to follow, and many of them did. Many of my miners have received national environmental awards for their productions, for their operations, for their facilities, and they are very, very proud of it. 
So what is the advantage of standing here on the floor today and pounding the podium and talking about the evil mining industry and the environmental problems it creates? Well, if you are an echo of the past, maybe there is value there. Or if you are the politics of yesterday, maybe there is value there. But if you really want to work with our Western Governors, and solve a problem, and bring two divided sides together, then you do exactly what this bill does--you employ a neutral party, the National Academy of Sciences, to analyze at least the proposed problem that Messrs. Leshy and Babbitt suggest exists, and examine the solution that they have out there, searching for and coming up with a resolution. 
I am quite confident that if the National Academy of Sciences proposes, that we will take a very, very serious look at disposing with that. That is the issue here. Let us proceed in that manner. Let us not divide the Federal Government and State governments any more. Let us build a working partnership, as we have had in the past, that will project us, I think, into a productive future so that mining can remain a strong part of our economy, as it should, and, in my opinion, as it must if we are going to continue to have a free flow, an important flow, of minerals and metals to the critical economies of this country. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, is there a farm problem? You bet there is. Is there a farm crisis? Yes. On most farms in America today, if you are below the cost of production, and you have a debt, you have a problem. The Senators on the other side of the aisle are absolutely true to what they speak. And I could have used every one of their charts this afternoon for the very same message. 
We have a crisis in American agriculture. Is it a result of Freedom to Farm? No. It is a combination of everything coming together, the loss of our markets in Asian countries and tremendous overproduction. Thank goodness, it is a blessing in most countries when agriculture overproduces; it is a crisis in ours because it shoves down the price of commodities. 
Yes, Mr. President, we have a crisis in farm country. Have we recognized it? Yes, we have. And we started doing something about it before we adjourned here in August. We passed and reauthorized the agriculture research title. We advanced the fiscal year 1999 transition payment. We revoked sanctions on India and Pakistan to try to move some of our product into the market. 
We approved significant reform in the farm labor program. We established a binational commission to examine the concern that we have with beef prices and with the flood of Canadian meat coming into our market. We required international programs to purchase American commodities. And we passed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution encouraging USDA to use existing authorities to help wheat farmers. Did it raise the price of wheat at the farm bin? It did not. But it sets in motion a variety of opportunities to begin to move that. 
What further should we do? Frankly, Mr. President, there is a great deal more we should do. The chairman of the Ag Committee has announced he will reexamine much more thoroughly sanctions and trade reform to open up the 11 percent of the market that our farmers are now exempt from or cannot get to. We have talked about and we will do meaningful tax reform. 
Our colleague from Kansas has talked about making sure that crop insurance is the right kind of insurance so that the production agriculture buys it and uses it to insure their crops, to insure their income against disaster, against drought for an income purpose. We are working on that. We have to get that done next Congress, come heck or high water. 
And then let us look at a lost market compensation payment. The Senator from Iowa says that is so much money, just throw it out to the farmer. It is something we can buy and afford to buy. It is not a $7 billion program off-budget, no offsets--emergency spending proposed by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
Senators, this is a $7 billion program you are being asked to vote on tonight. Stop and think about it. We have not worked together. When we solve agricultural problems, we come together. All of those items that I mentioned we passed before the August recess, we did it in a bipartisan way. We did not open the farm bill. We did not open Freedom to Farm. 
I would hope you stand behind the chairman of the Senate Ag Committee tonight on a motion to table. Does that mean this issue is gone? Absolutely not. We are meeting now and we will meet tomorrow. I would hope, too, that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would come down and sit with us and look at what we can do. Are we going to spend some money? Yes. We are going to spend some money so that agriculture does not go bankrupt. And we have got to do it. But I suggest that lifting a loan cap does not solve that problem on the short-term basis and the long-term basis. Then it becomes so easy to extend it, and then it is $8 or $10 billion or more. 
So this is not the last vote we are going to have tonight or tomorrow or before this Congress adjourns to deal with a real farm crisis, be you a grain producer, a hog farmer, a cattle rancher--soybeans, corn, you name it. They are not making money. They are losing millions. 
We ought to be sensitive to assuring that there is some kind of baseline out there this year so that the farmer can be in production next year. We will accomplish that here in the Senate, if we recognize that and come together to get it done. 
I do not believe this is a solution to the problem. I encourage all of our colleagues to stand with the chairman of the Ag Committee--vote to table this amendment.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. 
Sometimes the wrong debate happens at the wrong time, and the debate that we have heard on this floor for the last several days, in my opinion, is the wrong debate for a lot of reasons. We shouldn't be talking about changing laws, but enforcing the very laws we have. 
I think all of us watched as the Congress decided to change campaign laws a good number of years ago to make them much tougher and tighter, to create reporting thresholds, and to make sure that the public was well aware what went on in the campaign business of our country and in the fundraising business of our country. 
Several of our colleagues have already spoken today about the ongoing investigations into campaign finance abuses. Those abuses didn't happen because the laws were inadequate. It doesn't mean that you are going to get character change all of a sudden because of a myriad of new laws that this Congress might pass. 
Now the spin machines are using the issue of campaign finance reform to suggest that the entire system is crooked and corrupt. Mr. President, and American citizens, that just `ain't' so. There are some people in the system who have chosen to corrupt it, but the campaign system we have today is alive and well, as it should be. Most of us play by the rules, and the rules are tough, and they are exacting. The reason they ought to be is to assure the right of all political candidates to speak out and to make sure that the American public can have, as they should have, the proper access to the political process. 
The votes that are going to occur on this floor in the next few moments are absolutely critical. I am frustrated by many of my colleagues who stand up and suggest that the political system that we have today is a corrupt system. It has been corrupted by some, and those who are corrupting it are under investigation today. But clearly it is a system that works--it works very well--reporting to the public, as we should, what is the right and responsible thing to do, particularly at a time in our history when confidence has been shaken in some of our institutions. 
It is absolutely imperative that we do not put new 
restrictions into the ability of the politician, the public person, to communicate with his or her constituents in an open and frank manner. Existing law allows that. I don't think we need to be tampering with our first amendment or suggesting in some way that we can make it a lot better. We just simply need those few who corrupt the system to abide by the laws as they are currently written and currently administered. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as America celebrated the Labor Day holiday this past weekend, it seems appropriate to take a moment to highlight the recent efforts to renew the partnership between the National Guard and Reserve forces and their community employers. Now, more than in any recent decade, the Guard and Reserve are key to maintaining our military commitments. More than a quarter million members served in Operation Desert Storm, and more than 17,000 have been called to active duty to support operations in Bosnia. 
The partnership between all employers, whether in the private or government sector, and the Reserve forces must extend beyond the 1994 Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Communications and cooperation between employers and their employees who participate in the National Guard and Reserve must be maintained to support our military structure. Without employers' full support, it becomes much more difficult to maintain our military strength. 
In Idaho, we have more than 5,400 Guard and Reservists. These men and women not only serve to support our national security, but also carry out a wide range of domestic missions. Last year, Idaho lost two Reservists who were responding to flooding emergencies. We do not forget that they paid the ultimate price to protect our community during disaster. Although we may never be able to thank our Guard and Reserve forces enough for their efforts and commitment, we can ensure that they have flexibility to serve in their units and secure employment upon their return. This renewed partnership between employers and our Guard and Reserve will do just that. 
Labor Day is not just Labor's Day. It is a celebration of an all-American accomplishment and an all-American ethic. Here, the dignity of labor is not a matter of partisan politics, but civic pride. Public recognition of the partnership between individuals who serve their country and communities, and the employers who support them, is a true way to celebrate this Labor Day holiday.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I had the privilege of working with Senator Conrad on crafting the indemnity payment. We cooperated with Senator Cochran in getting it in the agriculture bill. We are going to go to conference right soon. We think that will be in the new fiscal year. You talk about immediacy of payment? We hope that will be available by late this year to deal with some of these agricultural problems. 
But I must say, it has not been shaped to my satisfaction. Senator Conrad and I have talked about how we would work within the conference to make sure that it is a legitimate approach toward a true disaster environment. This is a broader approach that deals with more farmers. 
The definition under which Senator Conrad and I shaped that--he being the primary author--dealt with double, back-to-back disasters. It is narrower by scope. We may want to adjust that some. I would not think tonight we would want to just accept it as it was originally crafted with its narrowness. The problem is already much larger today than when we passed it, by character of the drought and heat in Texas and in other States. It is already broader. We will want to look at that again. 
It is not that I am objecting. I am saying I think we will be working together in the conference of the Ag approps to make that a viable approach as we originally thought it ought to be.

Mr. CRAIG. There is no question it does. Is it something new? No. Is it advanced? You bet it is. When the crops dried out in the field and the banker wants you to pay your bills and you can pay them sooner than later, then it is a big help. This is not opening up Freedom to Farm. This is advancing a payment that is already built within that structure. That is why there is the budget impact about which the majority leader spoke. 
I hope we can work together to resolve this, as we thought we had, so that this can move forward this week to deal with the problems that are very current in our agricultural sector.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I, too, have come to the floor this morning to thank you, and certainly the Senator from Iowa, the Senator from Wyoming, who has been involved with us, along with our leader, Trent Lott, Senator Burns of Montana, Senator Roberts, and myself in looking at the current agricultural situation in this country, which is very concerning to all of us as commodity prices plummet in the face of what could be record harvests and as foreign markets diminish because of the Asian crisis and world competition. 
As a result of that, we have come together to look at tools that we could bring to American agriculture, production agriculture, farmers and ranchers, that would assist them now and into the future to build stability there and allow them not only to invest but to save during years of profit in a way that is unique for American agricultural. 
In 1986, when this Congress made sweeping tax reform, they eliminated income averaging. I was in the House at that time and I opposed that legislation. I remember an economist from the University of Virginia saying that it would take a decade or more, but there would come a time when all of us in Congress would begin to see the problems that a denial of income averaging would do to production agriculture; that slowly but surely the ability to divert income during cyclical market patterns would, in effect, weaken production agriculture at the farm and ranch level to a point that they could not sustain themselves during these cyclical patterns. Bankruptcies would occur; family operations that had been in business for two or three generations would begin to fail. 
We are at that point. We have been at that point for several years. I remember the words of that economist in a hearing before one of the House committees echoing, saying, `Don't do this. This is the wrong approach.' In those days, though, I wasn't, but others in Congress were anxious to crank up the money and spend it here in Washington and return it in farm products, recycle it, skim off the 15 or 20 percent that it oftentimes takes to run a government operation, and then somehow appear to be magnanimous by returning it in some form of farm program. 
That day is over. We ought to be looking at the tools that we can offer production agriculture of the kind that is now before the Senate in the legislation that we call the Family Investment and Rural Savings Act, not only looking at a permanency income averaging, but looking at real estate depreciation, recapturing, and a variety of tools that we think will be extremely valuable to production agriculture at a time when they are in very real need. 
Also, the transition payments' extension that we have talked about moving forward to give some immediate cash to production agriculture, that is appropriate under the Freedom to Farm transitions in which we are currently involved, becomes increasingly valuable. 
I join today and applaud those who have worked on this issue, to bring it immediately, and I hope that we clearly can move it in this Congress, to give farmers and ranchers today those tools--be it drought or be it a very wet year or be it the collapse of foreign markets. Prices in some of our commodity areas today are at a 20-plus year low, yet, of course, the tractor and the combine purchased is at an all-time high. 
I do applaud those who have worked with us in bringing this legislation to the floor, and I thank the chairman for the time. 
I yield the floor.

I can understand a rush to immediacy. That is in the next fiscal cycle. I think it is important we deal with it in a fair and balanced way. As it is written, already the circumstances of agriculture have changed significantly enough. We deserve to look at it in a broader spectrum. 
We, the Senate, tonight acted to bring some immediacy to the difficulty you are expressing. There may be more to be done in the coming weeks as this whole difficulty with production agriculture increases across our country.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join with my colleagues from Missouri and Kansas in their amendment to eliminate the marriage penalty. There has been a growing level of frustration amongst most of us in the Senate and, I am sure, our colleagues on the other side of the Rotunda, as the Congressional Budget Office and others predict and justify by their analysis higher and higher budget surpluses, as to what we will do with this revenue. As most of my colleagues know, I, amongst others, have fought for decades to bring about a balanced budget knowing that from that budget we would have opportunities to significantly change the way our Government does business, but most importantly, the way our Government impacts the lives of American citizens in the form of rules and regulations and laws, because balanced budgets limit Government, but most importantly, as a result of the kind of impact the Federal Government, through its taxing policies, have on wage earners' ability to earn and to spend their money for themselves, for their families, for their children. 
Over the course of creating tax policy the last good number of decades, one of the great tragedies that I think the public recognizes is that Congress can use tax policy as a form of social engineering. You can cause the public to move their moneys in one direction or another by the way you tax them. You can also cause the public or individuals to act differently. 
There was a recent article in a newspaper, a national wire story just this past week. More couples are living together without being married than ever in the history of our country. They cited a lot of reasons. One of the reasons they didn't cite was tax policy. But in talking with citizens of my State and couples who have chosen to live together without marriage, the marriage penalty is clearly one of those issues. 
Tragically enough, that is either by intent or by mistake, but the reality is clear: Tax policy driven by this Congress and by the American Government has caused a lifestyle change in our country, a change in the forming of the family unit that many of my colleagues today have said, and rightfully spoken to, as being the foundation of our society, the strength of our communities and, therefore, the strength of our country. 
Tax policy should not do that, and here we are in an opportune time, an opportunity that we have never had in the years I have spent here, to make these kinds of changes, and we ought to do it. 
I must also tell you that with the projected surplus over the next 5 years of $500 billion plus, there are a lot of other things we can do. For future generations, we ought to fix the Social Security system. Fix it, I mean by not making it a chain letter, by not creating a tremendous precipice of problems as it relates to the year 2018 or whenever the spiking of the baby boomers arrives and those necessary checks must go out to our citizens. We ought to fix it now. 
On that issue--I don't often side with this President--but I think he is right. We ought to use this opportunity to stabilize and change and adjust the Social Security system. 
By offering this amendment today, what my colleagues are not saying is don't fix Social Security. They are saying we have an opportunity to address a nagging problem inside the tax structure of this country, while at the same time we ought to deal with Social Security. I hope the House and the Senate, before we adjourn this fall, speak very clearly to these issues. The public deserves a tax cut. When you have a surplus that you have collected from the American taxpayer, you ought to give it back, or at least you ought to give a substantial portion of it back. 
Polling shows that the American public also expects us to pay off the debt, and one of the ways you pay off the debt or you eliminate a major portion of the debt structure of this country is by dealing with Social Security, because the debt is, in fact, the money that we have borrowed from the Social Security trust funds by the character of the unified budget under which we finance the activities of our Government. 
I am going to support Senator Ashcroft and Senator Brownback today in their effort. We must deal with this. It is timely that we deal with it now, and I think it is important that the Senate express itself with this opportunity. The marriage penalty is a major first step in addressing what needs to be significant tax reform in this country that I hope can come in the 106th Congress that will convene in January of next year. 
I applaud my colleagues today for bringing this issue to the floor for debate and for a vote, and I hope the Senate will concur with them. I yield the floor.

Mr. President, my amendment to the Kyl amendment attempts to clarify what I think is important that we do. The Indian Affairs Committee has the authority to hold hearings to move 
legislation, to bring it to the floor as it relates to Indian gaming. We created IGRA, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and the National Indian Gaming Commission for the purpose of regulating Indian gaming. Indian gaming is regulated. 
But the Senator from Arizona, without hearings on this in the authorizing committee, steps in and makes significant changes in the Indian gaming law. Now, the Senator from Arizona and I agree that gaming ought to be regulated; it ought to be controlled, the access ought to be controlled. We want it limited. But in this case, it isn't a matter of limiting, it is a matter of outlawing, stopping something that is already out there, already working, already has stood the test of officialdom, and we believe it meets those standards, and that is the National Indian Lottery. So I hope that my colleagues will stand with me in saying we want regulation and control.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona quotes a letter crafted in 1992. Since that time, the tribe in the State of Idaho has a compact that has been established. The attorney general of the State of Idaho believes this is significant. 
The topic of children is an interesting item. The Presiding Officer, I and everyone else is very concerned with children's access to the Internet. We recognize the need to provide legislation to block that, and we should. 
What I am talking about is something that is already official, that is already underway, and we have not heard a great hue and cry about the damaging of or the destruction of children. 
There is something else that is interesting. 
We heard from New Jersey and we heard from Nevada. They are protecting their big gaming interests. There are already exceptions in this bill. 
There are five exceptions in this bill to use the Internet system to traffic information about gaming. 
The Senator is not pure on this. Let's be real, and let's be honest about it. Let's use the committees we have. Let's use the law, the rules, and regulations to govern, control, and regulate Indian gaming structured in a certain way to protect it so that children don't have access to it; so that there is an official screening process; that it is effectively monitored and controlled. 
I agree that we ought to control the Internet system, and we ought to make sure that there is not unlimited access. That is exactly what we are trying to do here today. 
But let's not destroy the laws that we have created for Native Americans in this country--the controls, and the regulatory system that is established out there. 
We heard from the former chairman of the committee. We have already heard from the chairman of the committee. He is saying no hearings were held. A Senator from outside the committee reaches in and changes substantially the structure of the IGRA law and the National Indian Gaming Commission law. 
What I am telling you this morning is that you have an option to keep whole the law of the land, which we crafted to control Indian gaming, while at the same time protecting the Internet from open access from offshore gaming from the kind of things that the Senator from Arizona has an absolute right to be concerned about. I, too, am concerned, and I hope that my colleagues will join with me in voting for the Craig amendment to protect the integrity of the Indian Gaming Commission, and the national Indian gaming law that we have established. 
With that, I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues from Oregon, both of my colleagues from Oregon, and certainly the Senator from Florida, who have worked with us to craft the legislation that is now before you. 
For several years, I have tried to deal with the H-2A problem, only to be unsuccessful. I must tell you, Mr. President, I have watched the problem grow across America in a most inhumane way because the workforce is needed and the workers come. They come across our borders illegally, they are subjected to inhumane environments, in many instances, and, as a result, a great problem has grown, not only for a workforce seeking work, but also for the individual or individuals who provide the work, American agriculture. We have here a rare opportunity. It is an opportunity to fix a problem before it truly becomes a crisis on both sides. And in fixing that problem, my colleagues from Oregon and Florida, and myself involved, have attempted to approach it in a very commonsense way. 
That is to avoid the conflicts for millions of Americans, and recognizes, as Senator Wyden just said, that the American worker should come first, but in a state of near full employment where the unemployable, or those who choose not to work, are the only ones remaining. Clearly, we are at a point of crisis, and we must offer that opportunity to farm labor, to those who are willing to, and under a condition now that I think is much more presentable. 
Growers want and need a stable and predictable workforce, a legal workforce. They don't like playing around the edges of illegality. Let us make this workforce legal under the conditions that have been spelled out in this legislation. I think that provides a good, fair, market-based compensation. Prevailing wage is the wage issue here, and that is as it should be. 
Unemployed workers, and those hoping to move from welfare to work, want and need to be matched up with decent jobs. That is what our society ought to be directed toward. American citizens should have first claim, as I said, to American jobs, but all workers would rather be working legally and hope for protection of basic labor standards. 
These goals are not always met. In fact, current Federal law and its bureaucratic implementation are hurting growers and workers which have created a system that has created a monstrous bureaucracy. The Senator from Oregon talks of the multitude of pages necessary and in an attempt to determine who is and who isn't legal, of course, the employer oftentimes being held liable. 
This is why I am pleased I can join with my colleagues in proposing what I think is phenomenally constructive reform in the H-2A Agricultural Guest Worker Program. Failure to fix or replace this program means the Federal Government is completely ignoring the needs of a significantly changed agricultural labor market. 
Many employers who meet legal standards of diligence when they hire a worker really have no idea if the next raid by the Immigration and Naturalization Service will scare off their workforce and their crops will rot in the field. That is not an exaggeration. Just a few weeks ago that happened in the State of Georgia, just to our south: One county, a raid; the rest of the county was cleared out of a workforce which left crops rotting in the fields. It is an issue in Georgia, in Florida, in Idaho, in Oregon, in New York, in Kentucky--all over the country where this particular type of work force is necessary. 
California growers and local officials have made a real effort to address this shortfall with welfare-to-work efforts--which does not appear to be helping. 
The GAO study that has helped prompt the kind of urgency that the Senators from Oregon spoke to estimated that as many as 600,000 farm workers, or 37 percent of the 1.6 million, are not legally authorized to work in the United States--600,000. That is a problem, a very big problem, a problem created by laws and by a Department of Labor, and I am pleased that they have worked with us to resolve this issue. 
As workers disappear from U.S. fields--and crops stay there, instead of moving to stores and consumers--U.S. food will be replaced by foreign imported food. 
This means a mainstay in our economy--the U.S. agriculture industry--is threatened with a major breakdown. And our families are threatened with an increased risk to their health and safety because of food-borne diseases. 
Also, the current H-2A program has been a red-tape nightmare. Even when growers meet all deadlines, GAO found that DOL misses its statutory deadlines 40 percent of the time. 
The current H-2A program has been completely ineffective as a means of obtaining temporary and seasonal workers--supplying only about 24,000 out of 1.6 million farm workers. 
In the 1996 Immigration Law, and in appropriations over recent years, Congress has made it a priority to secure our borders and crack down on illegal immigration. 
What is needed is a bipartisan effort to reform the current H-2A system, having the following components: 
Creation of a new, voluntary national registry of migrant farmworkers to which growers can turn for workers they know are legal. 
If enough domestic workers cannot be supplied through the registry, growers could apply for legal guest workers through an expedited, reformed H-2A program. 
The new program would resemble current H-2A, but it would have faster turnaround, less red tape, and greater certainty for employers. 
It would also have continued protection for workers, and greater flexibility for employers, related to conditions of employment, such as housing, transportation, and market-based wages. 
I invite my colleagues to support me in this important endeavor. 
Mr. President, again, I appreciate the bipartisan work that has gone into this initiative and that we were able to bring it promptly to the floor. I hope there is a strong majority, a bipartisan vote in the Senate to move it to conference. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in section (2) of my original amendment, this was the same language with the same intent. Senator Specter, who has this initial program in Philadelphia, had some concerns about the language. I will be happy to provide you with a copy. It doesn't change the intent of the amendment at all. 
Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois, in all respects, I am sure, approaches this Senate with the right intent, an intent that I think all of us would honor--that is, to try to make the world a safer place, to try to make people more responsible. There is a problem, a very real problem. Our bills are different, and I think they are very incompatible in that regard. I hope the Senator from Illinois can support my legislation. I wish I could support his, but I cannot. 
Mr. President, here is the reason I cannot. The Senator from Illinois would like to take a victim and make that individual a criminal. In other words, if an adult owns a gun and a child of that adult, or a friend of that adult who happens to be less than 18 years of age, or a nephew, finds that gun and that gun is used in an accident or in the commission of a crime, or certainly when a death occurs, the victim--the person who had his or her gun stolen from them--all of a sudden becomes the criminal. That is an interesting juxtapose in our society from which we really have tried to stay away. We have focused on criminals and criminal acts. But a failure to make secure or to abide by what the Senator would say is a safekeeping of all 300 million guns in this society would make a person a criminal. 
We know how guns are used. In high crime areas, they are used for self-protection. In high crime areas and urban housing--not the nice, suburban household the Senator might envision in his debate--oftentimes a gun is kept loaded. Is that house totally secure? Do children come and go from it? Is it in a high-rise suburban environment, where there might be gang violence, where some members of gangs might have full access to the house because they are cousins or the children of that person using that gun for self-protection? That is very possible. Those exceptions are not provided for here. They must be provided for here if the Senator from Illinois is to have a law with any teeth in it. 
The reality is simple. We reverse, for the first time in our society, the kind of a test as it relates to an act of violence. In this case, the person who has the gun stolen from them all of a sudden becomes the criminal. That is an interesting and strange argument that we have never had put before us before. All of us are interested in controlling violent acts and criminal acts that occur in the commission of a crime. My amendment moves very directly to do that. 
In fact, my amendment is a movement in a direction that I think is extremely positive and is already underway. It is already underway because what it says is that the Federal firearm laws we have on the books will be implemented and they will be enforced. Judges don't like them. They don't like to play around with them. They don't necessarily like to prosecute them. Yet, where it happens, crime rates go down and life becomes much safer. 
What I am talking about and what I wish the Senate to vote on and place into law is the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, which is currently a 17-city demonstration project aimed at reducing youth firearm violence and expanding this initiative by putting some real teeth in it, much like the model of the Richmond, VA, program that I will discuss in a few minutes. My idea, although it is not novel, is that when most Federal firearm laws were enacted, the notion was to punish criminals who commit violent firearm crimes, not to go after the innocent victim who might have had their guns stolen from them. This has not happened. 
We already heard on the floor yesterday that this administration has cut the prosecution of violent acts where guns are used by nearly half. They simply don't pursue the criminal. Yet, it ought to happen. My amendment suggests that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, in consultation with the attorney general, work with the State of Pennsylvania and the city of Philadelphia to establish a demonstration program where the objective will be to identify, apprehend, and prosecute all persons who commit firearm violations. 
Let me tell you about something happening in Richmond, VA. Down there, a Federal prosecutor said to law enforcement officers, `If you will report to me felons who are arrested in the commission of a crime who are using a firearm, I will prosecute them. Plain and simple. No plea bargaining. We are going to prosecute.' That Federal officer handed out this little card to every cop in Richmond, VA. This card has a listing of all of the Federal gun possession crimes. It goes on to list them. There is a number to call. An individual officer can call the ATF, and there is a pager number. 
Here is the rest of the story. Gun-related homicides dropped from 140 last year to only 34 this year. 
Now, what I am saying is what we ought to be doing in Richmond and in Philadelphia, and a lot of other places across the Nation, is incorporating Federal authority along with local authority to go after the criminal who uses the gun. I am sure the Senator from Illinois and I have voted for laws or bills that create laws that say if you do thus and so, and you use a gun, it is a Federal firearms violation. But we don't get the courts to prosecute them, and we don't follow through; we don't insist. 
This administration, by their own statistics, has truly been asleep at the switch. Let's incorporate juveniles, education, tracking, gun trafficking, and all of those combinations together, and go after the people who are truly responsible. Guess what happens? The crime rate goes down. Incorporate that with the kind of work that has already been done and you will create a safer place. 
The Philadelphia Exile Project--generally called Project Exile all over the country--creates that kind of dynamic. Then I go on to expand it, so that we go from 50 cities to, by October of 2000, 75 cities, and by 2002, to 150 cities and counties across our country. This is the kind of proactive thing that goes directly at the problem. What does it say? It doesn't say to the innocent victim who has had their property stolen and it gets used in a crime, and if you didn't do all of these right things, guess what, you are the criminal. 
Now we haven't criminalized a child taking a car and having an accident against the parent--especially if they stole the car, took it without permission. Yet, today we would be doing that with guns. I think that is wrong. I think the Senator from Illinois is right. He should be able to support my amendment because it goes at the root cause. 
It incorporates all of the agencies, and it makes real the very thing that he and I want done. We want the laws enforced. We want criminals prosecuted. We know that 90 percent of the crime out there is the result of not new action, but old action --people with criminal records. That is what this is all about. 
We have taken the concept of going after the criminal, we have incorporated it with the juvenile crime gun interdiction initiative, brought those kind of things into combination, and I think we have a dynamic force here. 
What do we do? 
We provide new information about illegal firearm activities to communities. We identify differences in adult, juvenile, and youth illegal firearms activities. We extend access to firearm-related enforcement information. We initiate community, State, and national reporting on firearms trafficking. We enable enforcement officers to focus their resources where they are likely to have the greatest impact on illegal trafficking to juveniles and violent youth gang members. 
I think for those who were listening yesterday, when we look at the deaths created by juvenile activities with firearms today, the vast majority of the 95 percent are in that higher bracket. The accidental are there--not insignificant, but very, very small. 
That is the reality of what I attempt to do. It incorporates demonstration projects today that are working. It makes them Federal law. It expands them across the Nation. It goes after the criminal, and not the innocent victim who has had their property stolen. My colleague from Illinois would like to make them the criminal. That is a strange position to have in Federal law. We ought to leave that alone. 
I retain the remainder of my time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me only make a few comments as it relates to what Senator Chafee has said, because I think it is important that we understand the reality of some of what he has portrayed. The pit-bull argument sounds not only exciting, it sounds horrifying. Now, there is a little thing in law called, in this instance, the first bite. In other words, if it is known that the dog is dangerous, then there is a responsibility. If it is not known that the dog is dangerous and the dog has never shown dangerous tendencies, then the owner is not liable, and that has stood up in court. But if the dog is known to be dangerous, and the dog is chained in the backyard, and the backyard is fenced, and the gates are locked, and a child crawls in the range of the dog that is chained and is injured, the owner is not liable. 
But what the Senator is saying is, if you have a gun in your house and your house is gained access to by someone, oh, yes, if the door is open and a child invites another child in, and that child finds a gun and misuses it, then, of course, the owner of the gun is liable. 
I don't believe that is the pit-bull argument. And I don't think it can be, because the owner may have put the gun away, and did in this instance. 
What if the owner had it locked up but the child of the owner knew where the key was? Now, who is liable there? A lot of definitions go on wanting and my argument still holds, I do believe, that the victim in this instance, the owner of the gun, who has had the gun stolen from him, all of a sudden becomes the criminal. 
The pit-bull argument cannot and does not hold in this instance, nor should it. We understand those kinds of arguments. You can store your gun in safety, and all of a sudden it is taken and used and you are liable. The victim should not be the criminal. 
I retain the remainder of my time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let's talk about that tragic situation in Jonesboro, AR. What the Senator from Illinois is proposing would not have solved the problem in Jonesboro, AR, even though that young child obtained his gun from a grandfather who had locked his house and the child entered the home without permission and the gun was locked in a case. I don't know how we legislate against that. My guess is, we do not, not very successfully. All of a sudden grandpa becomes the criminal, and you are going to go after grandpa at a time when his grandchild has done that onerous act? 
Now, the Senator mentioned 15 States that have similar laws and yet the courts very seldom use them and juries very seldom give decisions because we know the parent is in a horrible situation at the time that kind of accident occurs. They are the victim, and they become the criminal. We all know that underage children in our care who act as those children do, we are every bit as much the victim. 
Why don't we pass the legislation that I have proposed that incorporates the forces of the Federal Government, the State government, and local government, and goes after criminals who use guns and criminal acts and bring down our crime rates and work to take the guns out of the hands of the juveniles where the killings are really going on in this country? 
No, it isn't as dramatic; it doesn't make for the political speech in the Chamber, but it sure makes the streets a lot safer. It doesn't take law-abiding citizens and make them criminals. That is what this Senate ought to be doing, and I hope the Senate will do that tonight. It is the right and the responsible approach. 
Let me, once again, briefly go through my proposal. It is patterned after the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative that is working right now in Philadelphia. It incorporates the Project Exile in Richmond, VA, where a Federal prosecutor says, `Report to me felons who are using a gun in the commission of a crime, and I will prosecute them, and I will put them away.' He has, and the crime rate has plummeted. Bring those two forces together and we make this world a safer place. And we take guns out of the hands of juveniles. 
No, we don't deal with the accident. I am not sure I know how to do that. I don't think we can do that here. I don't think we can make parents criminals. We have chosen not to do that in the past for a variety of reasons. We have argued safety. We have educated safety. We hope parents and adults will be responsible with their rights. In this instance there is a clear division. It is an important division. Our institutions have to recognize that juveniles in our society today are more violent than they have ever been, and we are searching for answers to that. We do not know all of the answers, but we do know we have a problem. Our problem is to penalize the parent who has tried to act responsibly? I don't think so. It is certainly our job to encourage greater parental responsibility, and we all know that a person who owns a gun in a law-abiding way has a responsibility for his or her right in this society. And we encourage that. But we say a $10,000 fine and a Federal offense and you are a criminal if somebody misuses the gun? I hope not. I hope that is not the case. 
I retain the remainder of my time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand on the floor this evening in support of the concept of the Kyl bill, and I support the second-degree amendment that the Senator from Nevada has just successfully placed on it. 
I believe that unregulated Internet gaming is and can be dangerous. It must be monitored closely and restricted to adults. 
To date, the only form of gaming regulated at the Federal level is Indian gaming. I am not a big fan of most Indian gaming. We have struggled with it in my State for some time. However, through the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, known as IGRA, Congress established clear and precise laws governing all forms of Indian gaming. 
Authority to regulate Indian gaming was given by Congress to the National Indian Gaming Regulatory Commission. In addition, developments in Indian gaming are followed closely by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and its counterparts in the House. In fact, it is my understanding that the committee has held a series of hearings this year on examining the possible changes in IGRA. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-craig-id-14-19980722</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. CRAIG. What I want to point out is that there is an established procedure in dealing with laws which impact Indian gaming. 
Mr. President, the Kyl bill ignores this procedure and changes IGRA without the input of the Indian Affairs Committee or the National Indian Gaming Regulatory Commission. The Kyl bill does this in a number of ways, including placing new restrictions on tribal gaming operations, overrides and nullifies existing State tribunal pacts, makes illegal some forms of Indian gaming determined by the courts to be authorized under IGRA. 
Those who would support the bill claim that it does not impact IGRA. I cannot agree with that argument. If it, in fact, sought no change in IGRA, why do they then oppose the amendment that would guarantee no change? Because that is exactly what my amendment does. The truth of the matter is that the bill severely limits authority granted IGRA. 
The Craig amendment does not expand Indian gaming. Let me repeat: The Craig amendment does not expand Indian gaming. And that would be argued by the Federal courts. The amendment would only protect a gaming enterprise if it were already legal under IGRA. The amendment would only protect a gaming enterprise that was already sanctioned by a State-tribal compact, the very kind of thing that this Congress set up in the law that created IGRA. 
The amendment would not allow for any form of new Indian gaming. The reason these issues are important--and the Senator from Arizona was exactly right when he spoke in general terms about the possibilities of my amendment, speaking specifically to one Indian tribe. That Indian tribe happens to be in my State, and they have established what is known as the National Indian Lottery. 
They have withstood three separate Federal court tests and have argued that they are legal, and the courts have so ruled. Yet, the Internet Gaming Prohibition Act that Senator Kyl has just offered amends section 1084 of the so-called Federal Wire Act to include lotteries. Only by his act would they become illegal. 
By the current law, and by the current regulatory process, they are legal; and they have been found that. This tribe has been sued. They have taken their issue to court and have successfully won. Lotteries are defined as class III gaming and are governed by the terms of the tribal-State compacts, the rules and the regulations, the National Indian Gaming Commission. Idaho's case is no different. And that is certainly the case that I argue here tonight. 
In 1992, the Coeur d'Alene Tribe signed a compact with the State of Idaho which specifically provided for the conduct of these National Indian Lottery games. Article 621 of the compact authorizes the tribe to conduct lotteries, so-called State lotteries to the compact, defined in article 419, to include a variety of things. 
The compact was approved by the Secretary of the Interior in February 1993, and, therefore, noticed in the Federal Registry. Since that time it has fallen under regulation. What the Senator from Arizona is doing tonight--and I agree with him--is making illegal that which is unregulated, and provides either an outright prohibition or establishes regulatory effort. 
Now, he has exempt a variety of things, exempt very powerful gaming organizations. So I do not think the Senator can argue tonight that there have not been some exemptions. He says he is after the offshore kind of Internet activity. I agree with him. The kind I am trying to protect is onshore, legal and regulated by IGRA and the National Indian Gaming Commission. I could not stand here tonight and argue for an unregulated activity. We expect them to be fair. We expect them to be honest. We expect them to be controlled and only to be made available to adults. That is exactly what is happening here and why I argue it. 
All of the regulations that this Congress has put in place is adhered to by the National Indian Lottery. It is regulated, as I said, at the Federal level. It is regulated at the State level. It is regulated at the separate governmental or tribal level. And that is the way it should be. It is audited regularly by Arthur Andersen. It is protected so that only adults can participate in it. And that is constantly scanned. 
My amendment would simply say that these kinds of activities--legally sought--would be regulated under the current regulatory process, because it is Indian gaming; and we have established the IGRA and the National Indian Gaming Commission for that purpose. The amendment of the Senator from Arizona would deny that right and place, by its adoption, this as an illegal activity where the Federal courts have ruled that under current process it is legal. 
With that, I yield the floor.

We move the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, that is now a demonstration project in Philadelphia, nationwide over a period of 5 years. With the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, working with counties, States and local law enforcement agencies, 
to provide information on the illegal activity of firearms in communities, to create adult, juvenile and youth illegal firearm activities, identify them and control them, to make firearm violations Federal violations prosecutable and move it in that direction. 
Mr. President, if this Senate wants to move against youth violence with the misuse of firearms, this is a major initiative and a major step in that direction. I hope my colleagues will work with us as we expand this from 17 demonstration projects to 50 to 75 to 150 across the Nation in high-crime areas going directly at juveniles and the misuse of firearms and prosecuting felons who use firearms in the commission of a crime, which is already a Federal violation of law, but now goes unprosecuted. 
I hope my colleagues can join with me in supporting this amendment.

Don't fall for the analogy of the pit bull. If the pit bull is chained in the backyard, and there is a fence around the yard, and the yard is locked and somebody gets in that yard and inside the circle of the pit bull and is injured, it is not the owner's fault. That is the law. 
I hope you can join with me in opposing this. Don't make the victim the criminal. Don't say that the person should become a Federal criminal who is not even associated with the crime.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I think many of us have spoken tonight to the issue of Internet gaming and our opposition to it; most assuredly, our opposition to unregulated offshore Internet gaming. The Senator from Arizona has brought forth an amendment that controls that, in fact, prohibits that. But it also prohibits something else that we in the Congress and law, by agreements, treaties with American Indians, have said is separate, should be, and should be regulated. And we have said Indian gaming should be regulated. And it is. But the Senator from Arizona has made the exception as it relates to any Indian gaming on the Internet. I am saying, that is an intrusion that should not be allowed. 
Regulate? Absolutely. Control? Absolutely. Build and maintain a tribal-State compact? Absolutely. We have wrestled with this issue over the years. When I was in the House, I worked with a Congresswoman from Nevada. We were outruled by the courts. The Senator from Hawaii has clearly spoken to the issue of the courts. 
What I am saying is that I sense there is a clear and important division. Through the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, Congress established a clear and precise law governing all forms of Indian gaming. And I think it is important that I repeat that--all forms of Indian gaming. Authority to regulate Indian gaming was given by Congress to the National Indian Gaming Regulatory Commission. 
I believe the Kyl bill ignores this procedure and IGRA. I do not believe we can ignore that as a Congress. The Kyl bill does this in a number of ways, including placing new restrictions on tribal gaming operations, and overrides and nullifies existing State-tribal compacts. 
My amendment simply sets the issue of Indian gaming aside as it pertains to that. But it recognizes, as I think we all should, that Indian gaming via the Internet ought to be regulated and it ought to be controlled. And that is exactly what is happening today. 
So I hope that for any of my colleagues who might be listening this late into the evening, that we could revisit this for a short time tomorrow, because the Internet Gaming Prohibition Act by Senator Kyl goes in and amends section 1084 of the Federal Wire Act to include lotteries. It is excluded there today. Decisions have been rendered on behalf of Indians as it relates to this in Federal courts. We think this is the appropriate decision, and it exempts them currently. And they are regulated now. 
This is not an unregulated activity that I advocate by this amendment. It is a fully regulated activity under Federal law, under the Indian gaming laws as controlled by the National Indian Gaming Commission. That is the appropriate intent of this amendment. 
I retain the balance of my time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, a few moments ago you talked about this destroying lottery systems. The national Indian lottery is up and operating today, and State lotteries are not falling by the wayside. In fact, they are stronger than ever in their level of participation. They are as tightly regulated as is this national lottery. That is the reality with which we talk about this, tightly regulated control. 
Do I advocate 10-year-olds using this? I do not, and they cannot. There is a screening process. They would be in violation of it. They would have to go through all of the procedures of an adult. Yes, I guess if they stole their parent's credit card in the first instance it might work; in the second, it would not. Any winnings would be repealed and they might be in violation of the law. 
So you can talk about scare tactics, if you will. The reality is we have a national Indian lottery today that is deemed legal on the Internet. The amendment by Senator Kyl attempts to make it illegal. That is the reality with which we are dealing. I suggest that any effort to talk about great fears and scare tactics just doesn't fit because it is tightly, tightly controlled. 
What the Senator from Arizona talks about, about offshore, I agree with an unlimited approach in an unregulated way. That is what is important. That is what my amendment does. We should allow Indian gaming to be regulated under Federal law as it currently is.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have before us this afternoon an amendment offered by the Senator from California that is one of those feel-good amendments. Obviously, the Senator from Illinois has taken the feel-good debate to its ultimate. All of us are dramatically concerned and frustrated when anyone dies in this country accidentally. There is no question that there is always a quick rush to mind saying that there ought to be a law against that--especially if it appears to be an accidental death that occurred because somebody was negligent. Even more reason to want to do something to disallow that kind of an accident from happening. 
Now, I do not apologize for the fact that I am an active member of the National Rifle Association, and I believe in trigger locks. I agree with the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from California that trigger locks ought to be employed in the storage of a gun for safekeeping reasons, but I do not believe trigger locks ought to be used on loaded guns. 
The gun that killed the child that the Senator from California so dramatically spoke of was a loaded gun, and therein lies the difference. No FBI agent, no Federal agent of law enforcement in our country or State or local law enforcement agent with proper firearm training ever puts a trigger lock on a loaded gun. Why? Because the manufacturer says don't do it. And why does the manufacturer say don't do it? Because trigger locks are not a guarantee of safety--a jostling of the trigger lock, a dropping of the gun, a jamming of the trigger lock object that surrounds the encasing for the trigger could cause it to fire. 
That is the reality. I know. I am a pistol shooter. I know about which I speak. But I am for trigger locks. I am for gun safes. I am for drawers with locks on them because I want firearms safely stored in this country so that the citizens who use firearms legally under the second amendment can be guaranteed that that right will never be abridged. 
What the Senator from Illinois talks about this afternoon is, in fact, tragic, and, of course, the Judiciary Committee spoke to this issue and said that everyone ought to be made aware of them. Certainly everyone who purchases a gun ought to have a full understanding and knowledge of the use of trigger locks for safekeeping. Should it be a Federal mandate? I don't think so. 
Most importantly, it should not offer a sense of false security. That is what is important. And yet I will tell you that the Senator from California speaks of panaceas: But for the trigger lock no child will die. The Senator from Illinois: But for a trigger lock the world will be safer. No, it won't be if the gun is loaded. Now, if the person who owns the firearm is responsible, if the person who owns the firearm does not plan to use it for personal protection and needs it immediately for their access or personal protection, that gun ought to be unloaded. The ammunition ought to be stored separately from the firearm. That is the rule of the game. That is what you are supposed to do as a law-abiding citizen. That is how you properly handle a firearm. 
Well, let's talk about tragedies in this country. There is no question that when a small child finds a firearm which a parent has left loaded, and that small child plays with it and either kills him or herself or kills a brother or sister, oh, my goodness, what a phenomenal tragedy. I mourn; we all mourn. Parents who have acted so irresponsibly as to cause their child to die under those circumstances are the responsible parties. The gun should have been unloaded. The gun should have been properly stored. If it were unloaded, it should have a trigger lock on it. But it does not happen that way all the time. Cars are never intended to kill people, but they kill people every day. Teenagers should drive safely, but they don't. They are very irresponsible at that age. Dramatic accidents happen such as just happened on the East-West Highway locally and teenagers are killed by a very safe car. They acted irresponsibly. They should not have done what they did. 
While the number of privately owned firearms in this 
country has quadrupled since 1930, the annual number of accidental fatalities--and that is what the Senator from Illinois is talking about, accidents--not intentional shootings, accidents--the number of accidents involving fatalities with firearms has declined 56 percent nationwide, against a phenomenal increase in the number of firearms owned by citizens, law-abiding citizens. We don't count the criminals. 
Firearms are involved in 1.5 percent of accidental fatalities nationwide, and they are oftentimes the most dramatic or they are oftentimes the most dramatized on the front page of a local, State or national newspaper. And I know why. Because the Senators from Illinois and California speak with the same emotion I do, especially when it is a small child who is involved in that kind of a situation. But let me tell you what is going to kill small children this summer on a 5-to-1, 6-to-1, 10-to-1 basis. It is not going to be a gun. It is not going to be a gun. It is going to be the very thing that the Senator from Illinois has in his drinking glass right now. It is going to be water. More children are going to drown this summer in neighborhood pools and backyard swimming pools--by the hundreds--than will die by a gunshot. And yet the Senator from Illinois is not proposing to outlaw or put locks on swimming pools. 
Now, all of those deaths are just as accidental. But, you know, one size fits all and if we have a Federal law, it is going to take care of everybody, and everybody will be safe and the world will be better, and politics will be more clear. 
It does not work that way. It should not work that way. We are supposed to be a land without Federal mandates, and yet this year more children are going to die by drowning. Remember, accidental fatalities this year: 4.8 percent by drowning, 1.5 percent by a firearm. But if you really want to get big numbers, more children are going to die this year by falling, probably out of the high chair under the supervision of a careful mother who accidentally turns away or inadvertently turns away or momentarily turns away from her infant child, or maybe the father, and that number is going to be about 13.5 percent, but that does include older people, too. In other words, the reality with which we speak this afternoon is not all black and white, not at all. Death by falling, 13.5 percent; vehicles, cars, 47 percent; poisoning, 11 percent. 
When somebody dies by poisoning or by accidental poisoning, it isn't as dramatic because the national media isn't as intent on getting rid of our second amendment rights, so they don't publicize that as much. And they really don't have anything against backyard swimming pools so that only usually is covered by the local or the State media simply because of the tragedy of the loss. 
Well, those are the realities with which we speak on this issue. Proper storage of firearms is the responsibility of every gun owner, and also education, safety, training and careful consideration. 
All factors that relate to an individual's particular needs are key to this responsibility. That is really the issue here. And I know the Senator from Illinois and I would wish that everybody was appropriately educated on gun ownership, had been through the right schooling or the right training, would always unload their firearm and store it a long way away from its ammunition. 
That is not what happens. People oftentimes become not careless, but they just assume. We have seen teenagers breaking into homes. That is stealing. That is theft. And yet we pass laws on that. We have laws against teenagers breaking into homes and stealing things, including guns, and yet they still do it. That is why it is important that we talk about this issue this afternoon. Oh, it is politically very popular. It is the right thing to do in an election year, but it may be the wrong thing to do when it comes to safety and security if it isn't appropriately handled. I recommend trigger locks. If I owned a pistol--and I don't--I would have a trigger lock on it. And it would be empty with a trigger lock on it. But that is the reality of the kind of issues that we debate here. 
A general firearm safety rule that must be applied to all conditions is that a firearm should be stored so that it is not accessible to untrained or unauthorized people. 
That is the right rule. That is the one that really fits. That is the one that really works well. And then you don't have the accidents to talk about. 
Antigun groups overstate the number of firearm-related deaths among children by defining `children' to include anyone through the age of 19. The statistics that have been talked about here on the floor include teenagers acting violently. The reason is, 84 percent of firearm-related deaths--that includes homicide, suicides, and accidents among persons zero to 19 years of age--are accounted for by adolescents and young adults from 15 to 19; 84 percent, 15 to 19 years of age. 
No; the examples cited by the Senator from California, while very dramatic and very emotional, are clearly the exception, the horrible exception, and not the rule. So, when we talk statistics this afternoon, and we talk about children, we are talking about zero to 19, by those statistics. At least that is what I am told. 
The anti-firearm Children's Defense Fund and other gun control advocates have applied, if you will, the trick to all of the national statistics and data relating to that 1 child for every 90-odd minutes, 10 children out of 5,000--all of those figures. The reality is zero to 19, if anyone listening is interested in those kinds of statistics. 
So a few moments ago I was giving you figures about these dramatic deaths that occur when a firearm is misused. The annual number of firearm accidents among children in 1995 fell to an all-time low in 1995--181 children. That is below the age of 15. We are pleased about that number, although terribly saddened, because I think some of the educational programs that some independent groups are using out there right now are helping educate young people to stay away from firearms if they don't understand them and if they have not been properly trained to use them. 
Other types of accidental fatalities among children--children of the same category--where there were 181 killed by firearms, there were 3,095 killed in auto accidents. The Senator who is presiding at this moment has worked to dramatically lessen the impact of airbags when they are deployed because mishandled, and the child in an improper seat can be killed by an airbag in a car. I am not sure this Congress has responded to that in a timely and appropriate fashion, although Senator Kempthorne has worked over time to make that happen. It just so happens, it is a 30-to-1 relationship of children who will be killed in auto accidents every year compared to those young people who might be killed by the mishandling of a gun. 
I mentioned the local swimming pool. It is a hot day out there. We are fortunate being in an air-conditioned building. Tragically enough, there will probably be more children drowned today across this country accidentally than will be killed by a firearm. The statistics bear it out--1,024 in 1995 killed by drowning. 
Fires, suffocation, falling--I have talked percentagewise. Let's talk statistics. Fires: 833 children burned to death in 1995; suffocation, ingestion of an object--we have all--not all of us, many of us--have raised small children. We know how frightened we are about a child's choking on an object, getting something in that mouth, picking up something and swallowing it. Mr. President, 213 will die, on an average basis, annually because of that. We haven't outlawed small objects, I guess because we cannot, although some here 
might want to try. But that is the reality of what we deal with. 
And the statistics go on and on. There were 44,583 deaths amongst children in 1995; .04 percent firearms. All the rest were the kinds of things that we can do very little about. We should try where we can. We can change the deployment impact of airbags. We probably cannot outlaw backyard swimming pools. We probably cannot mandate better caretakership at the community swimming pool. And somehow, we just can't teach moms and dads about child safety seats and not putting young children in the front seats of their cars. And that still goes on. 
So, those are some of the facts and statistics that we will talk about today, probably more than once, as we deal with this issue. 
I do not in any way try to misrepresent the intent of the Senators who have offered the amendment. But I will speak to reality based on knowledge. Manufacturers and anyone else knowledgeable in the use of a firearm will say not a trigger lock on a loaded gun--no, no, not at all--because you risk even a greater chance of accidental death. Trigger locks are recommended and should be used on unloaded guns. But that is the reality. So if we mandate it by Federal law, we risk even greater numbers of accidents. You even risk a great number of people violating laws because of the inability to accommodate or live up to this. That is the issue we deal with. That is the issue we will debate for a substantial period of time today. 
It is very important that we understand it, because, try as we may as a Congress with good intent, as a Senate and Senators who care a great deal, we cannot legislate out of this life of ours accidental death or we wouldn't have any of the 44,000 children who will die this year die, be it by gun or by car or by drowning or by falling or by choking. 
Let me close by saying I forgot to talk about the bicycle and the tricycle and the accidents that occur when children use those in an unsupervised way. We read about that on a regular basis, tragically enough. But I don't think the Senate is going to try to outlaw the tricycle or bicycle today--only the gun--or at least legislate it being mandated as to its management, its handling. That is the issue. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sent the amendment to the desk. I thank my colleagues from California and Illinois for raising the issue of firearms safety. All of us are concerned about it. We should be. There is no question that this Senate should express itself. But I think it is wrong to suggest that one size fits all and that Washington has the right answer. Even as the Senator from California was speaking, she was talking about local community and State law that was changing the character of gun ownership and the management or the safe handling of guns. And that is exactly what my amendment offers. 
It recognizes that there is no quick fix to the tragedy of juvenile crime and firearm accidents. But it does recognize the importance of making available safety devices of all kinds to fit all circumstances, not just a trigger lock but a safe, a box, a lockbox, all of those kinds of things that should be required and made available to gun purchasers by the community of interests that sells guns and small business people who offer those types of firearms to the public. 
First, it expands the definition of `safety devices' to include, as I have mentioned, a variety of devices besides just trigger locks. I think it is important that we do that. 
My amendment requires that vendors have these safety devices available for sale, but it does not require that a vendor sell a safety device along with every firearm. It certainly does say that a vendor must make these available and that the purchasing public become aware of it. 
It is also important that my amendment helps to ensure that this new requirement is entirely tort neutral. The amendment provides that it does not establish a standard of care or it further states that evidence regarding compliance or noncompliance with this requirement is inadmissible in court. The amendment, therefore, does not hurt nor help a plaintiff or a defendant. 
Finally, my amendment helps to ensure that State and local authorities are prepared to train members of the public in the safe possession, carrying, and use of firearms. As you know, 34 States have now passed and empowered our citizens to carry concealed weapons for protection. Therefore, it is critical that we as a citizenry advance the cause of education. 
My amendment allows for Byrne grant funds to be used by State and local law enforcement agencies to train the public in the safe handling of firearms and to make a positive contribution in that education. The statistics that are real that I have spoken to this afternoon and that the Senator from California has spoken to can be dramatically reduced by education, by training, and by understanding. It is evident because we see the decline in gun accidents today. 
We also know that there are a variety of organizations out there that are actively involved in working to train our citizens as it relates to the safe use of firearms. So my amendment is much broader. It is not a mandate, but it certainly requires the full complement of gun safety equipment and necessary attributes to be sold and made available to gun owners, and it provides education and educational moneys for local and State law enforcement agencies to begin to train and 
educate our citizenry as it relates to this important issue. 
More and more States are moving to the right of citizens to carry guns. Thirty-four States have now said, by their action, that the citizen is empowered to carry a weapon for the purpose of protection; yet there is a decline in the number of accidental deaths by guns. That can come, as it is coming, by education. We are empowering, by this amendment, our State and local governments to do just that. 
Let me close by saying this: The provision that I offer is an amendment that was offered and adopted by the Judiciary Committee last year during its markup on S. 10, the juvenile crime bill. I urge my colleagues to agree with the consideration and the judgment of the Judiciary Committee. Senator Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is a cosponsor with me of this amendment. It has had full consideration and acceptance by that committee. 
So it is not something that is quick to judge. It is something to recognize that as we debate the safety of the use of firearms, that we assure the public the availability of equipment and devices to ensure and broaden that safety and, most importantly, it provide the necessary educational components to offer that.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, 72 of you have just said that gun safety is important, and that we ought to educate, and we ought to use Byrne funds to do so--local law enforcement, State law enforcement, and private entities that teach licensed gun safety. 
We have also said that gun dealers ought to have safety devices available. But we have also said there is a States rights issue here. Thirty-four States now have consent to carry. Safety is an issue. And guess what. Accidental deaths are declining, and they are declining because of education, not because of Federal mandates. Even manufacturers say you put a trigger lock on a loaded gun and it is dangerous. 
Trigger locks I agree with. They are for empty guns. They are for stored guns. They are not called child locks, they are called safety locks. We believe in that. But why should it be a Federal mandate? It should not be. 
The vote you just cast is the right vote. It mandates certain requirements at the local level be provided, and it allows education, and, more importantly, it says train and educate, don't control from the Federal level. Do the right thing. Vote to table. You have cast a sound vote; 72 Senators have said that the right action was the action you have just taken.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate the willingness of the Senator from Illinois to modify his amendment. I think it is necessary and appropriate, and certainly the public understands that hunting is a lawful right and opportunity in this country. Certainly, foreign citizens who are here that go through the legal and necessary steps should be allowed that opportunity, and to acquire a gun for that purpose while here is necessary and fitting. 
I agree with the Senator from Illinois that he deals with a very important area of the law. We have seen it misused by aliens in this country. Our second amendment is something that we honor, that many of us feel is a very important right of our citizens under the Constitution. It should not be abused by those who are guests in our country, legally or illegally. I think the Senator from Illinois speaks clearly to that in the amendment. I appreciate his offering it.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today legislation is being introduced by my colleague from Oregon, Gordon Smith, along with Senators Wyden, Graham of Florida, Gorton, Bumpers, and McConnell. This bill would deal with a situation that is a problem today and could well be a crisis tomorrow. The Senate now has an opportunity to do what our Federal Government does all too rarely, and that is fix a problem in a timely and commonsense fashion before it inflicts great hurt on millions of Americans. 
Mr. President, I am talking about agricultural growers and their need for a stable, predictable, legal workforce that would receive good, fair, market-based compensation. 
I am talking about unemployed workers and those hoping to move from welfare to work, who want and need to be matched up with agricultural jobs, if possible. American citizens should have first claim to American jobs. All workers would rather be working legally and know they can claim full legal protections only when their employment situation is open and lawful. 
Farm employers need to be provided with a secure work force. Workers need to be assured of basic legal and labor standard protections. 
These goals are not being met today. In fact, current federal law, and its bureaucratic implementation, are hurting growers and workers. 
In fact, current Federal laws and their bureaucratic implementation are hurting both growers and workers. This is why I am pleased to join with my colleagues in the introduction of what we will call AgJOBS. This stands for the Agricultural Job Opportunity, Benefits and Security Act. 
This bill will represent the culmination of work that has been going on for years amongst our colleagues, to resolve the issue of the necessary labor force for American agriculture. We have examined all of the issues involved with trying to ensure a supply of legal temporary and seasonal labor. We understand that that employers in many cases need guest workers and that employees, domestic and guest workers, need more and better jobs. We have looked at all sides. The result is a consensus bill that we think is nothing less than remarkable, and I commend my colleagues on this very important bipartisan effort. 
The key elements of our bipartisan proposal would include the following: The creation of a new, voluntary, national registry of migrant farm workers to which growers can turn for workers they know are legal. If enough domestic workers could not be supplied through the registry, growers could apply for legal guest workers through an expedited, reformed H-2A program. The new program would resemble the current H-2A program, but it would have much, much faster turnaround, less red tape, and greater certainty for employers, continued protections for workers, and greater flexibility for employers, related to conditions of employment such as housing, transportation, and market-based wages. 
The crisis is at hand not only on the farm but with the worker who is attempting to get across our borders today. With the tremendous heat in the South right now, there are warnings out to workers hoping for a job opportunity in this country: Do not try to traffic the area or you could die--simply by using the transportation methods in which so many workers are travelling today. Current law has created a phenomenal situation that is most inhumane. 
Two years ago, Senators Wyden, Gorton, and others joined with me in requiring the General Accounting Office to study the current H-2A Guest Worker Program. 
As a result, the GAO has estimated that at least 37 percent of all farm workers in the United States are not here legally, not legally qualified to work. How they got the figure is amazing: They went out and asked, and the workers, by self-disclosure, admitted that they were here illegally. 
The current H-2A program has been a red tape nightmare. 
Too often, when growers need a timely response to their needs, with produce in the field, it cannot be done. 
Even when growers meet all the deadlines the Government sets for them, then the Government fails to meet its own deadlines. In fact, GAO's study found that, when growers made timely applications, the Department of Labor still missed statutory deadlines 40 percent of the time. 
The bureaucracy grinds to a halt sometimes because it doesn't understand the needs in the field, and sometimes because it doesn't want to supply the workforce. 
Current H-2A has been completely ineffective as a means of obtaining temporary and seasonal workers, supplying only about 24,000 out of the 1.6 million farm workers necessary on an annual basis. 
In the 1996 immigration law, and in appropriations over recent years, Congress has made it a priority to secure our borders and crack down on illegal immigrants. 
That is exactly what we want and what our citizens want. 
But as a result, serious spot shortages of farm labor are multiplying from Florida to New England, Kentucky to Colorado--to California and Idaho, and across the Nation. 
For example, California growers and local officials have made a real effort to address the shortfall with welfare-to-work efforts. But it is not happening. We are at near full employment in our economy. People are simply not available to do agricultural-style work. And sometimes the needs of agriculture are uniquely not matched to the needs or capabilities of available domestic workers. 
Because of the robust counterfeit ID industry and current Federal laws, we have many of these illegals moving into our country who are, in fact, carrying what appear to be legal credentials. Employers do not want that to happen, but the law actually punishes them if they are too diligent in inquiring about the legal status of job applicants. Current law has created an unwinnable Catch-22 for employers. Most have no realistic way of ensuring their work force is entirely legal. 
A single Immigration and Naturalization Service raid, netting a handful of illegal workers, can scare and clean out thousands of workers in surrounding counties. It happened just a few weeks ago in the Georgia onion fields. The employers in such cases typically have complied with the law. But, of course, the crops were left rotting in the fields. That is not what the American farmer needs. It is certainly not what the American consumers need. 
As workers disappear from U.S. fields, and crops stay there instead of moving to the stores, not only are the farmers hurt, as I mentioned, but consumers are hurt. And then we have to reach inevitably toward an effort to import foods, much of which may not meet our health and safety standards. This means a mainstay of our economy, the U.S. agriculture industry, is threatened with a major breakdown. This means that our families are threatened with the increased risk of exposure to food-borne illnesses on imported, foreign foods. And it happens simply because the current H-2A system won't supply the kind of labor that is necessary. 
Let's be humane and let's be responsible. Let's move the AgJOBS bill introduced today, so it can be signed on the President's desk and become law this year. It is critically necessary that we do this. 
We have reached out to the Department of Labor to work with them and be sensitive to their concerns in the crafting of this legislation to streamline the H-2A program. We have tried to anticipate and answer every objection that might be raised to this kind of reform. We have tried to solve problems before bringing this bill to the floor. 
I thank my colleagues for this tremendous effort, especially Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, Senator Wyden, Senator Graham of Florida, and Senator Gorton, who have worked very closely, to make this legislation a reality. 
We think this bill will create a win-win situation so those who wish to enter our country to work at our agricultural jobs can enter legally, so they can enter in a safe way instead of in the backs of trucks or almost literally in tin cans where, as a result of tragic accidents, they oftentimes lose their lives. We saw another tragic example of this in recent days. 
We can do better. We can pass the AgJOBS reforms. I am pleased to be a part of the introduction of this legislation today.

Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I chose not to offer an amendment on VA-HUD, and I thank Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski for the tremendous work that they have done. 
For a few moments, if I can have the attention of the Senate, Madam President, I want to speak to an issue that is not unlike what the Senator from Nebraska spoke to last evening, a very real concern of mine and the Idaho congressional delegation and the citizens of our State. This is an issue that particularly affects north Idaho, the beautiful lakes and the mountains that we are so proud of in my State and that many of you have come to enjoy. 
As I said, I was prepared to offer an amendment that would assure the Environmental Protection Agency would participate in the mediation process that is currently underway in my State over the issue of the Coeur d'Alene Basin. 
On May 4 of 1998, U.S. News & World Report published an article dealing with supposed pollution in the Coeur d'Alene Lake and Basin. I read the article with near disbelief. For the first 2 1/2 pages, I read of a land fouled by pollution, of poisoned fish and dying wildlife, and the Idaho congressional delegation `scrambling' to block the creation of a Superfund site of over 1,500--let me repeat--a Superfund site proposed of over 1,500 square miles in my State stretching into the State of Washington and the Pacific Northwest. 
I read the article and said, could this be the land that I know and love, a land of beautiful forests, mountains, lakes, rivers, the Coeur d'Alene area, `considered to be one of the most beautiful mountain lakes in the world'? I have put this in quotes because it is a direct quote from the web site of the Coeur d'Alene Basin Indians. The Coeur d'Alene Indians talk about the beauty of the land, and yet the Coeur d'Alene Tribe has also filed a lawsuit asking for a Superfund natural resource damage settlement in the basin that could be up to $1 billion. 
One would believe that another study is needed to understand the horrible pollution that is described in the beginning of that article. 
But then I arrived on page 3 of the U.S. News & World Report article and read about the lake, this beautiful lake that I have just spoken of, a lake that meets Federal drinking water standards and that the sediments in the lake are not known to be causing problems. Indeed, thousands of people swim in this lake every year. They boat in its waters; they fish, they camp and recreate along its shores. 
Over the Fourth of July break, just a few weeks ago, 40,000 to 100,000 people came to recreate in and around Lake Coeur d'Alene. Several communities draw their drinking water from the river below the lake. The water they consume continually meets tough Federal drinking water standards. 
A recently completed statistical validation study by the State of Idaho, with assistance from the Coeur d'Alene tribe and a toxicologist at the Federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, with data analysis from the Federal Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, have said and found no contaminated fish in the waters of this lake. 
The Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies have spent millions of dollars from the public coffers to study the situation. Lawyers are litigating and making hundreds of thousands of dollars and building beautiful homes along the lake's shore from the money they make from this lawsuit as they describe the poisonous sediments of this lake. Now, remember, this is the lake that I just said meets Federal drinking water standards. 
What is going on up there? Well, it is not unlike what the Senator from Nebraska talked about last night--an EPA that just keeps on running and keeps on moving and pushing the regulations when there is no basis under Federal law and tests for that. Looks like they have just got to have something to do. 
Should we be looking for ways to address the problem rather than pursuing study after study that appears to lead to more studies? Well, I think the answer is yes. That is why the Idaho congressional delegation has introduced legislation to improve cleanup efforts rather than to fuel more lawsuits and spend more taxpayers' dollars studying the already well-defined problem. 
This legislation has been approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. This is what we need to do in the Coeur d'Alene Basin. We need to stop EPA and work to resolve the issue instead of spreading it to a 1,500-square-mile area. It is impossible to believe that when we created the Superfund law that we were intending EPA to even reasonably think about an area of 1,500 square miles. That is bigger than some States here on the east coast. 
I have not offered the amendment because EPA is now beginning to negotiate with the State of Idaho. I hope they can continue to work together to resolve this issue and not expand a Superfund site beyond the limited one we have that is now being well addressed and properly cared for. 
I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Bond, for being reasonable and working with us on this issue. 
But EPA ought to get the message, and the Justice Department ought to get the message: Politics is one thing, but spending America's taxpayer money--millions and millions of dollars--to play the political game is yet another thing. To tie up the beautiful Lake Coeur d'Alene and the city of Coeur d'Alene, one of the No. 1 destination sites in the Nation for tourism and recreation, an area that you can walk out into the lake and swim in the lake and drink the water, and yet EPA is suggesting, and the Coeur d'Alene Indians are suggesting, that this should be a Superfund site? I would hope not. 
In fact, I hope this Congress would wake up to the games that have been played in the EPW Committee not to allow Superfund reauthorization out because somehow it does not fit the politics of the current administration. It does not make a lot of sense, certainly does not make any sense in Idaho. 
I hope EPA will continue to negotiate with our State to resolve this issue. If not, the Idaho congressional delegation will be forced to take quick action to resolve the issue here. I think finally we are going to get the understanding of our colleagues because of their recognizing that Superfund does not work anymore. It just means a lot of lawsuits and a lot of politics. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my colleagues from North Dakota for the sincere effort they have made and the willingness of the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee to review this and help them shape it and accept it. 
Certainly, as we get to conference, there is going to be every effort made by this Senator and others to provide what can be provided, and to resolve, as best we can, this impending farm crisis. We clearly understand the problem, the growing problem, and we know that certain actions here can be very, very helpful. I am pleased to be a participant in this, to be supportive of it. I am sure we will be looking at other packages that we will want to bring together in a total effort to help agriculture during this time. 
Let me say in my closing comments that our actions here on the floor have consequences. Every Senator who is on the floor now joined with us were active participants last Thursday when the Senate of the United States voted 98-0 to drop the sanctions against Pakistan and India. The Presiding Officer at this moment, the Senator from Kansas, led that dramatic effort to show that this country would stand united and not use food as a tool of foreign policy. 
Just moments ago the Senator from Kansas and I had calls from the Ambassador of Pakistan. They have tendered an offer now of over a 100-million-ton purchase from the United States. It is my understanding that they will make an effort at a nearly 300,000-tons purchase within the next several months. That is significant, and those tonnages will be purchased from the United States. 
Our actions here have consequences. If we want to be players in the world market, with and for our producers, we cannot throw up the artificial barrier of politics. We tore that down last Thursday in this instance, and the nations involved are responding. 
I thank my colleagues.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for just a few moments I would like to agree with the Senator from North Dakota on a couple of points that he just made. But I would also like to disagree with him on a few other points. 
He, like I, voted against the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, and we both voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement because we felt they were not properly negotiated. We felt both agreements had loopholes in them. The Senator from North Dakota has pointed out some of those loopholes. 
What we disagree on is the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is before us now which clearly outlines what a lot of farm and commodity groups in this country feel they need this Congress and this administration to do to improve the situation down on the farm. 
The Senator from North Dakota is right. The situation down on the farm is not very good right now. There are a lot of farmers losing money. But the Government should not dictate rules to farmers, and the Government should not be the total safety net. In a free enterprise system, such as ours, there should be an element of risk. In the 1996 FAIR Act, Congress have offered farmers flexibility along with that risk. Today, the Senate must decide how to shape that flexibility in a way to assure that farmers can make a safe transition to Freedom to Farm. This is where the Senator from North Dakota and I disagree. 
Yesterday I talked to the Governor of North Dakota, the president of the North Dakota Farm Bureau, and representatives from the North Dakota Wheat Growers. I left that meeting with the impression that these folks from North Dakota don't agree with the Senator from North Dakota either. They told me North Dakotans don't want to see Freedom to Farm reversed. They don't want Congress to lurch back into the failed policies of the past. They don't want the Government to be the largest provider of income to American agriculture, to be the one that holds the hand of the farmer and tells the farmer what to farm, how to farm, and when to farm. They agree that these choices ought to be made by the individual, as a free person in a free market. 
Now, Government has a role. The Senator from North Dakota is right when he states that the Government has not been fulfilling that role well. However, that role is not to be a safety net. It is not to be a caretaker. The proper role of the Government is to be the force which opens the door at the border. Government is to be a facilitator. 
I agree with the Senator from North Dakota on that point. Our negotiators ought to put jerseys when they go into trade talks. I want it to be Team America working for America and America's farmers. But I don't want a government check to be the sole source of income to America's farmers. Past administrations tried it and farmers became victims of an agricultural system design by Government. It did not work. 
Now agriculture is in transition. Times are not easy. And all of us are trying to sort out what can be done to help agriculture through that transition. But a step back into the past is not the route to take. I believe what the resolution before us today is exactly what American agriculture is looking for. 
What I want to know is why was this administration asleep at the switch for 12 long months while commodity prices slid and never used the tools Congress have given them to make a difference? Was it politics or was it simply ignorance of what was going on? Did they not know what they could do and what they should have been doing? 
What we heard from the commodity groups is very simple: Keep Freedom to Farm. Give us the flexibility and trade, trade, trade. They don't want crops stored on the farm--not for 1 year, not for 2 years, not for 3. They do not need a huge surplus hanging over the market. Let's move the grain. Let's sell the product. 
Yet, what has this administration done? They haven't used one tool to make a difference, and they don't know how to do it. That is what is frustrating to me.

Mr. CRAIG. I can't yield. We have a time limitation. Let me close, and then the Senator from North Dakota can speak if he wishes, because there is a lot that we agree on but there is also a lot that we disagree on. 
I do not want to look into the past. I want to look into the future. I want American agriculture to modernize and develop the flexibility that it ought to have. I want to help them when they need help. That is what we are on the floor discussing. 
The Senator from North Dakota talks about trade deficit. Trade deficits have occurred, and I do not like it either. But I have also watched our ability to trade expand with every agreement that we have struck. We know that in American agriculture today, if you don't sell 40 percent of the crop you raise in a foreign 
market, you are in trouble financially. That is why they are in trouble financially today--because this Government, this administration, this USDA, didn't help them sell the product at a time when markets were collapsing and other governments were aggressively pursuing those markets. 
So there are things we can do, but I hope this Senate will not step backwards into a dark age of government programs, farming controlled by Government, forcing farmers to live with a government check arriving in the mailbox as their only source of income. My farmers don't want that. Most farm groups don't want that. 
That is what this resolution is about--to craft a sense of the Senate in the area of trade, in the area that deals with taxes, to offer farmers the flexibility so that they won't be injured like they where when a Democrat controlled Congress in 1986 rolled back the ability of farmers to use income averaging. Congress ought not make those same mistakes again. I don't think we will. 
So let me conclude by saying this. There is a lot that the Senator from North Dakota and I agree on. We agree on the Government's inability to negotiate good trade agreements. Our trade negotiators need to be out there, working for agriculture. 
I voted yesterday and I will vote today and probably again next week for programs to help American agriculture out during this transition, but they have to be compatible with Freedom to Farm. We can't go back to all kinds of on-farm programs that store the wheat and store it and store it and store it for another year. Let's sell it, move it through the market, so we can get on with the business of transition. That is what I think this resolution represents. I hope the Senate will support it. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. CRAIG. Well, I would like to address that process and the actions of the New Mexico Environment Department for a moment. Mr. Chairman, it is my belief that the State of New Mexico is using an unprecedented process in issuing the RCRA Part B. If the current draft is finalized, the permit would require that each site which seeks to ship mixed waste to WIPP go through a modification of the Part B Permit. This could delay already stalled shipments from sites in New Mexico, Colorado and Idaho because of procedural impediments put in place by the State of New Mexico. This needless delay would likely cause the Department of Energy to violate their agreement regarding the disposal of nuclear waste from Idaho. Mr. Chairman, my point is this: The reason that the State of New Mexico is involved in this process is that the Environmental Protection Agency has delegated its authority over materials regulated by RCRA to the State of New Mexico. However, delegating authority does not, I believe, relieve EPA from its responsibility to ensure that the permitting of the WIPP facility is done within the intent of Congress in the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act and RCRA. As a matter of fact, it is tasked with ensuring that the State acts within the intent of federal law. Mr. Chairman, the Environmental Protection Agency has recently certified that WIPP can accept transuranic waste. However, it sits idly by as the State works to ensure that WIPP is not opened in a timely manner. The EPA should provide adequate oversight of the State of New Mexico to assure WIPP's timely opening.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Chairman on his leadership and hard work on his bill. He and the Subcommittee have had to make hard decisions about scarce resources and have labored to do so fairly. I also appreciate the Chairman's diligence in pursuing needed, aggressive oversight of some large agencies that, at times, have been sluggish in responding. He and the Subcommittee have made real efforts to make sure the taxpayer's hard-earned dollar is spent effectively and efficiently. I have seen first-hand, and appreciate, the Chairman's dedication to the integrity of this process. 
I request that the distinguished Chairman and I be permitted to engage in a colloquy. 
As the Chairman knows, the City of McCall, Idaho, is faced with the absolutely critical need to make significant improvements to its water system. McCall faces a potential cost of $6 million because of federal mandates for water purification. 
However, as much of 85 to 90 percent of these capital costs might be saved by installing a new, prototype, filtration technology. The City only recently received a proposal for a prototype filtration system. In what ought to be a prototype for voluntary private-public partnerships, the cost of research and development of the system would be borne by the contractor. 
That leaves the City with the need for $253,000 toward installation, start-up, and initial testing of the system. Through no fault on anyone's part, the proposal was not ready for the City to review, and could not be submitted to the Subcommittee, in time for consideration during the markup of this bill. 
I would ask the Chairman if he could work with us in conference to evaluate this request, with an eye toward inclusion in the conference report. 
This investment of $253,000 would not only save the community of McCall possibly more than $5 million, it would be a demonstration project that could help countless other communities, as well as the federal government, save millions of the taxpayers dollars in the future. I believe such a project would be consistent with the missions of either the EPA Science and Technology program or EPA State and Tribal Grants.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association does not represent the feeders. It represents the rank and file rancher, large and small, across our Nation. This letter says they oppose the amendment. It is very clearly, very clearly stated. 
We developed a futures market not only to look at current but future prices. Most of the livestock industry today effectively operates off of that and the market trends. 
Would I like to see more transparency? We all would like to see it. Does a government system and new government regulations dictating it cause it? The marketplace causes it. But this is a pilot program. Like it or not, it is new regulations in the process. 
As a former rancher, as a former cattle feeder, I will tell you this is a new set of Government regulations that may resolve the question for a very small number of operators. But for the industry itself--large, small, packer, feeder, producer, cow-calf operator--this is not for what they are asking. I don't believe it is the effective way to do it. I hope you would support a motion to table.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I congratulate Chairman Hatch for bringing the Senate this important reform measure to safeguard Americans' property rights. 
The concept of property is at the root of civilization as we know it. The right of the individual to acquire, possess and use property is one of the natural rights that does not depend on government for its existence; on the contrary, governments were formed in part to protect that right. Our Founders also saw the right to private property as the key to spurring individuals initiative and productivity that would ensure national prosperity and security. For that reason, the concept of property and the importance of its protection permeates the Constitution--there are references to it throughout the document, in addition to the fifth amendment's prohibition against the taking of private property for the public good, without just compensation. 
Unfortunately, however, all these rights aren't worth the paper they are printed on, unless they can be enforced. That principle applies even to the Constitution. Our Founding Fathers may have thought the fifth amendment would shield the people of this country from government taking their property without just compensation. But for all too many Americans the shield has no substance, the promise of protection is hollow, the Constitution's guarantee is an empty one--all because they cannot enforce it against government encroachment. 
This is not an isolated problem for a few wealthy Americans. In communities across the nation it is ruining family businesses, devaluing property of all kinds, preventing people from building homes and sometimes even from cleaning up pollution or hazards. In short, it is depriving citizens of all incomes from every state of one of the most prized basic human liberties. 
There are many aspects of the erosion of private property rights protection and many ways to attack the problem. Chairman Hatch and I and others have tried in the past to enact a comprehensive solution. Unfortunately, that effort ran headlong into another political agenda, and for that reason, we have put it aside for the near term. Meanwhile, however, it makes sense to push ahead on a more limited--but still important--part of the solution. 
The bill before us today, the Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998, focuses on the judicial side of the equation. Currently, people trying to vindicate their constitutionally guaranteed property rights face a procedural catch-22. They are forced to jump endless hurdles on the way to court, and then are bounced from court to court to obtain relief. At every step, the system is biased to the benefit of government and against the citizen. The costs are often staggering. 
If it were this difficult to enforce any other constitutional guarantee, we would have seen reform long ago. Even members of the judicial branch have acknowledged that clarification is seriously needed in this area. 
This bill would simplify the path to court and clarify the jurisdiction of the courts. It doesn't grant any new rights but only attempts to clean up the procedural quagmire that presently frustrates access to the courts. This is a precise and limited reform that would make a big difference to the citizens who are forced to litigate in order to protect their property rights. 
I know that local governments have been concerned that this legislation may interfere with their areas of jurisdiction. However, this bill does nothing to reduce the power of local governments to make decisions with regard to property. Furthermore, this legislation actually exempts localities from paying attorneys' fees if they lose a takings claim. If the case involves a critical question of state or local law that is unclear, that question will be sent back to a state court for decision before the federal case can continue. In short, the bill does nothing to take away power from state and local government, while it strengthens the protection of individual citizens' rights. 
Mr. President, the House has already passed similar legislation by an overwhelming vote. S. 2271 is an important reform, and I urge all Senators to support its passage. Let's most this bill to conference and then on to the President for enactment. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I am pleased to stand with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee today in support of S. 2271, the Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998. 
We can talk about constitutional rights, and we should; we can talk about the very basic foundation of our economy, and we must. All of us are in favor of the environment, but some like to put the rights of the collective over the right of the individual. 
What we are trying to do here today is sort a little bit of that out, because, yes, people buy property for a variety of reasons. They buy it to hold as you would put money in a bank, hoping that some day in the future you might be able to use it as an investment purpose to retire. It reminds me of a lady I met from Texas not long ago. She and her husband had done so. They had bought a small piece of property a long ways out of Dallas 30 years ago, hoping that some day it might be of value. 
All of a sudden, the suburbs of Dallas reached the property. Her husband is dead, and this is her retirement. The Federal Government, in cooperation with the municipal government, said that property can now not be developed for a multitude of reasons. This lady only can go to court to redeem her values, but in this instance, she has no money. 
While this particular legislation would not address that example, it would go a long ways toward honoring our constitutional rights and, most assuredly, would have allowed this individual her day in court. That is one example. 
In my State of Idaho, where there are people who have held property for generations and like to continue to hold them for a variety of reasons--ranching or farming because it is their livelihood--only to have the Federal Government step in and determine that certain uses may not go on on that land or certain practices--or the land itself may be habitat for a particular species of plant, animal or bird, the value of that property is diminished because of the flexibility that the individual has to manage and operate that property, not for investment purposes, but as an income property. Yet, in those instances, and in most instances, the opportunity to recoup those kinds of losses are denied. 
There are a good many other examples, Mr. President, and my time is limited this afternoon. I stand in strong support of this legislation and hope that my colleagues will join with me in gaining cloture for the purpose of debating this issue.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 107, a resolution affirming the United States' continued commitment to Taiwan. 
During his recent visit to China, the President undermined long-standing U.S. policy regarding Taiwan. President Clinton said, 
I had a chance to reiterate our Taiwan policy, which is that we don't support independent for Taiwan, or two Chinas, or one Taiwan-one China. And we don't believe that Taiwan should be a member of any organization for which statehood is a requirement. 
The President's statement, in fact, represents a long standing departure from U.S. policy. This statement represents an abandonment of a balanced policy that has allowed the United States to conduct important relations with both sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
The United States has not taken, and should not take, a policy position on the outcome of the dispute between China and Taiwan. Neither should we endorse or oppose Taiwan's independence or reunification. However, we must continue to insist that any eventual resolution of this dispute must come through peaceful means and with the approval of the people of Taiwan. The President's remarks are not consistent with that goal. 
Let us not forget that May 1998 marked the second anniversary of the first fully democratic Presidential election in the 5,000-year history of the Chinese people. That election occurred on the island of Taiwan. Taiwan has evolved into a modern, democratic society, a major economic power, and an active partner in world affairs. Taiwan's continued achievement should deepen the longstanding friendship between our two democracies. Should the President disregard that responsibility, the Congress must fill that void.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President let me thank my colleague and chairman, Senator McConnell, for working so closely with so many of us to bring S. 2282 to the floor. It is important that we act now and that we act decisively to send a very clear message to our producers and to our markets, both nationally and around the world, that we recognize, although sometimes the action of Government does not appear to, that the American economy and American farmers live in a global economy, 
and that we have to be a good deal more sensitive to our actions as it relates to that and the impact that those actions can have on our producers. Cutting ourselves off through unilateral sanctions seldom benefits us as a nation and almost always hurts the producer. In this instance today, we are speaking of that producer being the American farmer. 
Many of us have recognized that for a long time and have tried to say in a clear way through different pieces of legislation that food should never be used as a tool of foreign policy. But we stumble into that on a regular basis. As a result of that, we damage significantly the producer, because in the business of trade, one of the things that American agriculture has been able to establish over the years is two very important items. First of all, they are able to let the world know they can deliver a quality product. The world knows that and appreciates it. But it is also important that the world knows we are a reliable supplier. We search and we allow our producers to find markets and work to build those markets, only to be snuffed out by a piece of legislation that may or may not have impact upon another nation. That is exactly what has happened in this instance and why it is so important we act today and in a timely way. 
Food should never be used as a tool of foreign policy for all the reasons that have been spoken to by myself and Senator McConnell and I am sure will be referenced here today. It is poor policy to require the farmer to bear the burden of a faulty foreign policy or undeterminable goals, faulty goals. 
In the bill we passed a year and a half ago, a new farm bill, we made a variety of promises to American agriculture producers. We promised, as we eliminated most price supports and ushered in a greater freedom to produce, that we would help open up world markets and that we would assure their openness and access to those markets, and that would become an important part of the marketplace. We promised less government intervention, and we promised to improve risk management options. The tragedy is, while we promised it, the action that was necessary to be taken under the Arms Export Control Act was a denial of that promise. 
Today, we are here on the floor reinstating that promise very clearly. I hope the task force that Senator McConnell and others are involved in, while they have looked at this and while Senator Roberts has been a leader in helping us focus on this issue, that we go well beyond this in this future, that we examine all of the things we are doing in the area of sanctions to see whether they really make sense or not. Maybe they would have in a world economy if we were the sole provider, if we had something nobody else had, if we had something that everybody else needed; maybe then we could force policy that was otherwise unpopular with some. That is not the case, certainly not the case with agricultural commodities. We must be a supplier of quality, and we must be a reliable supplier. Government needs to stay out of the way, only to help facilitate access to those markets, not in any way to deter them. 
This amendment today moves us again to deal with this issue in a forthright manner. I think it will go a long way toward sending the right signal to our markets. I thank Senator McConnell and others who have been involved. 
He mentioned a good number who have been involved with us on a regular basis over the last several months, both Democrat and Republican, in focusing on this issue. I am happy to have played some role in it but, most importantly, to help get this to the floor on a timely basis so we can impact markets and production and price in this country. I am convinced this action today will do so. 
I yield back any remaining time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief, but I did want to recognize the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member for the tremendous work they have done on this bill to reform the IRS. Many of my colleagues have come to the floor today to speak about the reforms embodied in H.R. 2676. 
While the House moved very rapidly, the Senate engaged in a more deliberative process, appropriately, and reviewed in greater depth, in great detail, the changes we believed would be necessary. We did not want to make symbolic changes in the IRS, but wanted to change the very culture, the very thinking of the IRS, the way it functions, the way it treats the taxpayers of this country. 
I have been in the Congress of the United States now a few years. And not by my vote, but by the collective vote of past Congresses, we have seen the Internal Revenue Code expand and expand and become more complicated. And every time the government decided it needed more money, it hired more IRS agents. Control spending? No. Demand a leaner, more efficient bureaucracy? No. Review policies and repeal or reform uneconomic ones? No. Raise taxes and encourage the tax collector to squeeze the taxpayer harder--that was the way 40 years of liberal Congresses claimed they were addressing the fiscal problems of our country. 
So the IRS was an agency that Congress created and allowed to grow. And as the Tax Code became more complicated, the agency became larger, and by its very character it became a much more complicated and demanding agency. 
Times have changed. I believe we are able to bring about reform of the IRS today for a variety of reasons, not just because we discovered abuses, but also because this Congress is committed to downsizing, to right-sizing, Government. For the first time, we are talking, not about budget deficits, but about surpluses. For the first time, we are succeeding in our efforts to create a less intrusive IRS. In fact, we are talking about tax reform, not in some symbolic way, but fundamentally changing the way we tax the American people are asked to pay for the Government services and programs for which they ask. That is why we are able to be here today in a bipartisan mode, to talk about the changes that are embodied in this very, very significant document. 
So, I honor my chairman and ranking member here today, and my colleagues, who have stood forthright on this issue. When a citizen of our country, a taxpayer, receives a letter from the IRS, and it goes on the dinner table, with the family fearful to open it because they do not know what is inside, they are fearful there may be an audit announced, or that somehow they failed to comply with the code that is so complicated that they and their tax accountant, or even a tax attorney, cannot understand it. It is wrong for Americans to live in fear of their government like that. That bleak day is ending. The Congress well ought to have responded long ago to sense of dread on the part of American families. Some of us tried to. Because no American citizen, no taxpayer ought to fear their Government. 
Without question, taxpayers have feared the IRS. Some of that will now change as the reforms embodied in this conference report are implemented and become functional, and as they are carried out in the regulation and enforcement process. 
Two hundred twenty-two years ago, the American Revolution began, in large part, over an oppressive tax system. Today, for the first time in two hundred years, the Congress is taking significant power away from the tax collector and giving it back to the taxpayer. Today we reverse direction on a two hundred-year trend. Today we keep faith with the spirit that has been at the core American values and traditions from the start. Today, the Congress is taking long-overdue action to restore some of the liberty that an insatiable government has spent years eroding. 
But the day of change is not over, nor should it be. I, like others, believe we should move now to significantly change our country's Internal Revenue Code. The tax laws of our country should not be used for social engineering, nor should they be designed in such a way to tempt and enable legislators and bureaucrats to manipulate social policy in this country, to decide for the taxpayers what is good for them, and to use the tax code and the IRS to force them to behave accordingly. That impulse for social engineering, directed from a Washington, DC, that thought it was all-knowing, is what grew the tax code and gave the IRS its power. Decades of tax-and-spend Congress empowered and encouraged the tax collector to step outside the due process Americans expect in every other encounter with their government, and went about structuring social policy through tax law; and they gained power and they gained control. 
Today, we make a first step. This reform bill is an important symbol, but it is more than symbolic. It is the first installment on our commitment to do more. I believe if we restructure the tax code by reforming it in a significant way, by simplifying it and restoring a sense of freedom and fairness, we can come back to the very agency we are changing today and restructure it once again, because: As goes the code, so goes the character of the tax collector. 
So once again, I stand, like many of my colleagues do today, ready to vote for this conference report as a major first step in doing what the American taxpayer has said needs to be done for a long while and maybe lessening the fear that the taxpayer has of their Government and of the IRS just a little bit. 
I hope that we will return next year--in the very next year--not only to review the work we have done here but to reform the tax code in a more significant way and once again improve the tax collecting agency of our country, the Internal Revenue Service. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before I make comments on trade, let me only say to the Senator from Massachusetts, long before the Senate decided to put down the very ill-conceived piece of legislation, the Speaker of the House was saying that the House would address teenage smoking problems. So, whether the Senator from Massachusetts decides to characterize it today as a figleaf or Johnny-come-lately, that was clearly the intent of the House all along. Obviously, the Speaker is now honoring his commitment by stepping forward with a proposal. 
I hope in the end we can address this issue and not allow teenagers to be the figleaf of big taxes and big government, and find a real solution to this problem.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to talk today briefly about an issue that affects hundreds of American companies and tens of thousands of American workers, and that is, of course, the proper enforcement of the 1996 U.S./Canadian Softwood Lumber Agreement. 
On several occasions I have stood before this body to express disappointment at our trading partners who are violating trade agreements with the United States. Generally, the problem arises abroad and requires aggressive efforts by the administration to insist on compliance by other countries to ensure that our products and our workers can compete on a level playing field. But the foremost problem for the Lumber Agreement is action by the U.S. Customs Service that is affirmatively undermining the current softwood agreement that I am speaking to. 
As many of us who are from lumber-producing States are so keenly aware, the 1996 Lumber Agreement is our largest sectorial trade agreement with our largest trading partner, Canada. It is a very moderate response to a massive Canadian subsidizing of lumber. Unlike United States lumber mills which must buy timber at market prices, Canadian mills are provided timber by the Provinces at prices that are oftentimes one-quarter to one-third the market value of real timber on the stump. Those subsidies amount to $4 billion Canadian dollars a year. Subsidized imports have cost the United States thousands of jobs and have injured and constrained a pivotal U.S. industry. 
In 1991, Canada unilaterally abrogated a 1986 settlement of that dispute. Canada's imports to the United States climbed from about 27 percent of market share to almost 37 percent. The compromise in the 1996 Agreement was intended to offset, in part, Canada's subsidies and bring Canada's share of our market back to around 33 percent to 34 percent. 
In February of 1997, however, a ruling by our own Customs Service enabled Canadian producers to evade the agreement merely by drilling holes in the lumber. Let me repeat that--by simply drilling holes in a 2X4 or a building stud, ostensibly, the argument was, for wires and pipes in construction purposes. Customs said this lumber with a hole was `joinery or carpentry,' like doors or window frames or buil-up truss. This was a ridiculous ruling, by almost everybody's evaluation. It is inconsistent with other classifications. It is inconsistent with common commercial understanding. Official guidance issued by the Commerce Department, the International Trade Commission, and the Customs Service all confirmed that drilled lumber is `lumber' for import classification purposes, not joinery or carpentry. The U.S. Trade Representative confirmed that this product was intended to be covered by the Agreement. 
Not surprisingly, though, once Customs opened the door, imports of `joinery and carpentry' rose from about $8-10 million a month to nearly $46 million a month in April. This loophole is allowing over $1 million a day--let me repeat that--$1 million a day of subsidized lumber to evade the Agreement and destroy the Agreement's intent of offsetting the subsidy.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am here on the floor this afternoon to join my colleague from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, to reinforce what this Senate agreed to yesterday, agreed to in a unanimous environment. What they really agreed to, once the two Senators from Idaho and the Idaho congressional delegation had spent over 2 1/2 years ensuring that the public process was fulfilled, they agreed--you agreed, the Senate agreed--that the Senators from Idaho, having worked the process, deserved to do what was necessary to do to ensure the long-term stability of Mountain Home Air Force Base and its expanded mission. 
What did we do? What did Idaho do to ensure that the public lands were held in the appropriate esteem, that Native Americans involved in this were appropriately addressed, that the mission was fulfilled by the expansion of range to the necessary amount? 
We met twice with the BLM and the Air Force and all of the agencies involved to assure that they did their homework and that they did it right, because several years ago they had not done it right and Idahoans reacted, in part, by saying, while we need this training range, the process has to be corrected. The process is now complete and the process is correct, by every participant's evaluation. 
There are some, like Senator Kempthorne has just spoken to, who do not agree with it. But they agree with nothing. They oppose everything. Even though they are hard-pressed to admit that there were any failures to the process because they were involved, there were, I believe, some 16 public hearings in the State, a full outreach by the BLM and the Air Force, to make sure that this reallocating of land was the right thing to do. 
The Duck Valley Indian Reservation--I believe there were 20-plus meetings. Let me read a letter that was sent on January 29 by the entire congressional delegation to the Shoshone-Paiute tribes of Duck Valley Reservation. James Paiva, the tribal chairman: 
Dear Chairman Paiva: 
Today we received the Air Force's final Environmental Impact Statement . . . regarding the Enhanced Training in Idaho . . . project. We also had a meeting with senior Department of Defense, Air Force, Department of the Interior and Bureau of Land Management officials regarding the future steps necessary to develop the ETI. 
Knowing of the tribes' previous concerns regarding the ETI [or the Enhanced Training in Idaho] project, at our meeting today we especially asked about the tribes' position regarding the final EIS. We were assured the Air Force and BLM have made great efforts to accommodate the concerns of the Tribe. 
We want to thank you for your excellent cooperation on this very important project. We urge you to continue to work with the Air Force to develop cooperative solutions to training issues. We look forward to working with you in the future on the many areas of mutual interests we share. 
Sincerely,

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today with my friend and colleague from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, introduce a bill to amend the Idaho Admission Act of July 3, 1890, to provide for the better management of school lands within our state. In doing so, I note that our Idaho colleagues Congressmen Chenoweth and Crapo will offer identical legislation in the House of Representatives today. 
Mr. President, this piece of legislation is simple, straightforward, and of vital importance to my state. It brings federal statute into line with amendments to the Idaho Constitution passed by the Idaho State Legislature earlier this year and has but one goal: to bring about the better management of state lands to the financial benefit of our public schools. 
The legislation, along with that passed by the Legislature, were developed to implement the recommendations of a special committee of state leaders who sought to secure financial security for Idaho's schools. This legislation accomplishes the goal with only a few changes to current statute. 
First, it allows the Board of Land Commissioners to exercise its fiduciary responsibility as managers of the state endowments by treating both land and fiscal assets as one trust. 
Second, the proposal creates an earnings reserve account that will serve as a `shock absorber' to allow the endowments to provide a more predictable income stream. 
Third, it provides increased and stable funding for public education by allowing investments in assets that will provide higher rates of return. The state committee projected that through this single change, public education in our state could receive up to $20 million or more annually without raising taxes. 
Fourth, it establishes a land bank account for proceeds from the sale of endowment lands. The account gives the Board of Land Commissioners the flexibility to re-invest in other real property for the land trust. 
Mr. President, the legislation we introduce today is supported by the Idaho State Legislature and was written in compliance with the Joint Memorial passed by the Legislature and sent to us earlier this year. It is vitally important to our Governor, the Board of Land Commissioners, and all those involved in public education in our state. 
Like most western states, certain lands within Idaho were reserved for the benefit of public education upon admission to the Union. These lands are spread throughout the state and are managed for the financial benefit of our children. The Idaho Admission Act is very specific in how these lands are to be administered. And while these specifications worked well in 1890, they have now become outdated. These century old regulations have severely limited the state's efforts to maximize funding for public schools. The legislation we introduce today brings the management of endowment lands into modern times and employs modern financial tools to the benefits of Idaho children. 
Mr. President, I implore my colleagues to act on this measure in a timely matter and hope they might all join me in this important endeavor to help Idaho public education and the children it serves.

Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, first of all, I thank my colleague, Senator Kempthorne, for the tremendous diligence with which he has approached this issue for national defense and for the citizens of the State of Idaho. What we are talking about this evening in the amendment that we bring before you is an issue of national defense and the appropriate allocation of natural resources, natural public resources in our country. 
There is no question that it has been determined by the Air Force that Mountain Home Air Force Base needs additional capacity to train, to train the 366th Wing, the Composite Wing that my colleague has just spoken about--not only current training but future training. And of course out West, where the skies are blue and the horizons seem to be endless, you would think this would be an easy process. There is all of this public land. In fact, 63 percent of the State of Idaho is owned by the Federal Government. And you can just go anywhere and fly anywhere and train anywhere. That is not the case. We know that is not the case. And it should not be the case, because that public land is a valuable natural resources allocated for a variety of uses. 
It is most important that where the Air Force should train, that training should be specific, well defined, and that is exactly what we are attempting to do. The Senator has outlined the process--well over 2 1/2 years, 16 public hearings, thousands of inputs from the citizens of our State and from around the country for and against the expansion or the development of a new training range. We are now here, doing the necessary thing, and that is to reallocate public land, to take land which was once grazing land and wildlife habitat, but primarily used for grazing--it had been for well over 100 years --and saying no longer will this land be used for grazing, it will be used for training overflights. 
But for the person who grazed that land, the family who has had the right to graze that land under BLM permit for nearly 100 years, we are saying, `You will no longer be able to graze there. We are going to take that land away from your use. 
We are going to allocate a new area, and you are going to be able to gain a permit to graze in the new area under the standard prescriptions of the BLM and the range management set forth by the Secretary of the Interior and the appropriate rules and regulations of the National Environmental Policy Act.' As the Senator has just spoken, `You will be able to graze on your own range until such time as this agreement is worked out.' 
There is no special treatment. There is a recognition that in this process, we have two demands, and we ought to be able to meet both of them. We have the demand for expanded training range capability of the 366th, and we have what I think is a reasonable approach toward land use, and that is grazing. If we did not grant this rancher an opportunity to graze in other areas, we would destroy a 100-year-old family business and put them out of business. It is that plain, and it is that simple. 
The Air Force understood that, BLM understood that, the President understands that, and through this give-and-take and negotiations, we have arrived at a settlement. Not everybody agrees with that settlement, but everybody has been treated fairly. 
The Duck Valley Indian Reservation, Shoshone Paiute Tribe, Native Americans with substantial rights in that area have been treated fairly, have been allowed to be at the table to negotiate, as we should have treated them, and all considerations have been made--overflight levels not to disturb their solitude and the character of their lands, all the corridors of flight, all of those have been considered, because those pictures that the Senator just showed us show huge expanses of public lands and no fences and no lines and no roads. You would think, well, my goodness, fly anywhere. Not the case. There are land rights out there. There is private land, there is Indian land, and that is private by character of a separate nation, and there are private inholdings of citizens, and then, of course, there is the public land. 
There is a criticism launched that somehow this particular rancher that we are dislodging from an area where he and his father and his grandfather grazed for over 100 years is getting special treatment. That is not the case. What we are saying to him as we take away from him the land under which he grazed, therefore, if we didn't offer new land to graze, under the standards of the current law, somehow we would be denying him his livelihood. We are saying there will be costs involved in bringing the new range into quality--quality grazing, availability of water, fences for rest rotation grazing, and that rancher should not have to sustain those costs. So there are costs in transition. 
There are mitigating costs, and that is why we have worked hard; that is why Senator Kempthorne has worked especially hard on his committee to make all of these things happen. 
He twice--at least twice, maybe three times--has hosted meetings in his office that I have attended with all of the parties at the table to assure that everybody was talking and the fullest public process was met; that every `i' was dotted and every `t' was crossed under the National Environmental Policy Act to make sure that no stakeholder was left out. 
There are some California sheep, wild sheep in the area of concern. There is money in here for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game to monitor the character of that herd so that in no way do we damage the environment or the wildlife at hand. 
I think as a country, I hope that we as a Congress, have 
the ability to allocate resource and balance natural resource use and environmental needs along with our national defense. That is what this amendment does. It not only expands training range capability for Mountain Home Air Force Base and this new concept we call `composite wing,' but it assures long-term ability to do that kind of training. 
I say to my colleagues, you have just received a `Dear Colleague' letter from Senator Kempthorne and myself outlining the pros and cons of this. I must tell you that this is not without opposition. There are some who still prefer that nothing be done. But a majority of Idahoans believe something should be done, and certainly as those who are caretakers of the national defense--and that is what we as Senators are--it is important that we assure the long-term capability for our national defense and optimum training conditions for the men and women who fly the aircraft of our country. That is what we believe we are doing here. At the same time, we are assuring that the traditional and legally prescribed uses of our public lands for grazing purposes can continue to go on. 
I believe, Madam President, that what Senator Kempthorne and I offer tonight is a win-win proposition. The Air Force wins; American citizens win because of enhanced capability for national defense training; and our public land users and the environment win, because we are now expanding the capability of grazing by improving its conditions, and those grazing conditions also improve the conditions for wildlife because of additional water in areas where there may not currently be water and will be in the future. 
That is what we bring before you tonight. We appreciate your consideration of it. We hope you can agree with us, because, as Senator Kempthorne has said, the Idaho delegation stands united, along with the Governor of our State and our State legislature. We appreciate having a military presence in our State. We appreciate Mountain Home Air Force Base for what it does for the country, but also what it does for the State of Idaho. We also appreciate the beauty of the great expanse of our Federal lands. 
We also understand the importance of balanced and multiple uses. We think we bring all of those to the table in the amendment that we have offered, that the Senator has authored, and we hope that the Senate will concur with us in that amendment. I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sensed an effort to express a great deal of outrage here on the floor of the Senate this afternoon. I am outraged that there are a good number of folks who would like to hide behind the idea of teenage smoking to raise more taxes than this Senate will ever have raised with the sweep of one vote and to create more official bureaucracies in big government than we have ever created by one vote. That is exactly what you are tending to do. 
Let me tell you where the outrage is. It is outside the beltway. It is the average taxpaying citizen who says, `By golly, they figured out another way to do it. They balanced the budget. Now they will raise nearly $600 billion in taxes and they will create all kinds of bureaucracies.' 
And the latest polls--and they are not biased polls, they are taken across the board--say that this bill will not stop teenage smoking. Why? Because we don't go at it how you go at a teenager. I am all for making tobacco a controlled substance, and I think this Senate is. I want to get tobacco out of the hands of teenagers, and we ought to. We ought to do exactly what the States are doing. If you drink or you attempt to acquire liquor as a teenager, you lose your driver's license. 
But we are not saying that. We want to create great schemes; we want to raise hundreds of billions of dollars. I say, let's go get the tobacco companies, but let's talk the right talk about how we deal with teenage smoking. That is what the issue is here. 
I am all for pulling this bill down. Maybe we will come to our senses and craft something limited, something directed, and something relatively simple. And the American people will say: I believe they are serious. Right now, the American people are saying--that $30,000 and lower-income group--you are really laying it on us heavy. You are going to take it away from us and you are going to try to give it back? It doesn't make a lot of sense. Then again, for 4 weeks we have not made a lot of sense. We have postured politically, but we haven't done the right thing for America's teenagers.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as you have heard, current U.S. policy allows only encryption below the 56-bit key length to be sold abroad. For a long time now, software companies have argued that this level of encryption is so low it provides little security for the information being transmitted over the `super highway.' This policy also states that, in the production of encryption stronger than 56-bit, software companies must provide some type of `backdoor' access to ensure law enforcement can decode encrypted material. 
Addressing this from an economic perspective, customers--especially foreign customers--are unwilling to purchase American encryption products with backdoors and third-party access. This is particularly true since they can buy stronger encryption overseas from either foreign-owned companies or American owned companies on foreign soil without these invasive features.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the E-PRIVACY bill seeks to protect individual privacy, while at the same time addressing national security and law enforcement interests. It would also modernize export controls on commercial encryption products. 
The E-Privacy Act specifically addresses the concerns of law enforcement. First and foremost, it makes it a crime to intentionally use encryption to conceal incriminating communications or information. It also provides that with an official subpoena, existing wiretap authority can be used to obtain communications decryption keys/assistance from third parties.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Firearms Owner Privacy Act of 1998. This bill is aimed at safeguarding the privacy of law-abiding citizens who choose to purchase firearms and therefore undergo the instant background check mandated by the Brady Act. 
As many of my colleagues know, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is scheduled to go online on November 30, 1998. After that date, federally-licensed firearms dealers are required to contact NICS before they sell any handgun or long gun, so that a records check can be performed to determine whether the purchaser is prohibited by law from receiving the firearm. 
A unique identification number will be assigned by the NICS to each search request in order to identify the transaction. That number is to be kept by the dealer. However, if the sale is approved--that is, if the purchaser is not disqualified from purchasing the firearm--all other records pertaining to that sale are to be destroyed. 
This only makes sense. The Brady Act was never aimed at generating records concerning legal firearms sales. It was promoted as a law enforcement tool--a tool to prevent illegal gun sales and prosecute convicted felons or other disqualified persons who attempt to obtain firearms illegally. 
More important, Senators who participated in the debate on the Brady bill will remember the concerns that were raised about the federal government retaining records of approved, legal transactions. Simply put, keeping those records is tantamount to registering firearms--something that is far from acceptable to most Americans, not to mention most members of Congress and certainly to this Senator. The federal government has no legitimate reason for keeping track of which Americans own guns. On the contrary, history teaches us that gun registration schemes have been used to pave the way for gun confiscation. It is not unreasonable for citizens to be skeptical of the government's self-restraint--indeed, that is why our Founders built checks and balances into our system of government in the first place. 
In fashioning the Brady Act, Congress did not rely on government promises not to compile information on law-abiding gun purchasers. Instead, the law expressly prohibits the federal government from using NICS to establish any system for registering firearms, firearm owners, or transactions involving firearms. It also prevents a de facto registration system by specifically prohibiting the federal government from recording or keeping the records generated by the instant background check. 
Again and again during debate on this measure, members of the House and Senate raised concerns about the privacy interests of law-abiding citizens. Again and again, we were assured that these prohibitions would prevent the Brady Act from establishing or promoting any kind of gun registration for law-abiding citizens. Clearly, one of the keys to passing the Brady bill was the absolute assurance that the privacy of law-abiding citizens would be respected, and records of their firearms transactions would be destroyed. 
It is worth noting that since enactment of the Brady law, the concern over its potential for promoting gun registration has continued to boil. Like many of our colleagues, I continue to hear from people in my state and around the nation who do not believe this Administration--no friend to law-abiding gun owners--can resist the opportunity to mis-use and abuse the records generated during these background checks. 
Mr. President, the Administration just turned up the heat on those boiling fears. Now that we are within months of putting NICS on line, federal agencies are beginning to release the details of how the system is expected to work. My telephones are beginning to ring as firearms dealers, gun collectors, and sportspeople have an opportunity to read the fine print. Among the proposals that concern them the most is that the agency operating NICS intends to keep records of approved firearms transactions for eighteen months. 
That's right. The federal government proposes to keep records of legal, approved transactions for a year and a half. 
The agency has explained that it needs to keep the records for auditing purposes, to make sure the system is working properly and not being abused. Mr. President, why in the world do they need a year and a half for that purpose? Furthermore, the longer these records sit around, the more potential there is for abuse. How can the agency justify allowing its own administrative convenience to outweigh the serious privacy and civil liberties concerns raised against retaining such records? 
Let's not forget that under the current, interim system, records of an approved transaction are destroyed within twenty days. The NICS system is supposed to speed up the entire background check process so that the average contact will take minutes. Even if additional time is required because of problems with the check, the transaction is allowed to go forward within a mere three days, if the dealer does not receive a disapproval. The acceleration in every other part of the NICS system makes this records retention proposal even more incredible. 
I am wholly unconvinced that the agency has any legitimate purpose for retaining the records of lawful purchases by qualified citizens as it has proposed. The bill I am introducing today, the Firearms Owner Privacy Act of 1998, simply reinforces the decision that this Congress originally made on this critical issue. It would require information generated by the system on approved, lawful purchases to be destroyed within twenty-four hours. An individual who knowingly retained or transferred that information after that time would face criminal penalties of up to $250,000 or up to ten years' imprisonment. 
My bill also deals with transactions that are disapproved because a would-be purchaser is prohibited by federal or state law from receiving a firearm. For those transactions, the bill would permit the agency to retain the records for five years. If a criminal prosecution has been commenced against the purchaser, there would be no restriction at all on the agency's retention of the records. These provisions are aimed at insuring that if our law enforcement agencies intend to pursue a disapproved sale, they have ample opportunity to do so. However, the usefulness of these records past five years is very questionable. 
Mr. President, I believe my bill imposes reasonable, workable limits that conform to Congressional intent. If someone knows a legitimate reason why the federal government should keep these records longer than my bill allows, I am certainly willing to listen to their arguments. To date, however, the explanations from the Administration have been unpersuasive at best. 
Let me point out that a similar effort to limit the retention of these records is underway in the other body, headed by Representative Bob Barr. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort to protect the privacy and civil liberties of law-abiding citizens.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I certainly want to echo the statements of my colleagues from Kansas and Nebraska about the importance of dealing with our agricultural situation in this country. Last week, in my State of Idaho, wheat hit $1.90 as a result of the impact of the sanctions that are being imposed by this administration in reaction to laws that were passed by Congress a good number of years ago. 
I say this this morning to refocus us to understand that much of what we need to do is not getting done. Now, my colleagues on the other side, I have a feeling, would like to spend a lot more time on the tobacco issue. Somehow they think they are gaining points in the political arena that is warming up out there for many of our colleagues in the coming days through to November. I would like to suggest they look at the polling data of recent, that they talk with the American people just a little bit, that they ask teenagers in this country where the real problems are, and maybe they would agree with us that it is time we deal in some degree of finality with S. 1415, the tobacco bill. 
I know it is great politics, or at least many thought it was great politics, to be antitobacco, anti-teen smoking, and to raise a heck of a lot of money to do a lot of different things from the government level. It is important that this Congress be anti-teen smoking. It is important that we express our frustration and, if necessary, our anger with the tobacco companies on what they have done, and I think we can do that and should do that. But you do not do it by sucking the life out of lower-income Americans, raising taxes, shoving this commodity that we dislike into the black market and saying you have solved the problem by creating great new bureaucracies that we know will spend the money and get very little done. 
For the moment, let's do a reality check. We have been debating this bill now for upwards of 3 weeks. We have been adding a lot of amendments. Everybody has been pounding their chest on all of the good things we are going to do if we pass the bill. Here are the good things we have not done. Let me analyze for you the revenue flow over this multibillion-dollar bill.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to recognize one of my Idaho constituents, Kathy Wemhoff. With Flag Day quickly approaching on June 14th, I wanted to congratulate Kathy on being the Idaho state winner of The Citizens Flag Alliance Essay Contest. Kathy won a scholarship and went on to compete in the national competition. 
Her essay, titled, `The American Flag Protection Amendment: A Right of the People * * * The Right Thing to Do' focuses on the importance of the American flag to all citizens and discusses reasons why we should have a flag protection amendment. I think she has done an excellent job of making the case for protecting the flag, and I recommend her essay to every member of the Senate. 
I feel strongly about the protection of this flag. It is a beacon to us--a reminder of those who died for us and the values that unite us. As we near U.S. Flag Day, I'd like to remind the Senate of the already-proposed amendment to protect our flag and ask all my colleagues to support this important matter. Kathy's feelings are shared by most Americans. Let's not ignore them. Let's support them and build our nation's pride! Let me now read Kathy's essay:  
The American Flag Protection Amendment: A Right of the People * * * The Right Thing To Do 
I pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the United States of American. . .' Every day, millions of voices speak these words first published in `Youth's Companion' on September 8, 1892: voices belonging to the men of the armed forces, school children, and the citizens of the United States of America. The pledge, written for the National Public Schools Celebration of Columbus Day, became enormously popular in a very short time. On Columbus Day of that year, only one month after its publication, more than twelve million school children took the pledge (Quaife 154). The birth of the pledge and its enormous success demonstrate the importance that the American populace place on the flag. 
The pledge must hold some special meaning for such a great number of people to believe and repeat these words daily. No words could be clearer than those of the Pledge of Allegiance. Every man, woman, and child who repeats the words not only understands them, but also lives by them. The people are voicing their loyalty to and belief in the nation and its flag as they put their hands to their hearts. Even centuries after the nation's establishment, the flag remains a symbol of the United States and the freedom of the people who reside within. 
Symbols have substantial importance in this world, but what exactly is a symbol? A symbol may be an object or idea which suggests some other more distinguished idea by reason of relationship, association, or convention. A Christmas tree or stockings, for example, are symbols heavily depended upon by most people. Few can imagine Christmas without a tree or stockings. The symbol relates the person to that event or object which would otherwise seem unimportant. Without the flag to represent the dedication, honor, and freedom of the United States, we the people will lose our faith in the country. The flag reminds the citizens of their freedom and the soldiers who fought and died for that freedom. The flag, so admirable fluttering in the air, must be preserved from the elements and protected from desecration. The thought of the flag torn and dirtied by carelessness or hatred turns the stomachs of the people who look to the flag with admiration. Not only can this behavior be labeled unjust to the flag, but also to the country and all its people. The need for a law to protect the flag from inequitable harm has arisen, for the flag is relied upon as the national symbol of freedom. 
Old Glory, millions of times unraveled and sewn again since Independence Day, July 4, 1776, remains for the most part preserved and protected throughout the country (Quaife 109). People young and old care for the flag as if it were a delicate vase shielded from all harm for many centuries, carrying it in from the rain, never letting it touch the ground, and even guarding it with rifles. When the flag rises, American citizens young and old stand and salute it to show their respect for what it represents: honor, nobility, and the individual soldiers who fought for our freedoms: of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (Berkin 425). These freedoms are extremely important, yet often taken advantage of. 
There remains an exception to the behavior that most possess around the flag; people may desecrate it without punishment. No law exists at this time to protect the flag from ill treatment. Those who desire to fight in the flag's honor can do so by joining forces with all our nations' people and fighting for the creation of a law to protect and preserve it. The Constitution and laws of the country are made by the people, and for the people; therefore, the people have the right to fight for the protection of the American flag. Not a law of one town or of one state, but a law of the nation should be created: an amendment to the United States Constitution guarding against desecration of our nation's symbol of freedom. 
The American Flag remains protected from `disloyal utterances' by the Sedition Act, passed in 1918, but holds no personal amendment or act to prevent it from being physically damaged (Berkin 425). An amendment with strength will uphold the credibility of the flag, saving it the humility of desecration or desertion. A simple and unadorned, yet specifically detailed amendment will hold anyone disrespectful to the flag's rights in contempt of the nation. Any purposeful act of aggression against the flag, such as dragging it in the dirt or burning it, would result in heavy punishment. The guidelines of what exactly would be punishable would be stated in the Flag Amendment; the Supreme Court would have the authority to enforce punishment when these laws were violated. 
A decision of the court may be based upon much of the same facts as was the case `United States vs. O'Brien, 1968' when four young men burned their draft cards in protest of the Vietnam War. The O'Brien case dealt with the issue of symbolic speech, whether or not certain actions should be allowed to fall under the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech (McClenaghan 118). Burning a flag or desecrating one in any other manner would follow the court ruling of the O'Brien case; a limitless variety of conduct cannot be labeled `speech'; therefore, unacceptable behavior toward the flag can be punishable by law. The flag, protected by the First Amendment under symbolic speech, would then also have an amendment that described the limits of what behavior would be acceptable in its handling and what punishment could be given in the event of its desecration. 
The flag, for so many reasons, deserves and needs protection from desecration and misuse. Since the majority of the nation's people view the flag as a symbol of their freedom, it deserves an amendment to recognize and protect it. The need for this amendment exists because of the few people of the nation who cannot respect the flag or look to it as a symbol of their freedom. All citizens should support the cause of creating an amendment to protect the flag from dishonor. It is of great importance to have a symbol of the nation's freedom and unity so that the people do not forget or take advantage of the rights they possess by living in America.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am so pleased to be able to stand on the floor today with my colleague from Georgia who is the primary author of the important amendment that is before the Senate. He has done such an excellent job of laying out what everyone in America knows to be the No. 1 issue facing our young people and literally facing the American culture, and that is the drug culture and the impact it is having on the lives of an awful lot of our citizens and especially our young people. 
Neither he nor I belittle the concern that 3,000 young Americans start smoking every day. But 3,000 young Americans that start smoking don't die every day. But about 40 of our youngest and sometimes our brightest die every day because of an overdose of drugs or because of a crossfire of a gang shooting that was drug-related. That adds up to about 14,000 young Americans. 
Yet this legislation we have before us, S. 1415, 753 pages that our colleagues tell us will cause young citizens in this country to smoke less and live a better life, has not one word in it about illicit drugs, the drug traffic, and what we as a citizenry and those of us as policymakers ought to be doing, where we can, to stop the rapidly increasing flow of illicit drugs into this culture. 
My colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, and I join together. By this amendment we are saying if you are really sincerely concerned about what goes on amongst our young folks today that may in some way damage them, then you ought to be voting for this legislation because the Senator from Georgia, like myself, and I know like the Presiding Officer at this moment, have on many occasions gone before grade school and high school groups to talk about the state of affairs of our country and the importance to those young people of what goes on in our country, and we have asked the question, Is cigarette smoking a problem. Yes, a few hands go up. They are concerned about it. Others are not because they are smoking. But when you ask about drugs, when you ask about the character of them, the nature of them, the availability of them, all hands go up, or nearly all hands, because young people know better than anyone else what is going on amongst their peer group. They are frighteningly concerned because oftentimes it impacts the life of a friend or it disrupts in a massive way a friend's family. 
Yet today this Senate is silent on the issue. This administration has retreated in a dramatic way from the war on drugs that was launched by the administrations of President Reagan and President Bush. 
Let me give some very interesting statistics. While there are not as many pot smokers as tobacco smokers at current rates, if the current rate continues, in but a few short years there will be almost as many marijuana, pot, weed smokers amongst our youth as there are tobacco smokers. There has been a 25 percent, 38 percent, and 31 percent increase in the number of children who have smoked a cigarette in the last 30 days, in the month of May. In comparison, there has been 175, 153 and a 99 percent increase, respectively, in the number of children who have tried a joint of marijuana in the last 30 days in the 8th, 10th and 12th grades, respectively. 
That is an American tragedy. We know it. Yet, we have allowed this administration and, frankly, we have allowed the Congress to be relatively silent on the issue. That is why the Senator from Georgia and I could be silent no longer. It is critically important that we speak out, that we begin to shape more clearly policy that will work toward interdiction. As the Senator has just spoken to, the Coast Guard, dramatically cut back, with ships in mothballs--they are not out in the Gulf of Mexico, where they were for a good number of years, stopping the flow of illicit drugs moving into the market. 
There is a 70 percent flow of drugs coming across our southern borders, and we are silent to it. Well, yes, in all honesty, there has been a limited amount of interdiction. Yes, there was an effort on the part of this administration as it related to the money laundering in Mexican banks. But just the other night, on television, there was attention addressed to three Mexican brothers operating south of the border, in Tijuana, talking about the multihundreds of millions of dollars in cash-flow and the intimidation and the deaths that they can bring down on citizens who get in their way because they are the kings of drugs flowing up the west coast. We know who they are. Their pictures were shown on television. But we do limited amounts of things against them. Are we frightened of them? No. It is just a retreat from the scene. It is the attitude of, well, we will fund a little bit of therapy if somebody gets hooked on drugs. But somehow we don't want to engage in a war to save our children. 
I was once a smoker. I am not proud of it, but I was. But I quit, I guess when I matured enough to know that it wasn't good for me and smart enough to know that it wasn't the right thing to do. But you know, if I would have been hooked on a major drug like cocaine, I might not be here today. The great tragedy of young people and drugs is that it kills them. Young people, while smoking cigarettes may be the cool and stylish thing to do amongst their peers, grow up and mature. There is a reverse peer pressure that begins to develop, and in great numbers we see young people quitting in their twenties and early thirties. They can quit because they are not dead. But if they are hooked on cocaine or heroin, which is the follow-up to marijuana, they are dead. That is how they quit. We know it. 
We saw the great tragedy out in California of the great humorist a few weeks ago whose wife could not get off cocaine. She finally killed that humorist and then took her own life and left two small children. That is the story of drugs, the tragedy of drugs. The other side is saying that we have a bitter pill here: We are trying to destroy a tobacco bill. Quite the opposite: We are trying to make it a good piece of legislation that truly does something against this phenomenal drug culture in our society. That is what we ought to be debating. Those are the real issues. 
Let me give you some fascinating statistics. Young people are young people, and for those of us who are now adults, but, more importantly, for those of us who have raised teenagers, we know a lot more about kids than we used to know, especially if we have raised our own. We know that if you put a challenge against them, oftentimes they will meet the challenge. Well, guess what? The American public knows that, too. And so when they were recently asked, just in the last week, in a nationwide survey--not funded by a tobacco company, funded privately--the question was asked: Which of the following do you believe 
is the most responsible for young people initially beginning to smoke? Ten percent of the American public said Hollywood, television, popular culture. 
You know, it is true. When that handsome or attractive television star or movie star walks out in prime time with a cigarette in their hand, that is cool; that is something, those viewing say, I ought to do. Yes, when President Clinton said he didn't inhale and then later on MTV he jokingly said he might have on a second try, guess what happened? Marijuana usage amongst teenagers bottomed out and headed up, because the leader, the icon of America's culture, kind of shrugged it off as no big deal. But the tragedy of no big deal is that, step one, marijuana smoking leads to step two, a search for cocaine, which can lead to death. The numbers have dramatically changed during this administration. I am amazed that they aren't out on the front line with us attempting to lead a war against drugs. 
Well, back to the question: Who most influences young people to initially start smoking? Thirteen percent say the parent example--in other words, a power figure, an important figure in your life. If your parents smoke, you are likely to smoke. 
The tobacco industry and their advertising--if you listened to the debate from the other side on the floor, you would be convinced that they alone caused 3,000 kids a day to start smoking. The American public says that maybe 6 percent of the cause is laid at the feet of the tobacco companies. I am not going to let the tobacco companies off. Yes, we now know that they targeted young people by their advertising, and that is wrong, and we ought to try to stop that. But the public knows that it didn't work that much. 
Guess what. No. 1 factor: 59 percent say influence of peers and friends. If you have ever raised a teenager, you know that that is absolutely correct. It is the pressure of those whom they associate with, those whom they go to school with, those whom they play with; that is the real influence. If the friend is smoking, then there is a great pressure for you to smoke. Worst of all, if the friend is using drugs and thinks it is cool, and you are in that group, as a teenager, there is phenomenal pressure on you to go along, to be cool, to be part of the crowd. 
Well, the statistics go on. But, most importantly, the American public has not been fooled by the rhetoric on the floor from the other side that somehow this massive tax increase, this massive expansion of Government programs, is somehow going to stop teenagers from smoking and make the world a safer and healthier place, because when they were asked, in this same poll, basically what the impact of this legislation would do and what it really was, 57 percent of them said it was a massive tax increase and a major increase in Government. And then they asked the question about raising the price of a pack of cigarettes by better than double--$2.50 when everything is added in at the furthest extension of the bill--is that more likely or less likely to stop teenagers from smoking? 
Sixty-seven percent of Americans said it was less likely. Strangely enough, Mr. President, if you do the math and you raise cigarettes to that amount, all of a sudden marijuana becomes less expensive in a relative sense. Kids are paying three times or four times the price of tobacco for a joint of marijuana. Yet, we are being told that if you just jack up the price somehow they quit smoking. Yet, marijuana usage in a 30-day period in this last month of May was up 157 percent amongst eighth graders. It sounds like a lot of spendable income to me. Yet, that is not taken into consideration. 
So my colleague from Georgia and I said that somehow we have to change this. We have to work with our colleagues here in the Senate to change it. How long can we go with these figures and statistics and death rates smacking us in the face and saying it is not a problem, it is not a problem if 14,000 young people die directly or indirectly related to drugs on an annual basis? That is a national crisis by any definition deserving a national effort of magnitude against it. That is what the Coverdell-Craig amendment does. 
As my colleague from Georgia was speaking and talked about doubling the interdiction budget for U.S. Customs, doubling the interdiction budget for the Coast Guard--in other words, ships out of mothballs and back in the water--the Department of Defense put some effort there because they have been pulled back. As my colleague from the State of Idaho who is chairing at this moment knows, we have seen a major effort out in our State with drug-free communities and a drug-free neighborhood effort. We help there. While that has been a marvelously successful voluntary effort bringing in business and educators in our State, we help them out by some block grants giving flexibility to do more in the local communities by millions of dollars nationwide to encourage the successes in Idaho and other communities to have those successes across the board everywhere. Does it make a difference if national leaders and local leaders and State leaders are standing up telling their young people not to get involved in drugs? You bet it does. Our First Lady, Nancy Reagan, was oftentimes joked about because she said `just say no.' Yet, because she was and is a national leader and a national image of great respect, the young people responded. 
There is value in saying no and not shrugging it off and laughing and saying, `Maybe I ought to have tried to inhale.' But it is very important that leaders of this country say no. 
Our legislation helps leaders at the local level and the State level say no. Why should teenagers convicted of drug crimes or associated with drug purchases have a driver's license? If you are caught drinking at an illegal age in the State of Idaho, you don't have a driver's license. Shouldn't it be the same? Our bill provides for that incentive, and it ought to. 
But the real arena is our schools. This legislation makes allowable the use of Federal funds to provide school choice for grades K through 12 for students who are victims of school violence related to drugs, and includes drug-related crimes, creates incentives for States to provide an annual report card for parents and teachers listing incidents of crime. In other words, it lifts the awareness of drugs in the community and in the school system to get parents involved along with their educators to build a drug-free school environment. That is what we ought to be talking about--and a smoke-free environment. 
Let me add that. That is important, too, because we want to get kids away from tobacco. 
The thing I fear most in all of what we do or may not do is that we are hiding in the myth that has been perpetrated by some, including the former Director of the Food and Drug Administration, that if you just jack up the price of a pack of cigarettes the problem goes away. Yet, every nation that has tried that in the past--and Canada is a perfect example--lost their market because the market went into the black market. When there is a desire in the public arena for something and you restrict the ability of the public to get to it, they will find a way. Thirty percent of the sales in Canada went into the black market. They had to lower the tax to get the sales back to control the product. 
My point is very simple. If we do that in this country and 30 to 40 percent of tobacco and cigarette sales move into the black market, then that cool dude on the street that is selling your kids marijuana or cocaine is going to open his coat and say, `Oh, you can have some cigarettes, too. I am your local cigarette vendor, but I also have marijuana and cocaine. What is your choice?' Wouldn't that be a human tragedy if that is what this legislation, S. 1415, results in? 
I am not saying that is the intent. I am saying that is how the market reacts. The statistics and facts show that in Canada, in Europe, and in Germany, that is exactly what happened. Yet, we are so naive to think you just jack up the price as high as you can possibly get it. Oh, sure, you are going to get hundreds of billions of dollars from the lower income, 30 percent of the socioeconomic scale of this country, and you are going to spend that in all kinds of programs. The trial lawyers are all going to get billions of dollars. But what about the kids? What about the kids? 
You can't tell the tobacco industry to quit advertising without their consent. It is something called the first amendment in our country. They said they would voluntarily do that if we would control this a little bit. This Senate has chosen not to do so. So we will not get their consent. They will not become involved. But the great tragedy is our kids will be the victims still. While it may curb a few of them from smoking, we are silent--deathly silent--to the issue of drugs. 
I am extremely proud to stand on the floor today with my colleague from Georgia to offer the most comprehensive anti-teen-drug amendment, to my knowledge, that this Senate has put forward. I don't plead with my colleagues from the other side. I challenge them to get aboard, to quit looking at the dollars and the political game being played, and come with us into good, effective public policy that mans the front lines once again in the war against drugs, that allows national leadership and State and community leadership to unite to say that perpetuating a drug culture among teenagers of our country is an evil we will not tolerate. That is what our amendment does so very clearly. 
So to the other side, don't call it a bitter pill. How dare you? I don't blame you for being embarrassed about the President's record. The country ought to be. But we don't have to live with that record. We can walk beyond it. This amendment allows that to happen. This is not a bitter pill, nor is it a placebo. It is the beginning of a major and comprehensive effort to deal with the reality of our time. That is that there is the growth of a drug culture in our society that is killing America's youth in greater numbers than we ever dreamed possible. It is time that we stop it.

Mr. CRAIG. The last 30 days, 8th, 10th, 12th graders, using marijuana, up on the average of 100 percent. That is a dramatic figure that you speak to. 
Out in my State of Idaho--rural, big public land State--two major raids last year of huge magnitude, to interdict marijuana, and still it remains, by everybody's figures--and we don't have those figures--the No. 1 cash crop in this country being driven by this huge market in this country. And that is in this country. And we are not getting that, let alone getting the huge flow of cocaine and heroin coming in from the outside along with marijuana, 70 percent of the flow across our southern borders. 
The Senator from Georgia dealt with that with greater money for Border Patrol and interdiction. When we look at what is going on in Mexico today and their attitude in relation to this, it is a huge money machine for them, and it permeates down through their system, and it corrupts it. And it will corrupt ours, because there is the constant effort to corrupt. So that those who are of the profiteers can gain access through to the innocent, the children. 
I thank my colleague from Georgia for his effort and his energy in this area. He brought my attention to this issue, and it was obvious to me in a very short time that we had to deal with this. We will be back, successful or unsuccessful here. This is something I think neither of us will rest on until we have a much clearer, stronger public policy in this area and we engage our Government in probably one of the most significant wars--against our very culture and our people, our young people, our future--that we have ever seen before. 
I thank my colleague, and I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased that the time has come for the Senate to begin debate on a portion of the legislation before us that I think, if accepted by this body, will be the most significant thing that we can possibly do. 
Mr. President, even before the bill before us was brought to the floor of the Senate, the question of tobacco has been, for many months, one of the major issues of public debate, if not the major issue in some quarters. 
The Clinton administration, in particular, has crusaded for legislation supposedly aimed at preventing America's teens from taking up a deadly habit, arguing that the need for this legislation is so strong that questions of cost and constitutionality, or the ordering of social priorities, are left by the wayside. Even raising such questions is to invite the accusation of being a tool of the big tobacco companies. How dare you stand in the way of this legislation. 
Not long ago, Mr. President, I was in Idaho speaking to a group of high school students. This was just as the tobacco issue was starting to break out at the top of most news stories. I asked these kids what the biggest problem facing them and their peers was and what that problem was doing to their lives. When I mentioned tobacco, I'll be honest with you, I was a bit surprised. I was surprised that a lot of hands didn't go up because that is what the media had been talking about, what the front pages were telling us. In fact, Mr. President, only a few hands went up. But when I asked about illegal drugs, almost every hand went up. There was hardly a young person in any one of those high school groups that I spoke to that didn't see drugs as a major problem. 
Mr. President, you come from a relatively rural State, as do I, and, remember, teenage drug abuse is supposed to be a problem of the big inner-city schools. But the school I was talking to was a school of 250 in rural Idaho. Yet, nearly every hand went up because every one of those students knew someone in their age group who was misusing or was involved in illegal drugs, and they were concerned about that young person's future. They were concerned about the effect it would have on their friends' lives. Well, someone might say that these are kids, what do they know? We are the adults; we are the United States Senators, and we are supposed to have a more mature view of the problems that face the citizens of our country. Yes, I would hope that we as adults would be able to make mature and 
considered judgments on these questions. But in sensing that drugs present a bigger threat to them now than does tobacco, I think these kids are right. Yes, we should do everything reasonable that we can possibly do to discourage young people from taking up smoking. 
I was once a smoker myself, and I know that it is not easy to quit. I fought it hard and I fought it for a long time. And I haven't smoked in 8 years. I am proud of that and so is my family. But if these kids do start smoking, the real danger they will face will be 10 and 20 and 25 years out, before which let us hope they mature, that they have a reason to think about their life and their health, and they quit like I did, and they become parents who discourage their children from smoking. 
Smoking may kill teens later in life, but illegal drugs are killing them today. Whether we are talking about overdoses, car accidents, or the violence associated with the drug trade, illegal drugs present a clear and immediate danger to every young person who tries them, to their families, and to their communities. Talk to the parents of a child they have just lost to an overdose of drugs, and they didn't realize until it was too late that their child was on drugs. No family, no socioeconomic family in every strata, or at any level, is immune. Not one kid will likely die this year because he or she lit their first cigarette. But thousands of Americans will die because they started using drugs this year. Kids who started using drugs today may not get a chance to mature out of that habit, as I did and as thousands do. 
I expect there are very few parents who would not care whether their kids decided to start smoking. Most of them care a great deal. However, if they were asked whether they would be more concerned about their teens starting to smoke or becoming a user of marijuana, crack, or heroin, how many parents would say they would take the dope over tobacco? Well, we know what they say. We have seen it in the polling. Let me tell you, Mr. President, the polling is dramatic. The polling is very clear. The parents of today in the highest of percentages say, Get the drugs away from our kids. It is the No. 2 issue. And way down at the bottom of all of those issues that parents are concerned about, as it relates to their kids, is smoking. Yet for the last 2 weeks, this Senate has been focused on that issue. Why? Because it is politically popular. We are going to bash those big tobacco companies because they lied to the American people, and we are going to save teenagers from smoking, and we are going to raise taxes to an all-time high to do it. We are going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet, No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, in any poll you take, on the average parent's mind today is the kids associated with drugs, the kids associated with gangs, the kids being killed in car accidents; and way down at the bottom, but on the list of 10 or 12 items, is smoking. 
That is one reason I question the administration's priorities tonight. In the abstract, I suppose that if drug use continued at the steady decline of the `just say no' Reagan and Bush era, if we could honestly say we had the drug dealers on the run, we might start to ask, Well, what is the next thing on the list of national priorities that this Congress ought to become involved in? 
But that is not what we see. The drug policy of the Clinton administration has been by every measure except theirs a miserable failure. From an early slashing of the funding for the White House antidrug office, to the administration's effort to have it both ways on clean needles for addicts, to their effort to lower penalties for crack cocaine to equal those of powder, to the President's grossly irresponsible `I wish I had inhaled' comment on MTV, this administration has sent all the wrong signals. And guess what? Those signals have been picked up by the young people of this country, and the predictable results have occurred. 
Two national annual surveys show that drug abuse by our Nation's youth has increased steadily since the Clinton administration came into office. 
The University of Michigan December 1997 Monitoring the Future Study, and the 1997 Parents Resource Institute for Drug Education, and the so-called PRIDE Survey each offer cause for alarm. 
The Monitoring the Future Study reveals that illicit drug use among America's schoolchildren has constantly increased throughout the Clinton administration. 
Mr. President, here comes the figures of alarming proportion. 
For eighth graders the portion using any illegal drug in the prior 12 months has increased 71 percent since the year President Clinton was first elected. And since 1992, it has increased 89 percent amongst 10th graders, and 57 percent amongst 12th graders. That is any illicit drug. The numbers go straight through the roof since President Clinton came to office. Reagan, Bush--numbers declining. Everybody laughed at Nancy Reagan when she said `Just say no.' But she stood on a moral pedestal along with George Bush and Ronald Reagan, and they stood as powerful leaders and examples. We have a President who chuckled, and said, `Well, I wish I had inhaled.' Sorry, Mr. President. You sent all the wrong signals. 
Marijuana use accounted for much of the overall increase in illicit drug use continuing its strong resurgence amongst eighth graders. Use in the prior 12 months has increased 146 percent since 1992. 
The year President Clinton was first elected to office, amongst 10th graders, the annual prevalence has increased 129 percent amongst 12th graders it has increased 76 percent since 1992. 
Those ought to be figures that are spread in banner headlines in every major newspaper in this country. And they go unnoticed except in our schools, except with school administrators and counselors, and most importantly with parents, who say it is the No. 1 issue facing their children and them as parents. 
Of particular concern, according to the survey, is the continuing rise in daily marijuana use amongst 10th and 12th graders. More than one in every 25 of today's high school seniors is a current daily marijuana user, with an 18.4-percent increase since only last year, while only 1.1 percent of eighth graders used marijuana daily in 1997. That still represents a 50-percent increase since 1992. 
Since President Clinton was first elected, annual LSD use has increased over 52 percent, 68 percent, and 50 percent amongst 8th graders and 10th graders and 12th graders, respectively. More than one in 20 seniors in the class of 1997 
used cocaine this year, a 12.2-percent increase over just last year. That is cocaine. That is the drug that kills. Crack cocaine also continued a gradual upward climb amongst 10th and 12th graders. In short, since 1992, annual cocaine use is up 87 percent, 147 percent, and 77 percent amongst 8th, 10th and 12th graders, respectively. 
The longer term gradual rise in the use of amphetamine stimulants also continued within the class of 1997, increasing over 7 percent since last year. Since 1992, annual heroin usage--heroin is on the resurgence--has increased by 83 percent, 141 percent, and 92 percent for 8th, 10th, and 12th graders. 
America, these are our kids, and they are using heroin. This administration doesn't talk about it. 
The most recent PRIDE Survey shows a continuing and alarming increase in drug abuse amongst young kids. Illegal drug use amongst 11- and 14-year-olds has continued on a dangerous upward spiral. 
According to the president of PRIDE, senior high drug use may have stalled, but it is stalled at the highest levels that PRIDE has measured in 10 years.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for that modification. It does clarify an important point. 
Mr. President, according to PRIDE--those are the folks out there on the front line trying to stop kids from using drugs--senior high school use may have stalled, but it has stalled at the highest level PRIDE has measured in 10 years. 
Until we see sharp declines in the use at all grade levels there will be no reason to rejoice. 
With respect to young students, the survey found a full 11 percent of junior high students--that is grades 6 through 8--are monthly users of illegal drugs. Junior high students reported significant increases in monthly use of marijuana, cocaine, uppers, downers, hallucinogens, and heroin especially. 
Can you imagine that, Mr. President? We are talking about junior high kids. Heroin, drug of choice? 
Annual marijuana use has increased 153 percent since Mr. Clinton first took office. Cocaine use is up 88 percent. 
Why aren't we spending weeks on the floor of the Senate debating this, because it is the No. 1 issue amongst parents. The kids know it. They know their friends are being killed by it. They are laughing at the fact that they think we are going to legislate them away from tobacco. 
Hallucinogen use has increased 67 percent since Mr. Clinton took office. 
Now, in the face of this clear and present danger to our Nation's youth, how can this administration justify their obsession with tobacco? That is because there are 100 groups lined up to help them. It is a popular political issue. I agree with them on the premise. But I think they missed the point. They missed the point that the young people of America are talking about. They might answer. `Well, teen rates of smoking are also going up.' That is true. But if we look at the facts on teen tobacco use, also found in the Monitoring of the Future Report that I have been quoting, we see the same pattern as on drug use--a steady decline in the Reagan-Bush years with a steady climb since 1992. In other words, what our President says to America and America's youth counts. When he makes light of his flirtation with marijuana, they make light of it, too. That is a great tragedy. 
Let us ask the question: Instead of hiking increases in teen smoking to justify massive, intrusive, expensive legislation that will mostly target adult smokers, shouldn't the administration admit that teen smoking increase is yet another symptom of their failed drug policy? Shouldn't they admit that having given kids a wink and a nod on drugs, other bad habits would also appear more acceptable? Anybody who has raised teenagers knows that. 
Let's take a concrete example. Recently, an article appeared in the New York Times. `Young Blacks Link Tobacco Use to Marijuana.' Strange relationship. I am quoting the New York Times relating to a dramatic increase in tobacco use amongst minority teenagers. According to this article, experts believe that part of the explanation for increased tobacco use amongst these teens is because they are already using marijuana. 
And that tobacco prolongs the effect of marijuana smoking. If so--and I recognize that there are certain complex factors here--this is a case where tobacco use may be directly linked to our failing drug policy.

Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair. 
Let me read two paragraphs from the article: 
It is not clear how much of the increase in smoking amongst black teen-agers is due to the use of cigarettes with marijuana, and experts say advertising has been the major factor. But the marijuana-tobacco combination is notable because it is the reverse of the more common progression from cigarette and alcohol use to illegal drugs. 
Many black teen-agers said in interviews that they were drawn to cigarettes by friends who told them that nicotine would enhance their high from marijuana, which has been lore and practice among drug users of all races for decades. And this is apparently no mere myth. Many scientists who study brain chemistry say the link between cigarettes and marijuana is unproven but likely true. 
One other paragraph: 
The students were perfectly aware of the health hazards of cigarette smoking. A 17-year-old at Norman Thomas High School in Manhattan said she was quitting because she might be pregnant. 
But that is the only reason she was quitting. 
A 15-year-old at Saunders [High School] said she did not smoke during basketball and softball season but resumed in between. 
The article also talks about the effects of the kind of antitobacco measures that are being discussed on the floor including pushing the price of cigarettes to $3.50 to $4 to $5 a pack. Adolescents overwhelmingly said they would pay $3.60 a pack. The current charge in New York is $2.50. An additional $1.10 would move that to $3.60, and the teenagers did not see that as a problem. Now we are talking about the legislation that is being debated on the floor right now. According to the article: 
A few said that $5 a pack might inspire them to quit, or at least to try. 
But faced with that high a tariff, 17-year-old . . . a student in Yonkers, had another idea. `At that price,' he said, `you might as well buy weed.' 
In other words, he was saying you might as well smoke marijuana because they are going to end up being about the same price. I don't think anybody on the floor of this Senate has thought about that. But the kids are thinking about it. Let us think about those words, Mr. President: `At that price, you might as well smoke weed.' 
It is always easy for the partisans of big government to come up with big spending, big bureaucracy plans, that whether or not it actually impacts the intended target, in this case teenage smoking, it is sure to have all sorts of unintended but predictable side effects. For example, how big of a tax increase are we looking at? Well, we don't know for sure. Why shouldn't we be looking at this as a big regressive tax, and I think I can say, in all fairness, the biggest regressive tax in American history? How effective will it be in actually curbing teenage smoking or, for that matter, adult smoking? How much more attractive will it make others? By that, I am talking about illegal drugs such as marijuana, especially to young people. 
Well, that teenager from Yonkers said it: If you are going to raise tobacco to that price, you just might as well smoke weed. Have we learned anything at all from the black market of other nations? That has been discussed by some of my colleagues on the floor in the last several weeks, and they have used it as an example and it bears repeating because it shows a reaction to 
the marketplace. 
In Canada, by 1992, a pack of cigarettes cost about $4.50 in U.S. dollars, probably about $6.75 in Canadian dollars, while the price in the United States was $2. The result: the loss of billions of dollars in tax revenue and up to 40 percent of the Canadian market supplied by smuggling, black market, illegal, under the table, vended in the alley, out of the backs of cars, vended by the black market of drug dealing. Canada rolled back its tobacco taxes in 1994, and Sweden recently dropped its tobacco tax over 25 percent. Do we really want to repeat their mistakes? We are about to start. When cigarettes in Mexico cost about $1 a pack, where do you think the border will be? Or, more importantly, how can we protect the border? The movement will be significant. 
Does anyone think this would not be a tremendous windfall for organized crime or for cross-border drug trade in Mexico, which is already at epidemic proportions? How many funding streams is that? Well, taxes, we know that. And if those funding streams that we are asking for to fund all of this dry up, then how do we pay for the programs? Because they will surely dry up. Other nations have found that to be the case. And they have had to back off, to up their moneys, to up their cash flow again to fund the programs that they were going to feed off of the taxes they raised from tobacco. 
As a Republican, I think this big government approach is just the wrong way to go, especially when we have no real assurance that these programs will do any good. 
We need to take a hard look at drug use. And, yes, the teen tobacco use situation in this country that we find is critical. We need to look at it in a practical and a principled way. The bottom line should be this: If the Clinton administration won't lead on drugs--and at this point I would say their credibility on drugs has been fatally compromised--then it is the Congress that should lead. We should lead. That is our job--to create public policy that makes sense for the American people. That is why my colleague, Paul Coverdell of Georgia, and I are offering this amendment which would ensure that the drug crisis is not ignored as we attempt to address the tobacco problem. 
This amendment collects a number of initiatives that would make a serious impact on illegal drugs. It takes a three-pronged approach: attacking the supply of drugs by strengthening our ability to stop them at the border, providing additional resources to fight drugs that reach our neighborhoods, and by creating disincentives for teens to use illegal drugs. 
Let me talk about some of those provisions that are embodied in our amendment. Let me first talk about the one on supply, the supply side of the drug problem, because we all know it is a supply-demand equation. We cannot rely just on treatment programs for those who have already started to abuse drugs. And you know there is a bit of that attitude--well, yeah, if they get hooked on them, we will treat them. The problem is sometimes they get hooked on them, and they get killed or they die before they can get to treatment. We must stop drugs from getting to our kids in the first place, or make every effort to try to stop it. 
One key step in fighting the drug supply is increased resources for the interdiction of those drugs; in other words, law enforcement. Fund them, put them on alert, make it a No. 1 priority. This is the area where the administration has been most irresponsible. Slashing the Coast Guard's antidrug budget, with the result--and you know what the result was--a major disruption in the rate of decline. The number of seizures for drug shipments turned back before they reached the United States--listen to these figures; it happened on the President's watch after he slashed the interdiction money--declined by 53 percent. We are talking interdiction, at the border or out in the water; a 53-percent decline in interdiction from 1992 to 1995. 
So, what does our amendment do? We give the Coast Guard, the Defense Department, the U.S. Customs Service, the resources they need to target that interdiction before drugs reach the American streets. Our amendment does exactly that, and that is our intent. Our amendment also includes the Drug-Free Borders Act, which attacks the 70 percent of illegal drugs that enter our country across the Mexican border. Mr. President, 70 percent of the problem is right there on that very identifiable border. These provisions would increase the penalties for crimes of violence and other crimes committed at our borders and enable the INS to hire thousands--yes, thousands--of new Border Patrol agents. 
But our amendment does not just stop at the border; it also strengthens the hand of law enforcement in fighting drug dealers at home and abroad. For example, our amendment increases the resources available to DEA and the FBI. We also think parents deserve to know if convicted drug dealers have moved into their neighborhoods. Our amendment requires released Federal convicts, convicted of major drug crimes, to register with local law enforcement personnel, who can then put their communities on notice. Why not? Those are the folks who have been killing our kids by selling drugs. Why not let the communities know if they are back in those communities? These are only some of the provisions in our amendment that attack the supply of drugs. 
We also focus on the demand side of the problem by supporting local efforts to protect our neighborhoods, businesses, and schools from drugs and provide incentives for young people to stay straight. Our amendment includes a provision addressing needle exchange programs. At a time when drug use, particularly heroin use, is increasing, this program clearly undermines our effort to fight illegal drugs. What program? The current program. The Clinton program. The green light to subsidizing needle exchange programs. That is the green light for drug use. The House has already passed legislation to stop this, H.R. 3717, by a strong 287 to 140 vote. The Senate should do the same. Our amendment includes just exactly this. I hope the Senate can support it. 
Another section of our amendment is the Drug-Free Student Loan Act. It restricts loan eligibility for students who use drugs. This would target substance abuse without creating Federal mandates or authorizing new spending. It puts the kids on notice: `We ain't going to tolerate it anymore. Be straight, you will get your education. You can have a loan for it. But, use drugs and you are falling out of favor with the public.' 
The Drug-Free Teen Driving Act in our amendment would encourage States to be at least as tough on driving privileges 
for those who use drugs and drive as those who are drunk drivers. Stop and think about the inconsistency today. You get caught a drunk driver, you get your license pulled. Drug abuse? No. No. We are not addressing that. This amendment does. Same treatment. 
Our amendment includes the Drug-Free Workplace Act. This section provides incentives for employers to implement antidrug programs in the workplace, such as clear antidrug policies, drug testing, and employees' assistance programs. We also assist schools in the fight against drugs by allowing them to use Federal funds for drug testing programs and victims' assistance. Our amendment also provides incentives for States to create an annual report card to parents and teachers, listing incidents of school violence and drug activities. 
Another critically important part of our amendment would back up communities in their fight against drugs. We would authorize matching grants funds to support communities' efforts to establish comprehensive, sustainable, and accountable antidrug coalitions. 
Senator Coverdell and I recognize you cannot do all of this from the top down, that you have to work with the grassroots and help it grow from the bottom up. These and other provisions in our amendment are commonsense measures to protect our young people from the growing menace of drugs. They would counter the wrongheaded policies of this administration and start sending the right signals to America's youth. 
This amendment does not set up new bureaucracies nor impose new mandates. It supports law enforcement's attack on the suppliers of drugs. It also supports local efforts to control drugs in neighborhoods, schools, and businesses. Nothing can be more important than supporting these local efforts, because they are the front line in the war on drugs. And right now, with the efforts in communities to be drug free, they are the only line, the only real line that is working. We do not need the hammer of the Federal Government to force communities to take action. As I have mentioned, they are already at it. All they need is a few resources and our help. 
Let me give an example of something that is happening in my State that I am so proud of. It is called the Enough Is Enough campaign. It is a community-based drug prevention campaign driven by the private sector. No government dollars or controls are involved. Why? The problem became so bad in the Clinton years, the communities had to take it on. They said, `If we cannot get help from the Federal Government, we will do it ourselves,' because they saw the numbers going up and they saw the deaths occurring. 
Most people in Idaho agree that this program is the most effective antidrug, drug awareness campaign they have ever seen. It builds on the systems within every community that influence and involve specific groups of individuals. It recognizes that each system has a special, specific role to play in the prevention that is necessary and that it involves all of the community. It unites these systems. It includes the media and the public and private sectors behind a common goal--to equip our children to walk drug free through a drug-filled world. It focuses on community teamwork to fight the drug culture and regain the quality of life for our children. Enough Is Enough is the largest community-wide drug prevention effort in Idaho's history. Antidrug advocate Milton Creagh has delivered his challenge to communities all over the State. More than 100,000 people have already participated in the program, and additional community coalitions are being formed every day. 
This program is proof that the Federal Government does not have all the answers. In fact, the Federal Government can do a lot of harm by forcing wrong programs and wrong incentives on local communities and citizens. Instead, we should provide encouragement, support local antidrug initiatives, and that is the philosophy behind our amendment: Get our law enforcement involved, stop the stuff at the border. 
In offering the amendment to the antitobacco bill, I have been arguing that the danger posed by illegal drugs is greater and more immediate and more deadly than any immediate problem that tobacco poses on teenage America. 
It is my strong belief that the bill before us tonight must not ignore the drug crisis that threatens our youth, America's future. 
Having said all that, however, I do not mean to suggest that we should ignore teenage smoking. Let me repeat that for the Record, because I am quite sure there are some who will say, `Well, Coverdell and Craig are trying to switch the focus.' No; we are trying to refocus. We are trying to do fine focus. We are trying to get this Government pointed in the right direction. In fact, as I have already pointed out, there is a connection between youth smoking and drug use. 
There are a number of commonsense antismoking measures we should seriously consider, but I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to the one thing in particular we know to be effective in combating not just teenage smoking, but drug use, violence, suicide, sexual behavior, and emotional disturbances. 
In an area that is fairly underrated and where the Clinton administration definitely has been a part of the problem, the one thing is parental involvement in their children's lives. A recent Washington Post article entitled `Love Conquers What Ails Teens, Studies Find' summarized the results of a Federal study known as the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health based on a survey of 90,000 students grade 7 through 12 and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association:  
Teenagers who have a strong emotional attachment to their parents and teachers are much less likely to use drugs and alcohol, attempt suicide, engage in violence, become sexually active at an early age. 
That is what the Post reported. 
Though less important than the emotional connection, the presence of parents at home at key times in the morning, after school, at dinner, at bedtime make teenagers less likely to use alcohol, tobacco and marijuana. 
Mr. President, the Federal Government cannot mandate family cohesion, but I cannot think of a better argument for passing S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. That would encourage a host of comptime-flextime options for America's parents. Why am I talking about this when we are trying to stop teenagers from smoking, when we have an amendment on the floor about teenage drug abuse that we are trying to curb? Because it ought to be a part of the package. We ought to understand and not be so naive as to say that it is the total environment in which the child lives. 
I mention it only tonight for our Senate to understand that we cannot do it; we are blocked on the floor; it is not the right thing politically; somehow the unions oppose it. Why don't we wake up? Why don't we understand that Government can, in fact, by its inaction, be an impediment? 
Those are the conclusions I have drawn, and that is why I am a cosponsor with Senator Coverdell of this, what I believe to be the most important part of this total legislation. 
Mr. President, in the coming days, the Senate will be faced with a stark choice: We can be panicked down the road of least resistance to passing a big Government antitobacco bill that won't do the job but will become a permanent tax and regulatory nightmare, or we can pass some commonsense legislation that will help States, localities, communities, and, most of all, parents take charge of their children's future. We can mount a strong antismoking campaign, and we can assist States to do so. 
Really, when it comes to controlling our borders, when it comes to stopping the massive new flow of drugs into this country, stimulated by an administration that just doesn't want to face the issue, then it is time the Congress speak, and we can speak clearly and decisively if we vote, pass, and add as a major component to this tobacco legislation the Coverdell-Craig teenage antidrug amendment. 
It sets us in the right direction. It is a quantum step toward dealing with teenage drug use that, by everyone's measurement, is moving at an astronomical rate, taking lives in unbelievable numbers. We hear the statistic, 3,000 kids start smoking every day, and that is true, but thousands try drugs and get hooked and thousands die within a very short time. 
Thank goodness that in your adult years, if you are a smoker, sometimes common sense hits you like it hit me, that it was the wrong thing to do, that it wasn't healthy, that it was socially unacceptable, and that it was not going to cause me to be a good influence over my children, and I quit. But I doubt seriously that in my youth, if I had been hooked on drugs, I might not have had the opportunity to quit. 
I hope this Congress awakens to the real issue, and I think my colleague from Georgia and I are bringing the real issue to the floor of the U.S. Senate. We will debate it tomorrow, and we will debate it Monday. I hope that we have a resounding vote in favor of the Coverdell-Craig amendment, that it become a part of this total package, and that we deal with it in a fair and responsible way, then find and bring about the funding necessary to ensure that we can put our Coast Guard back to interdiction, that we can stop the flow at the borders, that we can go after the pusher on the street, and that we can show our young people that starting or experimenting with drugs is not only unacceptable as a part of the American culture, but that we will insist they quit for their safety and for their future. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me join my colleague from Nevada and say we are debating a motion to proceed. To proceed to what? To proceed to something that the House and the Senate of the U.S. Congress have spoken to in a substantial majority for the last 3 years, which is that the Government of the United States should honor the 1982 Nuclear Waste Act and take possession of the waste that they promised the utilities they would take in return for the ratepayers paying out billions of dollars to build a permanent repository. 
The Senators from Nevada have alluded that there is no cost or obligation. It is the word of our Government; it is the law that speaks. It is a solemn obligation under taxes that we have taken to take possession and build a permanent repository. The courts have also, just in the last year, clearly reflected that. This administration has had to quietly admit it. Now they are fighting in court saying, `We don't want our hands dirtied by our obligation.' 
Mr. President, you are without claim, you are without program, but you aren't without politics. I must say that when the Senators from Nevada talk about the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board saying certain things, let me remind the Senate the chairman of that board was appointed by this President. Would it be so unusual that he would reflect the political attitudes of this President? I suggest not. 
Now, I find it very interesting that the Senators from Nevada are standing on the floor today wringing their hands and suggesting that we are avoiding the debate on tobacco. Since when has the Senate been a single legislative body? Under the leadership of Democrats and Republicans alike, for the purpose of moving timely policy issues, this Senate has dealt with a multitude of issues. That is exactly what the majority leader is attempting to do today--to start a process on the nuclear waste bill and to move on with tobacco. 
Who has denied the Senate the right to do two things at one time? The Senators from Nevada. They are the ones that say it is either/or and it is not both. So I find it a bit ironic that they would suggest today that thousands of children may die from tobacco. Let me tell you that any child that starts smoking tobacco doesn't die from it immediately; 10, 15, 20 or 30 years down the line, if they are foolish enough to continue, they might. So back off. That is an illogical argument, and the reality is very clear. This Senate is capable of doing a multitude of things, and we must if we are going to move timely policy issues for this country. 
Oh, my goodness, Dr. Richard Wilson is suggesting that waste stored at generating sites is safe. What is the difference between storage at a generating site and storage at a temporary site awaiting final disposition in the Nevada desert? Well, I will tell you that there is a difference. The difference is that neither is a problem. So to the Senators from Nevada who claim this great difficulty of human risk to the State of Nevada, there is no risk, by the admission of Dr. Richard Wilson. What there is, is the reality of the law and a timely responsible disposition of this issue. 
How can any Senator stand on the floor and say we are going to collect $14 billion in taxes, which we have done, and then we are going to turn and run away from the issue and spend the money elsewhere? That is what the Senators from Nevada are suggesting. They are suggesting that somehow we collect the money, but we have no obligation after the fact. 
The law and the courts are clear. The reality is that we move toward the development of a permanent repository. And while we are doing that, and while it is the Congress of the United States that, by law, designated Yucca Mountain for the purpose of the necessary scientific and engineering studies to determine its desirability for that, we have the responsibility of the law to fulfill the obligation. 
By the way, what Dr. Richard Wilson did not say is that every site that stores waste at every generating site today, by definition, is temporary--by definition, is temporary. And yet it is safe. Yes, it is safe. It has been well managed. But because it is temporary, the Congress of the United States in 1982 said it is time this country developed a permanent--permanent--resolution of this issue. 
I would suggest, with a smile on my face, that the Senators from Nevada, when using the tobacco argument, are hiding behind a bit of a smokescreen today. But let's clear the smoke and face the reality that we can deal with more than one issue at one time in this Chamber. The Senators from Nevada are denying us the ability to deal with tobacco, because if we get cloture today, we are on nuclear waste, and we will stay there until this issue is resolved, when we could move forth and debate both tobacco and nuclear waste with a timely allocation to each issue for the purpose of resolving it to final disposition. 
That is what the majority leader was talking about. That is what this Senate is trying to do. It is our obligation, and it is our responsibility. The Senator from Alaska has talked about the waste, the amount of storage facilities, and what we are attempting to do--81 sites in 41 States, commercial spent fuel. Are big utility companies trying to shove off the responsibility, as has been alluded to by the Senators from Nevada? Quite the contrary. The big utility companies entered into an agreement with their Government. They signed a contract, and they paid the tax. Is that shoving anything off? Absolutely not. It is the reality of the law, and the Senators from Nevada know that. 
Can I blame them for their arguments in defense of their State? No. But they are not entitled to their own truth when it does not match the reality of the law. Facts cannot be generated on a daily basis. The reality is very clear--$14 billion later and better than a decade and a half, the Congress of the United States has not forced their Government and has not forced this administration to own up to the law, and it is now time we do so. A majority of this body agrees with that; 65 Senators agree with it, 307 House Members, because they understand that they have an obligation to uphold the contractual relationship of this Government as was established. 
And what did our courts say? Yes, contracts mean something. Last year, the Supreme Court said: You have a contract; the Government is responsible for delivering on the contract. The Senators from Nevada say quite the contrary. Well, they can debate about the Supreme Court if they want to; I will not. What the legislation that we have before us proposes to do is to honor the contract and to do so in a reasonable and timely way, to build a temporary repository, to begin to handle waste in the very way, the very safe way, by the admission of the Senator from Nevada, that it is being handled at temporary sites. 
So what is the fear? I think there is none. In fact, if you study the issue, you know there is no fear. How many nuclear bombs were trucked right down through the middle of Las Vegas--hundreds of them were--as they moved out to the test site in Nevada for the purpose of their testing. We in this country have the phenomenal integrity of managing nuclear waste in a sound and safe way. And that is the record. We know that is the record. But the legislation that we have before us, or 
at least that we are attempting to get to, even tightens up on that. It even gets much, much tougher. It goes on to talk about the responsibility of establishing the transportation sites and working with the States to assure that those transportation sites' integrity is maintained. 
Nevada as a State, as does my State of Idaho, has had a long history of dealing safely and soundly with nuclear materials and doing it in a way that has been cost-effective, that has brought hundreds of millions of dollars to our State in the form of revenue, jobs, and taxation. 
Is it a double standard we talk about today? Not this Senator. It is a contractual obligation of our Government to find and build a permanent repository for the long-term safe disposition of nuclear waste material. That is the debate today. I cannot blame the Senators from Nevada for the fight they put up. But it is very clear where this Congress and where this Government intends to go, and it has been very clear since 1982, because that is what the citizens of our country have wanted, and that is what we have obligated ourselves to do. 
We have a nuclear legacy that some would like to walk away from, but it is a nuclear legacy of which this country can well be proud.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this Nation has a nuclear legacy that some would like to shy away from. It is, in fact, the legacy of which I am proud. It has brought safety and security to this country for decades. Now we must handle it in a responsible fashion, because from that legacy there is a debt, and the debt is the safe and responsible management of nuclear waste from the military side. 
Some years ago, we decided that a permanent repository would also house high-level military nuclear waste. While all of that legacy is a responsibility of our Government and our citizens, there is another legacy that we can be even more proud of, and that is the history of the commercial electrical generating industry that chose to generate electricity from nuclear energy. About 20 percent of our electrical base today is nuclear, and our scientists and environmental friends tell us that if we are to obtain the clean air standards in the nonattainment areas, we will probably have to have more nuclear generated electricity, or at least we will have to keep the same ratios even with the growth of our country. 
All of a sudden, out of a Kyoto discussion comes a new recognition of a phenomenally clean, safe form of electrical generation. We all understand that. We all find it terribly important. If we are going to address the reality of climate change--and all of us are concerned about it--one of our obligations is to provide a safe, clean source of energy, and it is nuclear. And to do so, we must find a safe, clean way to handle the spent fuel. That is what we have understood for a long time, and that is what this country will demand. 
That is what we are putting forth today--to deal with this legislation, to put it to the President, hopefully, for his signature. And I will tell you that the Senators from Nevada have said he might veto it. Well, the President of the United States does not run the legislative branch of Government, nor should we view that threat as something that would deter or direct our policy formation. We are a separate branch, and while the President might suggest he would veto it, we also have the power to override. And in the last vote we had on this issue, we missed that by one vote. I am convinced today, based on the increased importance of this issue and the reality of the court tests and the simple explanation of our President as he throws his political hands up and says, `I have no solution to the problem, and I will do nothing,' even though the courts and the law say he must, that he is acting in a fully irresponsible fashion. The Congress of the United States knows that, and 41 States know that. And the public is beginning to say, `Wait a moment, Mr. President. You have an obligation under the law. Didn't you take an oath of office? Aren't you responsible for upholding the law?' 
But so is the Congress. And the Congress and the President, in concert, can resolve this issue. The resolution is in the very legislation that we are attempting to debate on the floor, to build a safe, temporary repository to begin to take possession of the waste that we promised we would in 1982 as we began this process and as we began to tax the ratepayers of the nuclear-generating utilities of this country. 
We can do that and we should do that, if that is what we debate today. This is not a debate about tobacco. That is a false argument. It was the Senators from Nevada and the minority leader who denied the Senate the right to debate both issues. So let us not use that again. It is a phony argument. It is a false-based argument. This Senate, under Democrat or Republican leadership, has dealt with two or three issues at a time. When we get under time constraints, as we are in this political year when our colleagues will want to be out campaigning by early October, there will be many times on the floor of the Senate when we will want to deal with multiple issues. 
This is one where some have chosen to be selective, but let the record show that is a false choice. We can do both. We should do both. That is the intent. That is why we are here today, to debate a motion to proceed so we can handle both at the same time in a responsible way, so we can turn to our citizens and our electorate and say, as we close the business of the 105th session of the U.S. Senate, that we dealt in a timely fashion with our environmental responsibilities with nuclear waste, high-level waste materials, and that we also dealt with the responsibility to the teenagers of America, and that is to deal with tobacco and try to restrict it from their access and their use. We can do both, and we should, and that is what we are attempting here this afternoon. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to congratulate a former Idahoan on his successful climb of the world's tallest peak. 
Mr. President, last month I reported to the Senate a story of my constituents who were climbing Mount Everest. While the climb is not a new adventure to the world, the climbers are. A group of disabled Idahoans, led by former Idahoan Tom Whittaker, successfully reached the base camp of the Everest peak on May 19. On May 27 Tom continued on to the summit with another group, becoming the world's first amputee to reach the top. 
Tom had fallen ill the week prior to his final ascent; however, he would not be deprived of his ultimate goal. He had tried unsuccessfully to make the climb twice in the past, but was forced back by bad weather. This time, at the Everest website, climbers from around the world are congratulating Tom on his achievement, writing, `May his success inspire you to follow your dreams and know that your abilities are far more important than your disabilities, whatever they may be.' 
I would like to share that sentiment with America today. Tom did not get to his goal without hard work and sacrifice. He did not succeed on the first try. But he would not be denied his dream, and in my mind, Tom Whittaker has set an example to be emulated by all.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, why have we spent the last 3 days on the floor talking about tobacco? Nearly everyone who has come to the floor to talk about tobacco has said we have to get it out of the hands of teenagers. There are two reasons we are on the floor talking about tobacco. First of all, it is darn good politics, and, secondly, we are mad at the tobacco companies and we are going to act in a very punitive fashion because they lied to us. They withheld information as to the addictiveness of nicotine, and we are angry as a public, angry as a governing body. We are going to inflict upon them a very punitive action, and we are going to do it in the name of teenagers--thousands of young people every day picking up a cigarette. 
I am not belittling it, I am recognizing it. We need to try to get tobacco and the substance within it, nicotine, out of the hands of our teenagers. But thousands of teenagers today who start smoking today will not die tomorrow. Let me repeat that. The thousands of teenagers that we are all talking about--and, boy, have we heard it on the floor in the last few days--who pick up a cigarette today will not die tomorrow. 
Mr. President, young people who engage in the use of drugs can die tomorrow. As my colleague from Georgia said, thousands are dying each year in violent actions and crimes related to drug use and drug associations. Yet, we stand silently by. The administration dropped the ball and walked away, and, finally, my colleague from Georgia rose up and said, wait a moment here, what in the heck are we doing as a country and as a policymaking body? If we are going to do all these great things for kids to get the cigarette out of their hand, why in the heck don't we get crack cocaine, marijuana, and amphetamines out of their hands because it kills them--not 30 years down the road. 
By the way, if you start smoking today, you have a chance to live, because you can quit down the road. But if you start crack cocaine today, you will probably die on the street in a month or two for one reason or another, because you are stealing the money to get the crap that is called crack, or you are shot in some transaction that went bad. 
That is how teenagers in America are dying today. The statistics that were just given by my colleague from Georgia about seventh graders and eighth graders is real. I have done the same thing that Paul Coverdell has done. I have gone to the schools of Idaho. I go to them regularly anyway. I spend a lot of time talking with teenagers, kids, and when I ask the question, `What is your problem?' the hands go up with drugs. Most of the hands go up. 
The Senator from Georgia is right. They know who sells it, and where you can get them. If they had a brand name on them, they would know the brand. Most importantly, if they had a brand name on them and they were being trafficked in the market today, we would be here going after the companies that were selling them because it would be killing our kids. 
But today we are angry. We are mad. We are going to be vindictive. We are after the tobacco companies. We are after their big money to fuel big government. I am not going to vote for a big tobacco bill. I am going to vote to get cigarettes out of the hands of teenagers. It is the right thing to do. 
But if we stand silently by and let what is described by my colleague from Georgia as the most significant epidemic amongst our youngsters go unspoken to and uncorrected, then we have erred grievously; we have erred grievously as policymakers. 
New polls are out. When you ask parents what they are worried about, here is what they say: Thirty-nine percent, using illegal drugs. Thirty-nine percent of the American public say that is the No. 1 problem. Sixteen percent say joining a gang. Nine percent say drinking alcohol. Why? You get drunk, you get in the car, and you kill somebody, and you kill yourself. 
Why then are we on the floor to spend weeks and millions of dollars trying to reach out and get billions of dollars out of tobacco? I will tell you why. Because it is good politics. Yet only 3 percent of the American people say they worry about it when they worry about their kids. 
It is time we speak out. That is what my colleague from Georgia, my colleague from Michigan, and I are doing. We will have an amendment on the tobacco bill that will deal with this issue, or there will be no tobacco bill. 
We must wake up the White House, wake up our Government, and wake up this policy body to what we are about to do. Here is what we want to do. We want to attach legislation that deals with this issue in a most significant way targeting three primary areas: Attacking the supply of drugs by strengthening our ability to stop them at the border; pull the mothballed Coast Guard fleet out and put it back in the water. Bill Clinton put it there. The heck with Bill Clinton. Put the money back in. Get them out in the water, and stop by interdiction. That is what our amendment does. 
Second, we want to provide additional resources to fight drugs that reach our neighborhoods. Give the tools to the law enforcement communities and the schools and the communities at large to join together to block grant and create their own initiative along with our directed initiatives to get at the problem at the local level. 
Then the third thing is to create disincentives for teen use of illegal drugs. 
Those are the three major areas that will be involved in what we are about to do. We are going to spend a lot of time on the floor week after next until this proposal, this amendment, is part of the overall bill that will move, I believe, out of here. 
So what do we have to do? When it comes to the supply side, we have to go straight at it. We have to deal with interdiction. We have to strengthen the borders. We have to stop slashing Coast Guard budgets and put some money back in it. 
We talked about a 53-percent decline from 1992 to 1995 in the ability of the Coast Guard to reach out and interdict. That 
simply has to stop. Our amendment does exactly that. 
Our amendment also includes the Border-Free Drug Act, which attacks 70 percent of the illegal drugs that enter the United States across the United States-Mexican border--70 percent of the drugs that are killing our kids on the street today, not 20 years down the road--today coming across the border from Mexico to the United States. 
So why not put more people on the borders? I think we ought to. We ought to strengthen the Immigration and Naturalization Service to hire Border Patrol agents to deal with the trafficking and get at the business of going at it. For example, our amendment increases the resources available to DEA and the FBI. 
An additional section of our amendment is the Money Laundering Prevention Act. 
Finally, last week this administration announced a major break in drug laundering with Mexican banks. We have arrested a few people. And we are trying to get the cooperation of the Mexican Government now because the money is big. How big? We are trying to get $800 billion away from the tobacco companies to spend on big government and some advertising that we think will convince our teenagers to quit smoking. But $100 billion a year in the drug business kills thousands of teenagers. And we have not spoken to that. Why don't we go after that? I hope we can. We should. That is our goal. 
While we deal with it in a national and an international way, we have to turn to our parents and we have to turn to our communities. The kids know who the drug dealers are. We ought to start asking them and involving them a little bit and recognizing the importance of that. We do that. We go after the demand side along with the supply side. 
I think the Clinton administration's green light to subsidize needle exchange and programs like that doesn't make a lot of sense. That is an encouragement. We want to stop that. 
Our legislation is comprehensive. The amendment that we will talk about over the recess and will offer as soon as we get back is going to be critical. Pieces of what we are doing have already passed the Congress in one way or another. 
We want to bring them together to create the focus to do the same thing against drugs as we have done against alcohol. You get caught as a teenage drunk driver you lose your driver's license. You get caught using drugs as a teenager you drive on. We will encourage the States to take the driver's license away. 
Let me say in closing, Mr. President, that if we are really worried about kids, yes. I agree. Let's get the cigarettes out of their hands. But let's stop them from their access to drugs of all forms. It kills them tomorrow. It killed thousands last year. It will kill thousands this year. As a policy-making body, we would be remiss not to deal with this issue now and force this administration to get out of their sleepwalk and deal with the issue in cooperation with us. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in observance of the tenth annual National Foster Care Month, May, 1998--a month when the nation commemorates the outstanding contributions that foster parents make every day to the lives of some of our most vulnerable young people. 
Children are our nation's greatest hope and responsibility. Every child deserves a loving, permanent family. Unfortunately, nearly half a million American children find themselves without a family to count on, victims of violence, drugs, or neglect. With the help of foster parents, these children can live in an environment that is safe, stable, and full of love. Yet all too often, the compassion and caring of foster parents go unrecognized. 
Let me tell you about an Idaho family who have been foster parents for ten years. Arthur and Janet Mayer have fostered more than 140 boys throughout those years. It is impossible for most of us to imagine--much less imitate--the tremendous commitment of time and energy these fine people have made to their foster children. Later this month, they will be recognized in my state with the Lifetime Achievement to Foster Care Award. I am pleased to express my admiration of Arthur and Janet, and my appreciation for their dedicated service to children and families. 
National Foster Care Month gives us an opportunity to commend not only the Mayers, but also the more than 100,000 foster parents across the nation who have opened their homes and hearts to young people in need of temporary refuge. Whether they help 140 children or one, these individuals are making a critical contribution that will resonate long into the future. I hope all of my colleagues will join with me in encouraging families in their own states to participate in the foster care program and applauding the important work of our nation's foster parents.

Mr. CRAIG. I have sat for well over an hour now this morning, listening to the colloquies, the questions, and the debates between the Senator from Missouri and the others who engaged him, concerned as we all are about teenage smoking, and concerned as we all are about what appears to have been a targeted effort on the part of some tobacco companies to increase teenage smoking. But the Senator from Missouri also cited a poll, as did the Senator from Texas, that indicates that amongst Americans the No. 1 issue with their teenage children is not smoking but drugs. Would the Senator from Missouri agree with that?

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. As a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I have worked with Chairman Lugar and the Committee for two years to see this Act crafted and passed. I am pleased that the Leader has allowed it to come to the floor and encourage my colleagues to support its adoption. 
Mr. President, the bill reforms and reauthorizes discretionary agricultural research programs that play an important role in keeping our nation's farmers competitive in the ever expanding world market. These programs and extension activities have experienced dramatic returns--in the form of better land management, environmentally sound farm practices, increased crop yield, improved crop varieties, and countless other ways--and represent a sound investment in the future. The bill's reforms will ensure more collaboration and efficiency in federally funded research and provide for greater accountability to the American taxpayers. 
The bill also provides $600 million over the next five years in mandatory funding to the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. This new mandatory spending will provide $120 million per year on a competitive grant basis for six high priority mission areas: agricultural genome research; food safety, food technology, and human nutrition; new and alternative uses of agricultural commodities and products; agricultural biotechnology; natural resource management, including precision agriculture; and farm efficiency and profitability. 
In addition, the bill addresses the immediate concerns facing all those who rely on federal crop insurance, provides for the Fund for Rural America, and funds food stamps for the elderly, disabled, and children of the nation's poorest immigrants. 
Mr. President, more than just a reauthorization bill, the legislation before the Senate today is an investment in the future and represents our commitment to America's farm families. By providing the technical research and extension activities that help expand farm income, improve resource management, and develop new crop varieties, federally funded agricultural research assures that our nation will continue to lead the world in farm production and help bolster the stability of our rural areas. 
I encourage all my colleagues to support its adoption.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to share a story about an extraordinary group of Idahoans. 
As I drove into work this morning, my thoughts were with this group of my constituents in Nepal, very far away from home and even farther away from Washington, D.C. These Idahoans are attempting to climb Mt. Everest. Only a handful of people have climbed the mountain over the years and succeeded. Others have failed in their attempt, but very few people have ever tried to climb the mountain at all. It is a challenge that could mean death at every turn. For this group of Idahoans, however, the climb means life around every corner. 
The climbers are all physically disabled. These disabled trekkers are affiliated with the Cooperative Wilderness Handicapped Outdoor Group at Idaho State University, affectionately known as HOGs. This group's philosophy is, `Hey, just because you're disabled, it doesn't mean that your life is over.' And they are proving exactly that. The group's journey is being documented on the internet, so that updates on their progress can be found frequently. On their website they write, `Disabled people are ignored, not really discriminated against, but ignored. I've seen families where a relative is newly disabled and they didn't let him do anything. This at first is a well-meaning attitude, but later it effectively takes a disabled person's power away to make choices. We're making a choice with this Everest Trek. It's going to be really hard, but we are going to give it our best.' 
Disability comes in different forms for the participants. Kyle Packer, an Idaho State University student of the year, has Cerebral Palsy. Isaac Gayfield set many Idaho State University track records. He now has Degenerative Bone Disease. Tom McCurdy is an Idaho State University student who happens to be a paraplegic. Steve DeRoche is a weight lifting coach and a double amputee. Sheila Brashears lost a leg to cancer. Carla Yustak, who has Cerebral Palsy, is an Olympic trainee for cycling when she isn't climbing mountains. 
And then there is Tom Whittaker. The founder of the CW-HOG organization, Tom lost his foot in an automobile accident in 1979, shortly after finishing his Masters degree at Idaho State University. An avid outdoor adventurer, Tom felt as if his life had come to an end--but he overcame his disability, and then some. Now a professor of adventure education at Prescott College in Arizona, Tom is poised to become the first amputee to stand on the summit of Everest. While the rest of the team plans to end its journey upon reaching the base camp of the summit, Tom will travel the final stage to the peak as the sole disabled participant. 
I want to personally congratulate this group for their efforts so far. They are expected to reach the base camp today and Tom is set to reach the summit later this month. It is indeed a defining moment for disabled people in America and around the world. 
Mr. President, let me share what was written about Tom Whittaker in his online profile: `* * * [he] reminds us, when setbacks occur in our personal and professional lives, it is not the falling down, but the getting back up that matters. The essence, in the heart of the American Dream, is not money, status or power, but the freedom to dream and the courage to embrace those dreams--for all people. As a people, we love to compete and we love to win. But more than anything, Americans applaud the grit and spirit it takes to get back up and finish the race.' 
In closing, I want to recognize their spirit today. It is my hope that everyone who hears their message might be inspired to face and conquer their own challenges, and by so doing, become not only better persons but better Americans.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before I discuss these three amendments en bloc, let me say, as so many of us have on the floor over the last several days, how proud we are of Senator Bill Roth for the very statesmanlike approach he has taken toward major reform of the Internal Revenue Service. His committee, the Finance Committee of this Senate, and the hearings he has held with the full participation of Democrats and Republicans alike in most instances, is producing the first significant reform in the IRS in its history in well over 200 years. We are reversing a trend that over 200 years progressively took away from the average citizen, the taxpayer, more and more of their rights as individuals, their personal power upon themselves, and their own financing. So what we do here today and what we have been doing for several days is phenomenally significant. I am tremendously proud of our chairman, Bill Roth, and the statesmanlike approach he has taken. 
Let me also say that the leadership of our majority leader, Trent Lott, has also helped to cause this to happen. He has supported our chairman and insisted that we move this along in a timely fashion. Of course, I am pleased that the American public is supportive of what we are doing. They know more than anyone else the importance of the reforms that we are debating. 
While this is a major step taken forward, my three amendments touch on an area that really has not gone overlooked but is very seldom talked about; that is, taxpayer privacy and disclosure of taxpayer information. It is probably one of the more important areas. And it is something that a lot of our citizens simply don't know a great deal about. They assume, and you and I assume, Mr. President, that our information, our forms, our files at the IRS are very, very private. They are not. For the next few moments let me explain why they are not, and why my three amendments would make a major effort to correct that. 
While the citizens of our country believe that the agencies of the Federal Government responsible for collecting and administering our tax laws will hold their information confidential--and I think they have been led to believe that over the years--it just simply is not the case. 
I was stunned when I found out that under the Internal Revenue Code and the IRS regulations all it takes is one simple letter from State tax officials to get the IRS to turn over to thousands of officials across the Nation millions of pages of citizen returns. Those citizens have no way of finding out that their returns have been passed on in whatever manner. Does the IRS tell them? No. It doesn't. Does it state to them that at least they have been turned over to the State? Or does the State notify them that they are in possession of their Federal tax records? Again the answer is no. It doesn't tell them. You and I, Mr. President, would like to think that those are our private records. We know, as every citizen knows, that they are the most disclosing of all financial information that any citizen ever provides. And it is all considered, at least by the citizen, confidential. 
The evidence is very clear that there could be abuse. We don't know at this moment whether there has been State or local abuse. I say local abuse because we know that cities that have income taxes also can have made available to them those citizens' Federal IRS returns referenced. So what we don't know is where the abuse is occurring. What we do know is that these 
are released. 
More than 60 jurisdictions under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code are allowed to have access, all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Commonwealth and territories, plus all of the cities with income taxes and with populations of over 150,000. It is true that section 6103 of the code prohibits sharing tax return information--Watergate style, that is--with Governors and mayors. Or shall I say political individuals? But then you and I know, Mr. President, that in some of our States there still lurks and there always will lurk the `good ole boy' system. 
Who appoints the tax commissioner in the State? Very few are elected. The Governor does. Who has access to all of these files? The tax commissioner does. If I want to know something about an individual, and I am a Governor, or I am a mayor of the so described cities, is it impossible to get that information? Let me tell you. There is a law against doing that. But we know that law has not been enforced, or we know that in many instances. Who would ever find out? Do we have Federal agents at State collection agencies ensuring the security and the confidentiality of those thousands of records they have passed forward? No. Absolutely not. We couldn't afford it if it were the right thing to do. 
So what I am suggesting in my amendments is that we change the behavior, change the attitude. Drug dealers, child molesters, and organized crime individuals have more protection outside of the Tax Code than the average citizen has inside the Tax Code. 
Frankly, I am amazed that this type of sharing of confidential tax information has not been found to be an unreasonable search under the fourth amendment of the Constitution. 
I want to stress that this information is not passed along only in cases in which an individual is under investigation by a State or a local tax agency. One routine request will provide detailed computer tapes on virtually all of the taxpayers in that State. Then computers can be used to scan the tapes for any item of information that the State or the local officials think may indicate `fishy behavior,' or the tax return information of selected individuals may be accessed. And the taxpayer, again, let me repeat, is never told that his or her records are being passed around in the character and in the nature which I have described. 
What kind of confidential taxpayer information can be passed around so freely? I was astounded to find out how much. The kind of confidential tax information being handed out includes the taxpayer's annual tax returns, information returns, declarations of estimated taxes, claims for refunds, amendments, supplements, and supporting schedules and attachments. Worse yet, many types of information can be passed around simply because they are called return information. This can include the taxpayer's identity, the nature, the source, and the amount of income, any payments or receipts in the IRS files, and any deductions you may have taken. From that type of information it is possible to figure out what kind of house the taxpayer lives in, the amount of the debt that taxpayer has, if you are sick, if you are not sick. The confidential taxpayer information being passed around includes your net worth, your tax liability, any deficiencies in tax payments you have and the like. It gets worse. It doesn't get better because there are a lot of things in those files. 
The confidential information shared includes any data received or prepared by the IRS regarding a return deficiency, penalties, interest, offenses, and the like. It includes any information regarding actual or possible investigation of a return. And it also includes any part of an IRS written determination or background file document not opened to public inspection. 
Now, remember, I just said information not open to public inspection that can be sent out across the country to any lesser tax collecting agency. It may even include an incorrect or an unfavorable credit report, a report which under any other circumstance you could access, dispute, and correct. 
Generally, however, taxpayers do not have access to their own IRS files. Therefore, you, the taxpayer, have no way of checking the accuracy of the information or refuting incorrect information that may be passed back and forth freely amongst several levels of government. 
The bundle of amendments I have offered today does several things. My first amendment would advance the idea of not allowing this kind of confidential information to flow forward. I understand that States that have income taxes use the IRS code and its information to shape and define their own taxpayers, and I understand that if we were to stop that immediately it could cause grave impact on State tax collecting agencies. So what I have asked in this amendment, in the modification that I sent to the desk, is that we review through the study within the proposed law that we are debating now of 6103, that we look at this as a part of a study to see how we can shape the assurance of confidentiality, as information in some instances probably must flow to other tax collecting agencies. And I hope we can accept that. It is a study to begin to look at assuring confidentiality in an area that, very frankly, the committee did not take a lot of time looking at. 
The second amendment would limit the sharing of tax return information with States or local governments to circumstances in which its disclosure and use is necessary to administer a State or local income tax. So we are talking exclusively of an income tax calculation, not, if you will, the broad search for information. 
Under careful examination of section 6103, I noticed that large cities, as I mentioned, would receive confidential tax information only if they impose their own city income tax. So we want to limit it to just those cities that have an income tax. But States, the District of Columbia, territories, and Commonwealths could receive detailed, voluminous information on income tax returns as long as they assure the IRS that the information is somewhat related to State tax law; in other words, we want to make it specific: States, governments, local jurisdictions that have income taxes as a part of their revenue collecting and therefore to be very specific so that States that do not, cities, large cities of over 225,000 that do not, cannot request it because the law would deny, or allow the IRS to deny that kind of request of these very large volumes of confidential information. 
Amendment two would shape that and limit it. In short, this amendment simply says income tax information should only be shared for a relevant purpose--for income tax purposes, period. It would treat States and other jurisdictions the way the Tax Code already treats the larger cities. This amendment represents a modest first step toward better protection for taxpayer privacy. 
The third amendment requires the IRS to publish a reasonable disclosure to all taxpayers in the instruction booklets already accompanying the basic Federal income tax returns. This would simply be an explanation to the taxpayer in clear language, in conspicuous print, one page, in the front of the information booklet, the conditions under which the 
taxpayer's tax return information may be shared with any other party outside the IRS. 
In other words, it puts the taxpayer on notice that here is the limit and this is information they simply did not know before. I firmly believe that virtually none of America's taxpayers realize just how public their private tax records are. The very least we owe them is to disclose up front the circumstances under which their information will be shared. This would also assure them of the extent, however limited, to which their privacy is protected. This disclosure also should result in increased compliance with State and local tax laws since taxpayers will be reminded up front as they prepare their Federal return that the same information may be shared for State or local compliance purposes. Surely, the IRS can do this for its taxpayers. Taxpayers who will send $1.7 trillion this year to the Treasury of this country deserve to have a clear, one-page explanation of the extent to which their privacy is protected. 
Let me repeat that. One page of information, that is all it takes, in the front of the information book that goes out to every taxpayer. I do not want the regulators downtown to decide that it takes an entirely new book with multiple pages saying blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah. We want the taxpayer to know the circumstances and those who can receive this very private and very confidential information. So that is what should happen, and I believe these are amendments Congress should accept as we move to reform the IRS code. 
Mr. President, I urge adoption of amendment 2364, as modified, and I ask to set aside for the time being amendments 2365 and 2366.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, again, I applaud my chairman, Bill Roth, for the leadership he has brought on this most significant of issues. As I say, it is fun to be a part of rolling back 200 years of accumulation of assault on the American taxpayer that clearly this Senate is acting upon now in this major reform of the IRS. Of course, to our majority leader, and to all who have joined in the Finance Committee, it is especially important that we do this. 
So I hope that the disclosures I am talking about, the limitations as they relate to privacy and the confidentiality of this information can become a part of that reform. And then, of course, the other, an intense study to understand how far we can go and how we can work with income-tax-collecting State agencies and cities to assure even greater confidentiality is so very important. 
With those comments, I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the IRS Reform Act. I would like to begin by congratulating Chairman Roth for holding the recent IRS hearings. The Finance Committee's historic hearing have made it possible for us to consider this bill, and they have made the Senate version of the bill improved and stronger than the House-passed version of HR 2676. 
However, I'm disappointed by the recent remarks by the Minority Leader, who said the Chairman's hearings were `sensationalistic.' These hearing were not `sensationalistic,' but were instead about getting at the truth. They exposed sensationally bad news about how a powerful arm of government has treated individual taxpayers. Indeed, given the stories that emerged, even holding these hearings was a brave act. 
Without these hearings there would have been no appointment of William Webster to review the IRS Criminal Investigation Division; no announcement of a special internal task force; the public would not have known that even a Senate Majority Leader is not protected from bizarre, apparently criminal, targeting; the bill might not have been as strong as it is; and, after a brief flurry of attention, the IRS would assume it was safe to return to business as usual. 
There are many causes to the problems that these hearings exposed. The culture which pervades the IRS is arrogant, powerful, and a law unto itself--it is unaccountable to anyone else. The tax law, too, is to blame. After forty years of liberal Congresses encouraging and empowering the IRS, it seems as if their only goal is to get the money and that the ends justify the means. We also must not forget that individual IRS agents also overstep the law. We still want to believe most IRS employees are conscientious civil servants. However, the hearings show the IRS has not disciplined its own. In fact, the IRS culture has rewarded rogue activity, punished whistle blowers, and carried out retribution against innocent taxpayers. The problem of `rogue agents' is really more a problem of a rogue agency. Today, in law and in practice, drug dealers, child molester, and organized crime have more legal rights than the average taxpayer whom the IRS suspects may owe a few dollars in back taxes. 
The IRS abuses are part of a bigger problem. There is a culture of big government, growing like a cancer on the body politic for two generations, that says the money you earn isn't yours, it's the government's; that says freedom isn't the individual's unalienable right, it's the government's to give or take away; that promises compassion and support, but demands control and dependence. It may all be relative, but it's becoming more like Big Brother and less like Uncle Sam. 
Now is the time to turn that tide. A Republican Congress has started already. We enacted the welfare reform law of 1996, which expects individual responsibility and encourages individual and community initiative. We also passed the Balanced Budget and Taxpayer Relief Acts of 1997 which said we will put limits on the appetite of government. 
Now we must take the next step with IRS reform. More Americans come into contact with their government through the IRS than through any other means. This bill is the first significant step to reminding everyone that the taxpayer is the boss--not the IRS, not the government. 
But this bill is only the first step. We need continued and increased oversight of the IRS through more hearings. From calls and letters from our own constituents, Senators know the first few hearings only scratched the surface of the tip of the iceberg. Sunlight is the best protection the people have. We also need to look at more reforms, especially protecting due process and privacy rights and increasing accountability for wrongful actions. Continued, aggressive committee activity are also a must. 
The ultimate IRS reform will be abolishing the current tax code and starting over with a new, fairer system. Later this year we will take the next step--voting to sunset the tax code. This would underline our commitment to ending the tax code and the IRS as we know them; guarantee the American taxpayer we will build a new, fairer system, from the ground up; and force Congress and the President to come to terms on creating a new system. 
Of course, President Clinton and others will fight to preserve the status quo. For a while, they tried to block IRS reform, but saw the American people wouldn't stand for it. Now President Clinton wants to dress up as First Drum major and get out in front of the parade Congress started. Mr. President, we welcome your help, however belated, if it's sincere and substantial. But, Mr. President, at least have the honesty to say, `me, too' instead of, `my idea.' President Clinton and his allies still say sunsetting the tax code would create uncertainty, but a sunset creates no more uncertainty than the status quo, which has perpetuated uncertainty for decades with a major new tax bill about every two years. Opponents don't want major tax reform--they like the current code and the way it shakes down the taxpayer. They will use divide and delay tactics, pretending to support reform but making sure no one proposal breaks out of the pack. But the American people know better, tax reform will be debated thoroughly across the country between now and 2000. 
Now and in the future, the American people are demanding change. They want an IRS that is fair, courteous, and respects their rights of due process and privacy. Congress is committed to creating a new culture at the IRS, serving the taxpayer, not treating them like a criminal class; treating taxpayers with respect and dignity; pursuing criminals, not quotas; and upholding the Constitutional principle of `presumed innocent until proven guilty.' 
For the future, the American people demand fundamental change--a new tax code that is simple, fair, efficient, and allows working Americans and their families to keep more of the fruits of their labors. Republicans in Congress are committed to creating that completely new system.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today to talk about S. 1180, the Endangered Species Act reauthorization bill, and why I have decided to cosponsor it at this time. 
As our colleagues know, this bill was passed by the Environment and Public Works Committee last fall, and it is currently on the calendar, ready for consideration by the full Senate. I have been slow to cosponsor S. 1180 because of some reservations I had--and still have--about the bill. I will talk in more detail about those details in a minute. 
However, I am absolutely convinced that the current Endangered Species Act is not only a dismal failure at saving species, but is actually working against that goal. Furthermore, every day we tolerate this defective law, its unfair and unnecessary burdens increase on citizens and the economy. Yet at the same time, the American people continue to believe that conserving fish and wildlife species for the enjoyment of future generations is the right thing to do. And I certainly agree with that. They want to make changes to the law, but don't want to see the Endangered Species Act thrown out. 
That is why for the last three years, my colleague and friend from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, has been working mightily to improve this complex law. He has held hearings, built coalitions, drafted and re-drafted language to correct the problems while still advancing the goals of the Endangered Species Act. I congratulate him, as well as our other Senate colleagues who have worked with him to produce this bill.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, yesterday I put before the Senate a very straightforward amendment to our resolution of ratification that speaks to the responsibility of the President as it relates to getting authorization for the continued mission of our U.S. military in Bosnia. I say that in the context of us debating NATO expansion because I think it is appropriate. It is appropriate because of the way this President has characterized the need to expand NATO from his perspective. He speaks about it no longer as just a defense mechanism for Europe; he speaks of it as a mechanism for the purpose of peacekeeping. 
We have heard several of our colleagues come to the floor in the last good number of days as we have debated this issue, frustrated by what will be the role of a new NATO, and how should we define that--at least from our understanding--as we move for the purpose of ratification, upholding our constitutional responsibilities, which are paramount on this issue. 
I am one of those Senators who has said very openly that I don't believe we ought to be expanding NATO at this time. We ought to be encouraging the European Community to reach out to those nations that have now emerged from behind the fallen Iron Curtain--reach out to them in an economic way, bringing them into the economic union, creating greater economic stability rather than, if you will, offering them the olive branch of inclusion into NATO as some coming of age process, and turning to the United States and, in essence, saying, now you have to pay for it or you have to play a greater role--especially when I don't think any of us sense the dramatic urgency of an expanded defensive mission for the whole of a freer Europe. That strength would come through the economic growth of those countries and the greater strength of their democracies because of the economic growth. Some of us have also expressed concern about, of course, Russia and how it feels as we tend to expand a defensive peacekeeping mechanism toward them, and not being willing to focus as much as we should on assisting, ensuring the democratic processes in Russia itself. 
As a result of that, I think it is tremendously important that we cause this administration to define what its intent is. As you know, Mr. President, we are now in a period of time in Bosnia where we are operating without authorization from Congress. Costs are mounting in a tremendous way, and as a result of that, we have no end game in mind, no mission intent at this moment. 
My amendment is clearly straightforward. It is something the President should have done some time ago. But, of course, when he seeks authorization, then he can't keep diverting money out from under the defense system itself to fund an unending operation in Bosnia, or at least unending by his current definition. 
So what I am saying is really very straightforward: Mr. President, as you move forward with your commitment to an expanded NATO, come to us and ask for an authorization and ask for a definition, if you will, in cooperation with us on the role in Bosnia. I think this becomes increasingly important. Colleagues from the other side of this issue have said I am 
amending the treaty. Well, we all know that is not true. What we are talking about today is a resolution of ratification. I am putting within that resolution--if my amendment were to become part of it by this process--a condition which the President would have to respond to prior to being able to move forward with the blessings of Congress in a confirmation of the resolution of ratification. That is the intent of my amendment. It is very straightforward, clear, and it is quite simple. I don't believe it is convoluted or confusing in any sense of the words. Maybe there are those who don't want the President to seek authorization. But I can't imagine any of us who are willing to fund and participate in putting the men and women of the U.S. armed services in harm's way--that we don't, for some reason, define how that all ought to be. It is with that intent that we bring forward this amendment. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, again thanking my colleague, Senator Wellstone, for his courtesy, I will be brief. It is a very direct and simple amendment but I think a most powerful amendment. Let me read it. 
Statutory Authorization for Deployments in Bosnia and Herzegovina--Prior to the deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, there must be enacted a law containing specific authorization for the continued deployment of the United States Armed Forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of the NATO mission in that country. 
That is the substance of the amendment. This amendment would require that before the President can deposit the instruments of ratification, he must receive authorization from this Congress for the mission in Bosnia. 
Last May, President Clinton publicly embraced the idea of a new NATO mission. It is my concern that the President's vision of a new NATO will signal the end of NATO as a defense alliance and the beginning of a new role as a regional peacekeeping organization. The President declared, `We are building a new NATO. We will remain the strongest alliance in history, with smaller, more flexible forces prepared for our defense but also trained for peacekeeping. 
It will be an alliance directed no longer against a hostile block of nations but instead designed to advance the security of every democracy in Europe--NATO's old members, now members and nonmembers alike.' 
I cannot support the President's call for a new NATO to be a de facto peacekeeping organization worldwide. 
Mr. President, President Clinton's peacekeeping operation in Bosnia has been going on now for more than 2 years without authorization from Congress, with costs mounting far beyond any estimate, with the mission's end date repeatedly broken. The mission in Bosnia is now what we were promised it would not be, an unauthorized, open-ended, nation-building deployment with no withdrawal criteria. 
As costs for NATO's mission in Bosnia continue to add up, the President seems eager to take on new peacekeeping operations. Make no mistake; the U.S. is paying the lion's share of the peacekeeping in Bosnia. We all know these costs are high for the Defense Department. The Defense Department is forced to come to Congress for supplemental funds. We are now meeting in a conference of the Appropriations Committee to deal with those very issues for the Defense Department. 
In 1995, the President vowed that U.S. troop deployment in Bosnia should and will take about 1 year and cost about $1 billion. Three years and $8 billion later, the administration now admits we do not propose a fixed end date for the deployment. 
Let me be clear. My amendment is not a war powers resolution. It does not say the President cannot continue the deployment in Bosnia without authorization, nor does it cut off funds for Bosnia, nor does it set an end date for the mission, 
nor does it establish a withdrawal criteria. It does, however, require the President to cooperate with Congress to set reasonable parameters for that mission before the President gets a blank check in the form of a new NATO for more of other area missions. The commitment of U.S. troops to Bosnia is a commitment of U.S. blood, and expansion of NATO is an expansion of this commitment. The decision to place U.S. troops in harm's way is a commitment that none of us take lightly. We owe it to our troops to obtain authorization for peacekeeping missions. That is what my amendment sets forth.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, since September of 1997, the General Accounting Office, at my request, has been conducting an investigation into possible anti-lobbying violations--as well as possible violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act--at the Department of Education. 
This investigation is ongoing and I have no reason to believe at this time that the nominee in question, Mr. Fleming, is a key figure in this investigation nor have I been presented with any evidence of wrongdoing on his part that would compel me to oppose his nomination. I would, however, like to take this opportunity to urge Mr. Fleming, in his new capacity as Assistant Secretary of Education for Legislation and Congressional Affairs, to cooperate fully with the GAO investigation in order to resolve this matter expeditiously. 
Mr. President, let me explain my involvement with this issue and my concerns as they relate to allegations of an unusually close, and perhaps improper, relationship between the Department of Education and certain lobbyists in this town. 
This matter was first brought to my attention by an editorial that appeared in the Washington Post on September 4, 1997. 
That editorial, written by nationally syndicated columnist Robert Novak, described how--each week while Congress was in session--senior Department of Education officials and special interest group representatives gathered in Secretary Riley's conference room for what, in my opinion, amounted to `political action' or `legislative planning' sessions. 
News of these meetings surfaced in a report published by the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution's, Paul Steidler. For seven months, Mr. Steidler attended these meetings and kept detailed minutes of what was discussed. What emerges from the Steidler notes, if substantiated, is extremely troubling. 
Without discussing the particulars of this investigation, Mr. President, let me note that I take Mr. Steidler's allegations very seriously. Collusion between special interest lobbyists and the executive branch for the express purpose of defeating or promoting specific legislation, at the grass roots level or here in Congress, is unacceptable. 
Mr. President, the GAO investigation into these matters is still underway. And, as I said, it does not appear that Mr. Fleming was a central figure in the formation or conduct of the weekly meetings in question. 
My concern is that the Department of Education cooperate fully with this investigation so this body and the American people can be certain that the Department of Education's interests correspond with our children's best interests and not just the needs of those special interests that dominate the landscape here in Washington.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am filing an amendment related to the resolution of ratification for the proposed expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
Last May, President Clinton publicly embraced the idea of a `new NATO' mission. It is my concern that the President's vision of a new NATO will signal the end of NATO as a defensive alliance and begin its role as a global peacekeeping organization. 
I have several concerns about the President's vision for NATO, not the least of which is cost for a `new' NATO. It seems to me that if the President continues to eagerly commit our men and women in uniform to dangerous peace-keeping missions, for which, the U.S. invariably pays the lion's share of the cost, the United Nations should either be forced to reimburse us for those costs, or relieve our so-called arrears. 
Therefore, I will be offering an amendment which requires that prior to the deposit of the instrument of ratification for NATO expansion, the President must certify that the Senate has obtained a commitment from the United Nations that the U.S. will be reimbursed or credited for costs incurred in peace-keeping missions. 
I am offering this amendment because I am both concerned and frustrated by the tremendous costs that the U.S. incurs in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions around the globe. Our men and women in uniform are asked to do more and more, with less and less. Meanwhile, American taxpayers foot the bill for these missions. Yet, the United States is handed the single largest assessed contribution for any U.N. member, despite the huge commitments we maintain across the globe. 
I hope my colleagues will support this common-sense amendment to force the United Nations to account for the contributions that the United States has made to peace-keeping around the world.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, on May 2-4, 1998, more than 1,200 students will participate in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution Program. This is a three day academic competition on the Constitution and Bill of Rights here in Washington, D.C. I am proud to acknowledge students from Les Bois High School in Boise, Idaho, who have achieved the great honor of participating in this outstanding program. Under the direction of their teachers, Dan Prinzing and Janet Adams, these students have worked diligently to reach the national finals by winning competitions in Idaho. 
Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the primary goal of the We the People . . . program, is to promote civic competence and responsibility among the nation's elementary and secondary students. This instructional program is designed to increase the students' understanding of American constitutional democracy. By providing firsthand experience, students are able to witness the relevance of the Constitution and Bill of Rights in dealing with contemporary issues. 
Participation in the national finals requires that the students demonstrate their knowledge of constitutional principles and their relevance to current issues before a simulation of congressional committees composed of constitutional scholars, lawyers, journalists, and government leaders. Here the students will have the opportunity to scrutinize and take or defend positions on issues placed before them. 
This program provides an excellent opportunity for these students to increase their knowledge of our nation's government and legislative procedure. This is an experience that will benefit both these students and the nation, as it provides an excellent hands-on course in preparing our young Americans for future leadership. 
I commend these students from Les Bois High School for this outstanding achievement, and wish them luck in the National competition. I am proud to have them represent the great state of Idaho.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is great to be back from our recess and once again to convene the Senate in the work of the citizens of this country. 
Mr. President, let me, first of all, recognize my colleague from Nebraska and my colleague from Wyoming and, for the record, praise them for the leadership they have demonstrated on the most critical issue that we address here on the floor this morning. Senator Hagel has become the Senate's leader, along with Senator Byrd of West Virginia, on this issue of climate change and trying to convince the Administration, and I think some of our critics, that the course this Administration pursues is not only unrealistic, it really is unjustified. Both Senator Hagel and Senator Enzi, as was recognized by the Senator from Wyoming, were in Kyoto to watch as this Administration negotiated and began to work on some form of protocol. 
I think we three Senators join on the floor this morning proud that during this century our Nation has developed into the strongest economic and military power ever to exist on the face of the Earth. Our democratic system of government, which ensures unparalleled freedom for its citizens, is the envy of the world. All of us in this body are entrusted with the responsibility to protect and enhance that very stature. 
Because I feel so strongly about that responsibility, it is with the most chilling concern that I comment today on the President's contemplated signing of the Kyoto Protocol on Global Climate Change. Despite grave bipartisan warnings from the Congress since the conclusion of the U.N. Global Climate Summit in Kyoto, the President insists on committing our country to an agreement that I believe threatens our way of life; indeed, it threatens the heart of our Nation's power--and the American economy. 
I, like many of my Senate colleagues, am confounded as to why the President is contemplating signing this agreement. I can only hope that it is not simply misguided loyalty to the Vice President, who every American knows is the main protagonist in this ill-conceived campaign to avoid what he calls `an imminent environmental holocaust' caused by global warming. 
Let me repeat those words. Catch the flavor and the emotional ring of `an imminent environmental holocaust.' If anybody stood on the street corner of America and spoke with those terms, surely they would catch the attention of some. When the Vice President speaks in those terms, he catches the attention of many. There is only one problem with that kind of rhetoric. Few, if any, scientists today believe that the world is facing an environmental holocaust from global warming, much less an imminent one. 
In fact, as more and more American scientists review the available data on global warming, it is becoming increasingly clear that the vast majority believe the commitments for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions made by the Administration in the Kyoto Protocol is an unnecessary response to an exaggerated threat--`to an exaggerated threat' that the Vice President himself is caught up in making. Indeed, just today more than 15,000 scientists, two-thirds with advanced academic degrees, released a petition they signed urging the United States to reject the Kyoto Protocol. The petition, expressly states that:  
There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate. 
Mr. President, why must the United States be a party to an agreement that will substantially and negatively affect our economy, change our way of life, and potentially weaken our ability to maintain the world's most powerful military without sufficient scientific evidence of impending doom--sufficient scientific evidence of impending doom? I submit that this Administration has yet to adequately answer that question. The President of the United States, over anyone else in our country, must answer that question. 
Even if we were to ignore the scientific evidence and assume that the world is facing an imminent environmental problem, this agreement does nothing to avoid the threat. Bert Bolin, a Swedish meteorologist and the outgoing chairman of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, recently said that `[t]he Kyoto conference did not achieve much with regard to limiting the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.'--The Washington Post, February 13, 1998 
Therefore, I ask again: Why is the President going to sign this agreement, which, if ratified in its current form, will raise the costs for nearly everything in a typical American budget, in both the short term and long term? 
The Administration has attempted to relieve our economic concerns with a superficial analysis that presents a simplistic view of how American industry can adapt to new economic challenges and includes assumptions about the success of emission trading proposals that are untested in the international arena. This so-called economic analysis is contained in a 20-page paper by Janet Yellen, the Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, submitted as testimony to the House Commerce Committee and the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. 
However, in testimony recently given before the Senate Agriculture Committee examining the Kyoto Agreement, Mary Novak, senior vice president of a respected economic forecasting forum --you have heard of them--called Wharton Econometrics Forecasting Associates, well-known worldwide for its expertise, stated that the Administration's economic analysis of the impact of the Kyoto Agreement is terribly flawed--not possibly flawed, not flawed in limited ways, but terribly flawed. Ms. Novak predicted that the total U.S. cost of meeting the Kyoto Agreement would be $250 billion, or a loss of 3.2 percent of gross domestic product. In addition, Ms. Novak stated that about 2.5 million jobs would be lost, and the annual expense per family would exceed $2,700 a year. 
If the Senate of the United States were, at this moment, contemplating an income tax increase that would increase the average family's taxes by $2,700, and if we passed it, very few, if any, of us would withstand the public outcry, let alone the voters at the ballot box in November. Yet, this President, because he thinks he can hide it through the processes of time and the procedure of international agreement, is proposing just that. That is what the WEFA says--an annual expense per family to exceed $2,700. 
Mr. President, if this administration were sincere about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we would have seen in the President's budget proposal strong support for an array of reliable electric energy that we all know has a benign impact on the very environment that we all cherish and want to protect. Conspicuously absent from the President's Climate Change Technology Initiative was any support for nuclear or hydroelectric power. In fact, the President and the Vice President are hostile to nuclear and hydroelectric power. This very Administration has initiatives that will ultimately grind nuclear energy generation to a halt and would restrict us from any further development of hydro, let alone maintaining the status quo. Yet, both of these sources of power, as we know, do not produce one single molecule of greenhouse gas emissions into our atmosphere. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a cleaner source of power than falling water, or nuclear fission. 
What about the sincerity of this Administration's commitment to our Nation's global competitiveness? 
I was watching television yesterday catching the news shows and talk shows discussing the American economy. Many pundits were concerned about the aggressiveness of the stock market. Well, concerned, yet happy; but will this happiness last? We are surely concerned about the economics of the Pacific rim at this moment; and, nearly every economist on these shows were talking about the power of the current economy of the United States, how it pulls other economies with us, and that we continue to expect growth in the coming year; growth of about 2.5 percent, growth very similar to the kind we had last year. And, while we are talking about that, while we recognize that our competitiveness in the global environment drives the global market, we have an Administration that is tinkering around with the idea of restricting the ability of our country to lead economically and to help out all other nations of the world with their own economic problems. 
Mr. President, our Nation's agricultural industry is one of several industries that will be adversely affected by the requirements of the Kyoto Agreement. American agriculture has evolved with the rapid adoption of new technology; it is both highly capital and energy intensive. Energy use in both direct and indirect ways, including the fuel and lubricants for machinery and vehicles, the natural gas used to dry crops and pump irrigation water, and the electricity used in a wide variety of ways, has caused the American agricultural economy to be the most competitive and the most productive in the world. We use fertilizer and pesticides, all containing large energy components. For these reasons, our agricultural system is very sensitive to the kinds of changes the Vice President and the President are proposing. 
American farmers buy $166 billion worth of inputs and services, sell about $212 billion worth of products and services, and receive just about $54 billion in cash income to cover costs and provide incentives for future investment. Moreover, American agriculture is deeply integrated into the world economy and depends on more than $60 billion in export sales--the fastest growing market for our food and our fiber products. 
That is just one example of an economy in this country that helps set the pace for the world. 
The Kyoto Agreement would cause fertilizer prices to go up, and while the President says carbon taxes are not a part of his plan to meet the treaty's requirements, the administration intends to pressure fossil fuel prices through other ways that would have the impact of burdensome tax increases. One of the results of the Administration's approach to compliance will be higher costs for diesel fuel for trucks and tractors. 
It takes no genius to understand what that means: Increased costs for farmers, which translates into increased costs for food and finished goods at the grocery store. In addition, since most products are delivered by diesel-powered trucks, nearly every item in nearly every store in America will cost more. And all of this will be done by an Administration that pursues a policy which it has no strong scientific or economic basis or logical reason to pursue. 
One of the many potential tragedies of this treaty would be the higher cost of food, not just for those who can afford it but for those who cannot. And remember our Judeo-Christian ethic as a country, the hundreds of millions of dollars of food we send around the world to poor nations, to starving people. Could we afford to send more if it cost more? I doubt it. And yet that is exactly what the President proposes. 
According to Data Resources, Inc., another respected economic forecasting firm, 37 percent of American households have less than $20,000 after-tax income and spend about 21.2 percent to more than 100 percent of after-tax income on food. For these families, the impact of America's compliance with the Kyoto Agreement would be severe and very negative. 
Mr. President, I believe this will be the first time in the history of our country that a President has allowed foreign interests to control and to limit the growth of the American economy. 
Let me repeat that for the record because I believe, after our research, that is a pretty profound statement, not just coming from me but coming from the historic records of our country, that this would be the first time in our history that an American President has allowed foreign interests to control and limit the growth of the American economy. Never before have we allowed foreign interests to dictate the amount of energy Americans can use. 
The Kyoto Agreement requires Americans to cut energy use by the year 2010 to 7 percent below what it was using in 1990. That was just 8 years ago. 
This weekend, I was at a special school out in Idaho, a collection of bright young kids. They are developing an electric car. They are going to race it next week in a race in north Idaho, an electric car. But guess what. You have to use nuclear hydrocarbons to generate the electricity that goes in the battery that powers the car that creates no pollution. 
Get the message. No matter where you turn, whether it is fueling the cars for the great urban areas of our country that might be powered by electricity in the future, that electricity still has to be generated. And a lot of bright people are trying to accomplish that, so we can reduce that kind of impact on our environment. And yet, Mr. President, you are denying the ability to generate the energy by suggesting that we progressively reduce our ability to consume. 
Mr. President, to illustrate the emissions requirement of the Agreement, Jay Hakes, head of the Energy Information Administration--a statistical arm of the Department of Energy--said in 
February testimony before the House Science Committee: `A 7 percent reduction [below baseline levels under the agreement] for energy-related carbon emissions alone would require a reduction of about 550 million metric tons of carbon in 2010, or about 31 percent,' below current projections. According to EIA data, the mark of 550 million metric tons is greater than the total carbon emissions produced by electricity generation in the United States for 1990 or 1996 which were 477 million metric tons and 517 million metric tons, respectively. 
So let me say to all Senators and to the American people, tonight, walk around your house. Think about the light fixture you have just turned on, the appliance you have just turned off, the telephone device you might make a call on, or the computer you will sit down to, to communicate anywhere in the world. Many of these things you have added to your home since 1990. Look at the car you drove home from work. And to the farmer who is out there on the plains and the farmlands of America this very hour, that marvelously efficient diesel tractor that is pulling the plow and the drill to plant the crop that creates the abundant harvest that feeds not just the people of America but the people of the world. All of those tools are a product of energy. In fact, Americans today are consuming more energy as the economy continues to grow, and we will need to consume more. We will need to turn on our lights and our computers. We will need our cars. In the future, they will be better and they will be cleaner, but they still must consume energy. 
The Administration knows this protocol is seriously flawed. In a news conference held in Kyoto, Japan, on December 8, 1997, Vice President Al Gore acknowledged: `We've said from the beginning that, in order to send an agreement to the Senate, we must have meaningful participation by key developing countries.' We now know that developing countries did not sign the agreement. Is it fair to let these countries off the hook while we Americans are subject to such stringent requirements? 
Here's what Stephen L. Miller, President of the Center for Energy and Economic Development had to say about the Kyoto Treaty: `The proposed Kyoto treaty is like a card game where the deck is stacked. American workers are being dealt a losing hand through the negotiating process. In the end, there will be no real environmental benefit and America's working families will be forced to pay higher energy and consumer costs while we export U.S. jobs to countries that are exempted from action under the Treaty.' 
So let us call once again upon our President to incorporate in this agreement developing nations, growth nations like China, Mexico, and India, that have simply walked away because they cannot be a part of an agreement that would cut back on the opportunity they are trying to offer their citizens. 
Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, sign something that is a winning agreement for America. Sign something that promotes our economy, that promotes the environment of the world. Sign something that all countries of the world can agree with. Please do not turn us away from the kind of economic growth and development that all of our citizens expect and demand. There is simply no compelling reason for our government at this time to force Americans to take preventive measures of uncertain competence against a problem that may or may not lie in the Earth's future. 
The Administration carries a heavy burden of persuasion that the CO2 compliance measures contained in the Kyoto Agreement are worth the sacrifice it will require of the American people. We here in the Senate must, and will, ensure that our nation's global economic competitiveness, our nation's military readiness, and our way of life, are not compromised merely to advance misguided political agendas. 
It bears repeating--the Kyoto Agreement is flawed. It is based on politic science and not lab science. And it is only through sound lab science that we, working collectively together with our colleagues around the world, will produce a better world. 
Once again, I thank my colleague from Nebraska for recognizing the importance of this special order this morning as we talk about global climate change and its importance to our country and to our friends and neighbors around the world. 
I note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me say first to the Senators from Arkansas and New Hampshire, this has to be one of the most gratuitous taxes on the mining industry you have yet come up with. 
Let me be blunt, let me be honest: Every citizen benefits from the wealth of the products that flow from mining, and certainly disabled Americans have benefited considerably from light metal technology and advanced computer technology that depends on our mining industry. It has made them mobile. It has made them active. It has changed their lives. 
The Senator from New Hampshire knows better than to say that mining industries don't pay taxes. They are in the 32 percent bracket on the profits of those industries. Everyone knows that, and that kind of statement ought to be taken from the record because it simply is not true. 
What is true is that the mining industry is characterized by relatively rare, commercially valuable metal deposits and mineral deposits. There is high economic risk, geologic unknowns, high capital requirements, and long lead times for the development of the mining companies. We know that, and that is why this Congress years ago provided that depletion allowance, because mining industries invest so much upfront for a resource that is rapidly depleting as they mine it out. 
It recognizes, by this action and by what Congress has already done, unique natural mineral extraction provides for this country the valuable base for our industrial-based economy. It is difficult to replace minerals. Much of the money must be used for exploration and development, millions and millions of dollars upfront, like no other industry that we have seen, only to play in a market that is oftentimes dramatic, in a world market with changing values, and as a result there are dramatic losses and, yes, dramatic profits. But the one thing that is clear and constant across it is a recognition of the constant use or the depletion of the resource that they have discovered. 
I am disappointed that the Senator from Arkansas would try to offset this against disabled people. It just simply doesn't make sense. This Congress has been tremendously responsive to disabled people--the Senator from Arkansas has, the Senator from Idaho and New Hampshire and all of us--and now to play this kind of gratuitous game simply doesn't make a lot of sense.

What the Senator from Arkansas fails to say is he is proposing half a billion dollars in new tax increases on the working men and women of the mining industries. It is not that simple. If you want to vote for a big tax increase, then vote not to table this amendment. But if you want to vote to maintain a strong mining industry in this country that is the foundation of our industrial might, then you ought to vote to table because we are doing the right thing this year. We are funding for the disabled with an additional $2.5 billion. I ask my colleagues to vote to table the amendment.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I reluctantly stand in opposition to the amendment by my colleague from West Virginia. I say that because I appreciate and share with him membership on the Veterans' Committee. So I don't take this opposition lightly. But I recognize its importance because of the broad sense of obligation we have to our veterans community. We in this Nation have elevated veterans and veterans' care to a high standard. That is why it is a Cabinet agency. It didn't just happen by accident. 
We want to care for our veterans. Those men and women who have stood in harm's way for the defense of our freedoms deserve that care, and all of us appreciate the fact that is a great deal. That is why this budget spends $3 billion more over the next 5 years than was assumed in last year's bipartisan budget agreement. That is a true statement of commitment and obligation to our veterans. But this administration and I, and the chairman of the Budget Committee, have very real doubts whether allowing a post-service, smoking-related illness as a part of cash compensation to dependents is the right way to go--at a time certainly when our Veterans' Administration is strapped for cash to meet its current obligations to generate and create a new obligation that is estimated will cost $45 billion over the next 10 years and could reach as high as $10 billion a year by the year 2009. 
That is the reality of what we are talking about. How did we get there? There was a question asked inside the Veterans' Administration whether it was reasonable and right. Could they compensate if this were true? The answer was yes. But the chairman of the Budget Committee is right. Did this Congress authorize it? No; we did not. Can we literally start a new extension of entitlement that could cost $10 billion a year without Congress speaking to it? I hope not. But that is the character of the amendment offered by my colleague from West Virginia. 
I oftentimes do not like to use the argument that maybe we ought to study this. But maybe we ought to understand what we might be walking into. Is it really going to be, by the year 2009, a $10 billion expenditure at a time when our veterans' hospitals may be going unserved or unmodernized or unadministered, at a time when we are trying to strive for outpatient care, at a time when we are trying to build obligations for State-managed and shared veterans' nursing homes for the population of World War II veterans as they grow older and older? If this is the kind of expansion of entitlement we are talking about, how much of the other programs of the Veterans' Administration will we be starving out? 
That is why I have to say no and will oppose the amendment, and hope we can look at the possibility of secondary amendments that would analyze and study to see what this obligation might be. We really do not have the parameters of it. 
In the Veterans' Committee the other day, chaired by my chairman, Senator Specter, there was a general analysis of how they would interpret how they would judge. But, as we know, once you lay down a set of regulations and make arbitrary decisions about who is and who isn't eligible, all it takes is a court test to say, `Wait a moment. You have judged me, my husband's, or my wife's illness improperly although they are deceased and I am entitled.' And the judge says, `Why not? It is the largess of the Treasury. And, by the way, the Veterans' Administration is being arbitrary anyway.' Boom. We have a new expansion of an entitlement because this Congress didn't speak to it and this Congress didn't set the tight parameters necessary when we created new entitlement programs. We allowed an agency and their administrators to interpret and, therefore, 
to judge and, therefore, to define. I believe that is arbitrary. I think all of us do. 
Let me remind you: $10 billion a year by the year 2009 is potentially $45 billion over the next 10 years. That is a big chunk of money.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the chairman of the Budget Committee has explained our intent with this amendment. Let me read it: 
The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Office of Management and Budget and the GAO are jointly required to-- 
jointly study (referred to in this section as the `study') the VA General Counsel's determination and the resulting actions to change the compensation rules. . . 
[and] deliver an opinion as to whether illnesses resulting from post-service smoking should be considered as a compensable disability. 
That is one point. The other point, and I think the most important one that drives this process, that alludes to the potential $10 billion a year, or $45 billion over the next few years, is: 
. . . estimate the numbers of those filing such claims, the cost resulting from such benefits, the time necessary to receive such claims, and how such a number of claims will affect the VA's ability to review its current claim load. 
In other words, this is not a dodge, this is a sincere effort to determine the impact of this potential program, that not one dime has been spent on yet. Are we truly going to 
damage other veterans' programs that are ongoing, that current veterans believe they are owed and, in all right, they are owed? I think we ought to have that information. That is exactly what this study does. 
Does it shove it off for years and years? Not at all. The study concludes that this has to be completed no later than July 1, 1999. And the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Office of Management and Budget and GAO shall report their findings to the majority and the minority leaders of the Senate and the ranking member and the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. 
This is an honest and sincere attempt not to legislate into the dark and to risk $10 billion or $45 billion, and to put in jeopardy current and future ongoing programs of the Veterans Administration, but to have a real understanding of where we might be treading. 
I believe it is responsible, I believe it is right, and I hope my colleagues will join with the chairman of the Budget Committee in support of this second-degree. Let's find out where we are going before we launch on a commitment that we would never be able to walk away from once we created that obligation to veterans. If we truly have dependents out there who start receiving the money, we will never cut it off.

Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, last night I offered an amendment called the Surplus Protection Amendment for myself and several other colleagues here in the Senate: Senator Allard, Senator Coverdell, Senator Grams, Senator Helms, Senator Hutchinson, Senator Inhofe, Senator Sessions, and Senator Thomas. My amendment is a fundamentally simple amendment which sets forth very clearly a new approach toward how we handle mandatory spending. Pay-as-you-go budget enforcement rules were established to help put Washington's fiscal house in order. 
Since fiscal year 1994, the Senate has had a point of order requiring 60 votes to waive against any legislation that would increase the deficit. However, mandatory spending in Washington is Washington's version of a fiscal autopilot. Once enacted, it requires no further congressional action to operate. Rather than a perpetual motion machine, what we have found out with mandatory spending, of course, is that it is a perpetual spending machine. It is, if you will, the Energizer Bunny of budgeting and has kept growing and growing and growing. 
What all this means--and I think it concerns us all greatly--is an increase in mandatory spending must be paid for with a tax increase. Any tax cut must be paid for by a mandatory spending cut. As anyone can tell, pay-go, in its present form, is very insufficient to control mandatory spending. 
Mandatory spending has increased dramatically and will continue to increase dramatically over the next few years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, in 1987 mandatory spending accounted for 47 percent of the Federal budget; in 1997, it accounted for approximately 56 percent; in the year 2008, it will account for 70 percent. Many of us have struggled mightily, as has the chairman of the full committee, to control this. 
What is happening is that mandatory spending is crowding out, rapidly crowding out, Federal Government spending for schools, for roads, for law enforcement, and for those infrastructure maintenance kinds of programs that most citizens in our country feel are legitimate spending areas for our Government. 
I have sensed, as many of my colleagues have, that it is time to make a modest adjustment to try to change the process by which we deal with this issue. Current estimates are that the budget will be balanced this year, and the chairman of the full committee and many colleagues on this floor deserve credit for that because it will be, and we are pleased about it, excited about it, and I think the country is also. It is true that we are nearly 4 years ahead of schedule in balancing the budget, and there is a lot to be credited for that--certainly our ability to begin to control spending here, but also our ability to help free this economy and to see it move as successfully as it has, has been another major contributing factor. 
However, we must look not just to the horizon of spending, as this budget resolution does, but look well beyond it. If we fail to look beyond it, we fail to recognize what is out there in the very, very near future of additional spending as a result of the drive of mandatory entitlement-style spending. To avoid what will happen in the future, I think we have to change the way we work now, because if we don't gradually move into controlling these kinds of spending areas, the step that we would want to take or have to take out there or be forced to take would be uncontrollable-- 
tax increases, major budget cuts of the kind many might find intolerable. What I am proposing is a modest step. I guess I am a bit like a doctor tonight. I am going to suggest that we first pledge to do no harm. What I am offering tonight does no harm to this budget. 
My amendment establishes a point of order that requires new mandatory spending programs to be paid for by mandatory spending savings. In other words, it would require 60 votes in the Senate to create a new mandatory spending program that was not funded by an equivalent mandatory spending savings. Tough choices? Not necessarily. But it forces the Congress to do the work that it probably hasn't liked to do over the years, and that is to do oversight to see whether these programs are working or they ought to be adjusted or changed, and if they are changed, is there something better that we might adjust to? If all of the new mandatory spending programs had been paid for, as we had claimed, we would not be facing a fiscal future of exploding spending and exploding deficits. 
I think anybody who might be listening to what I am saying tonight would be scratching their heads and saying: But, Senator, the budget you are proposing this night is balanced. The budget that the senior Senator from New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee, is offering is at balance, and we are talking about the potential of surplus revenues. 
My point is--and it is a point that nobody disputes--that the current budget path that we are on, which is the right path, is unsustainable. As good as a balanced budget is today, it will not remain a balanced budget for long. The path that we are traveling is no secret that it is unsustainable. It is not. We all know because so many have told us so, including some of our own colleagues here on the floor. Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, who chaired the bipartisan commission on entitlement and tax reforms, has said so. The General Accounting Office has said so. Interestingly enough, the President's budget has said so. And in the most recent report, the Congressional Budget Office said: 
Currently, more than half of the nearly $1.7 trillion in Federal spending goes for entitlements and other mandatory spending programs. As a share of the total outlay, mandatory spending has jumped from 32 percent in 1962 to 56 percent in 1997. If current policies remain unchanged, such spending will continue to grow faster than other spending, reaching 63 percent of total outlays by the year 2002, or twice the size of discretionary outlays. 
Under baseline assumptions, continued growth in mandatory outlays would raise their share of the budget to 70 percent by the year 2008. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office wrote that this year's budgetary news should not lull people into complacency and, most assuredly, this budget, the budget resolution we have before us, should not. It is an excellent work and it controls spending. It gets us to a balanced budget. 
But let me suggest that the retirement of a large baby boomer generation is just over the horizon. If the budgetary pressure from both demographic and health care spending is not relieved by reducing the growth of expenditures or increasing taxes, deficits will mount and seriously erode future economic growth. That report concluded:  
Current budget policy is unsustainable and attempting to preserve it would severely damage the economy. 
How serious are the future projections? The Congressional Budget Office concluded that even if the budget were balanced in the year 2002--and that is our goal and we are going to get there--we would have a deficit equal to 34 percent of the gross domestic product by the year 2050 and the public debt would be 283 percent of the gross domestic product. Those are the outward projections of the current path of expenditure. 
There will be a demographic shift to older populations. This Senator standing before you tonight is part of that group. I am part of that baby boomer crowd. I am going to be one who will be collecting my Social Security and my Medicare. And there is no 
question that, in 1995, there were 34 million 65-year-old and older citizens. But by the year 2030, there will be twice that number, or 68 million. There will be more elderly. They will live longer and they will be using Federal services more intensively. There will be relatively fewer workers around to put foot all of these bills. If we don't sense that now--and several sense-of-the-Senate resolutions have talked about it today, but my amendment changes the process, forces the issue, causes us to work our way through these kinds of tough decisions. 
In 1950, there were 7.3 workers for every senior. In 1990, there were 4.8 workers for every one senior. In 2030, there will be 2.8. We all know the reality of that. What I am talking about are the taxpayers paying into the programs that will fund that one individual. It will take all 2.8 of those workers working together at a very large chunk--a 60-plus percent tax rate on their income to fund that one individual, along with all the other Government services and necessary programs that we think are appropriate. 
So what the demographic shift means is that spending rises very rapidly relative to revenue. Quoting the Congressional Budget Office: 
Revenues will be squeezed as the number of people working and the economy grows slower. At the same time, outlays for Government programs that aid the elderly will burgeon as the number of people eligible to receive benefits from these programs will shoot up. 
What the fiscal squeeze means is major new revenues in the form of taxes or enormous deficits. The deficit, last year, was less than 1 percent of GDP. It would be 29.8 percent by the year 2030. The Federal debt was 50 percent of GDP last year; it would be 250 percent by the year 2035. Those are not my numbers; that is the Congressional Budget Office speaking. Those are valid numbers, and anybody who studies the budget curves understands that. This is unprecedented. We have never had a period of time in our country's history where these numbers became reality, because we never have spent that much of the gross domestic product of our country. The deficit has been higher than 10 percent of GDP only briefly, during major wars. And we understand those reasons--when our Nation is at risk and our freedoms are to be secured. The debt exceeded 100 percent only once and that was during World War II. The result would be based on the figures by the year 2035 of economic catastrophes. I don't know of any other way to explain it, any other way to compare it. Those would be the realities. Even to make the burden sustainable, the Congressional Budget Office terminology allowing debt to rise, but keeping constant in relation to the gross domestic product, would have dire consequences. The tax burden would have to increase 20 percent just to continue running deficits and adding debt. 
Of course, someone will say that the budget agreement solves the problem. No, the budget agreement doesn't solve the problem. It addresses the immediate, it addresses the desire to maintain current spending while mandatory spending within this continues to grow at the rates offered in these projections that brings us to the year 2035. It is certainly an improvement, and I am very laudatory of the chairman of the Budget Committee, and others. It delays the scenario I have just outlined. But according to the CBO, if the budget is balanced through the year 2010--and that is what I believe this Congress strives to do--it will take less than 15 years to reach the same scenario that I have just described--a huge deficit and a debt of 230 percent of gross domestic product by that time. Quoting the Congressional Budget Office: 
Regardless of how the budget is balanced in the near term, congressional budget action would still be needed to put the budget on a sustainable path. 
So what I am proposing is a modest first step. The years 2030 to the year 2050 are not real to us on this floor. We cannot even begin to appreciate the kinds of budget numbers those years will produce. But they are very real to our children or any child that might be in the galleries tonight, because they are the ones who will be paying that huge tax rate out there to fund these kinds of programs that we have already put in progress today. So those are the realities of what we are dealing with. My amendment is a first step in that direction.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues tonight to vote with me to waive the Budget Act. It is the first step to reigning in the uncontrolled costs to mandatory spending programs. Your vote tonight merely extends the same treatment to mandatory spending that already exists to annually appropriated discretionary spending; that new programs will offset with savings in existing programs; that mandatory spending is out of control--we all know that. 
While this is a balanced budget in the outyears of 2020, and 2035, we will be looking at spending up to 200 plus percent of the gross domestic product. 
The Craig amendment will not affect a single current beneficiary of a single existing program. The Craig amendment will not affect a single person who will qualify to become a beneficiary under current entitlement programs. 
We need to start with a single, simple, first step, toward reigning in mandatory spending. An aye vote starts us in that direction.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as I debate this amendment this evening, let me first recognize my colleague from Colorado, who has just brought before the Senate an almost unbelievable proposal. I say that because it is difficult for us to fathom a savings of $3.7 trillion to the American taxpayer and to future generations in this Nation by taking it upon ourselves to pay down the Federal debt over a 30-year period. I am proud to support my colleague from Colorado. It is these kinds of initiatives that I think reflect to the American people that we really are sincere about getting the spending habits of this Government, and the debt we have accumulated over the last good number of years, under control. It is also very reflective of the kind of impact that controlling deficits and debts has on our economy and on our future generations. 
So, in my offering of the amendment this evening, I am proud the Senator from Colorado has joined me along with Senator Helms, Senator Hutchison, Senator Inhofe, Senator Grams, and Senator Thomas. Mine is a similar measure to once again shape the spending habits of this Congress. My amendment is entitled the `Surplus Protection Amendment,' because it does just that; it protects the surplus from irresponsible spending. 
Current budget policy as we know it, pay-as-you-go--so-called PAYGO--budget enforcement rules were established to help put Washington's fiscal house in order. Since fiscal year 1994, the Senate has had a point of order requiring 60 votes to waive against any legislation which would result in mandatory spending increases that would increase the deficit. Mandatory spending in Washington's version of a fiscal autopilot. Once enacted, it requires no further congressional action to operate. And we know that. We see it happening right here. It is a part of this budget resolution. Rather than a perpetual motion machine, mandatory spending is a perpetual spending machine. It is the Energizer Bunny of budgeting, and it has kept this budget growing and growing and growing. 
What does all of this mean? Any increase in mandatory spending must be paid for with a tax increase, and any tax cut must be paid for by a mandatory spending cut. We wonder why taxes are high. We wonder why it is so difficult to cut taxes. Those are the reasons. As anyone can tell, PAYGO--that is what we call this provision in its present form--isn't sufficient. Mandatory spending has increased dramatically and will continue to increase dramatically as far as any of us can sense it. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, in 1987, mandatory spending accounted for 47 percent of the Federal budget. In 1997, it accounted for 56 percent of the Federal budget, and in the year 2008 under this budget resolution, it will account for about 70 percent of the total Federal budget. 
Now remember, that is the portion that is on auto pilot; that is the portion that just keeps growing and growing and growing. This means that there has been and will increasingly be a crowding out of what the Federal Government can spend on schools, on roads, on law enforcement, and some of those fundamental things that keep our country operating in a civil way, the kind of things for which historically our Government was envisioned to have a responsibility. 
I believe because of that it is time that we try to make a change. Current estimates are that the budget will be balanced this year, and the budget chairman, my colleague from New Mexico, the senior Senator who has done such a marvelous job shaping and nurturing and bringing this balanced budget along, is going to see that that happens. We are going to help him, and of that we are proud. 
As far as we can see out there, we are 4 years ahead of schedule on balancing the budget, and I applaud it. I am proud to have been a part of it, and I think it is wonderful for the American people, for our economy, for job creation and all that that means. The Senator from New Mexico can be rightfully proud of it, and I know he is. However, we must look not just at the horizon of the current budget, but we ought to look beyond it, beyond the 4 years. I know we can't get beyond it in the budget process, but we can get beyond it in the policy. We can get beyond it in how we operate moving toward the future. 
To avoid what will happen in the future, we must change the way we work now. I am proposing, as a modest first step, that like a good doctor, we first pledge to do no harm, and I believe my modest first step does no harm. 
My surplus protection amendment establishes a point of order that requires new mandatory spending programs be paid for by mandatory spending savings. Let me repeat that. 
My amendment establishes a point of order that requires new mandatory spending programs be paid for by mandatory spending savings. In other words, it would require 60 votes in the Senate to create a new mandatory spending program that was not funded by an equivalent mandatory spending savings. 
If all of the new mandatory spending programs had been paid for, as we had claimed, we would not be facing a fiscal future with exploding spending and exploding deficits in the outyears. 
Why does this Senate and this country need the Craig amendment? I think the current budget path that the Senator from New Mexico and all of us have worked so hard on is truly unsustainable. As good as a balanced budget today is, without ever more fundamental changes, it will not remain balanced. And it ought to be our goal to at least strive to maintain a balanced budget. 
That this path is unsustainable is no secret. We all know because of what we have been told by so many. My colleague, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, who chaired the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform has said that is impossible to do. The General Accounting Office says we cannot sustain a balanced budget under our current scenario, and the President's own budget office says so. 
In its most recent report, the Congressional Budget Office states:  
Currently, more than half of the nearly $1.7 trillion in Federal spending goes for entitlements and other mandatory programs (other than net interest) . . . As a share of total outlays, mandatory spending has jumped from 32 percent in 1962 to 56 percent in 1997. If current policies remain unchanged, such spending will continue to grow faster than other spending, reaching 63 percent of total outlays by the year 2002--or twice the size of discretionary 
outlays. Under baseline assumptions, continued growth in mandatory outlays would raise their share of the budget to 70 percent by the year 2008. 
Last year, the Congressional Budget Office wrote: 
[T]his year's budgetary news should not lull people into complacency: the retirement of the large baby-boom generation is just over the horizon-- 
Just beyond where this budget and all of us can see-- 
. . .If the budgetary pressure from both demography and health care spending is not relieved by reducing the growth of expenditures or increasing taxes, deficits will mount and seriously erode future economic growth. 
That is the reality of what we deal with. That report concluded, Mr. President: 
[C]urrent budget policy is unsustainable, and attempting to preserve it would severely damage the economy. 
How serious are future projections? The Congressional Budget Office concluded that even if the budget were balanced through 2002--and that is our goal, that is the goal of this budget--if that were true, we would still have a deficit equal to 34 percent of the gross domestic product by the year 2050 and the public debt would be 283 percent of the gross domestic product. 
There will be a demographic shift to an older population. We all know that. The experts show us that. I am part of that. I am a baby boomer. 
In 1995, there were 34 million 65-year-old, or older, citizens. In the year 2030, there will be twice that number or 68 million. There will be more elderly. They will be living longer and using Federal services much more intensively. There will be relatively fewer workers around to pay all the bills. Let us remember that it is the current working population that generates the economy that pays the bills. 
In 1950, there were 7.3 workers for every senior. In 1990, there were 4.8 to 1 senior. In the year 2030, there will be 2.8 workers per every 1 senior. 
So if that senior is receiving well over $1,000 a month in Social Security benefits and maybe health care benefits, who is paying for it? Those 2.8 workers. Divide it up. Count it out. It is pretty obvious how much has to come out of their wages on a monthly basis to transfer it to that senior's well-being. 
What the demographic shift means is that spending will rise rapidly relative to revenues. Quoting the Congressional Budget Office: 
Revenues will be squeezed as the number of people working--and the economy--grows more slowly. At the same time, outlays for Government programs that aid the elderly will burgeon as the number of people eligible to receive benefits from those programs shoots up. 
What the fiscal squeeze means, if we don't begin to recognize it now, is enormous deficits. Just at a time when we thought the deficit battle was over, when this Congress has battled through to get to a balanced budget, where we are now, all of a sudden this begins to dramatically shift. We know it will happen because the facts, the figures and the spending programs are already in law. 
The deficit last year was less than 1 percent of the gross domestic product of our country. In 2035 it would be 29.8 percent. Let me repeat that. The deficit by the year 2035 will be 29.8 percent of the gross domestic product if we don't begin to shape it down and scale it down. 
The Federal debt was 50 percent of the gross domestic product last year. Now we are talking about debt. It would be 250 percent by the year 2035. These are not my figures. These are the projections of the professionals, the budget professionals--the Congressional Budget Office and others--who look at the long term, who put on the binoculars and look over the horizon to see what our spending programs must yield to benefit the citizens who are living today who will be recipients of those benefits in the year 2035. 
Those figures I have given you are truly unprecedented. We have never had to deal with them before as a percentage of the gross domestic product of this country. The deficit has been higher than 10 percent of GDP, but only briefly and during a major war. Not during peace times, not during prosperity, but at a time when we were fighting for the safety and the security of this country. 
The debt exceeded 100 percent only once, briefly during World War II. The results, if we were to continue to do this with these projections I have just given you, would be economic catastrophe. Even to make the burden sustainable, in CBO's terminology, allowing debt to rise but keeping it at a constant to the gross domestic product rate would have dire consequences. In other words, we can't just sustain where we are. We have to begin to back away from where we are and do so over an extended period of time. The tax burden would have to increase 20 percent above where it is today just to continue running deficits and adding debt. 
Of course, some will say that this budget agreement solves the problem. I wish it did. It solves the problem in the short term, and for that we are proud. For that all of us who vote for it and support it and support the chairman in what he is bringing before us ought to be proud. We have a right to be. But it is within the short term. It is in the foreseeable future. 
It is certainly an improvement, but it only delays the same scenario that I have just sketched out. According to the CBO, even if the budget is balanced through the year 2010--and that is the Congressional Budget Office speaking--it will take less than 15 years to reach the scenario that I have just projected, and that is a debt that consumes over 250 percent of the gross domestic product of this country. 
The Congressional Budget Office states:  
Regardless of how the budget is balanced in the near term, additional budgetary action. . .would still be needed to put the budget on a sustainable path. 
I am offering, as I said, a modest first step. The year 2030 and the year 2050 are unreal to any of us on this floor. But if there are any young people in the galleries tonight, it is their budget. It will be their Government. It will be their responsibility to run it. And it will be their responsibility to pay for it. The Congressional Budget Office paints such an alarming picture that even the authors cannot imagine it, and they write this: 
Policymakers would surely take action before the economy was driven to such dire straits. 
So even those who analyze it are willing to say surely those of us--that's me, that's you, Mr. President--as policymakers would never allow this to happen. But we are not taking steps to change it. We are dealing in the short term, and we have to deal in the short term first. For that I have already applauded the chairman and the ranking member, but we have to do more. 
Now is the time for us at least to prepare for such an action. My amendment takes this first modest step that we do no fiscal harm to our children, like a good doctor would. 
The first frightening thing in the CBO report is that it only addresses existing programs. It makes plain that our children cannot afford them. The existing programs are not now and will not in the future be paid for by our taxes. We certainly cannot responsibly add more. 
Regrettably, the President's budget adds more: $28 billion in new mandatory spending, $118 billion in total new spending, and $43 billion less in surplus that would be saved for Social Security as the President himself has called for. 
My amendment will not affect a single beneficiary for a single existing program. My amendment will not even affect anyone who would be qualified in the future for one of these programs. My amendment will not prevent a tax increase in order to reduce deficits. And my amendment will not even prevent a new spending program if a new program is so important that there is a supermajority, 60 votes in this body, to bring about a new spending program. This amendment should appeal to everyone serious about deficits. It will merely make sure that there is an overwhelming demand for a new program before we create it. 
These are shared goals. By all 66 who supported the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution last year. By even those who opposed it because it included Social Security. For whatever purpose people want to use the surplus, they must first be protected. My amendment not only protects them now but will for the future. Because mandatory spending has historically failed to adhere to estimates, we must offset new mandatory spending with mandatory savings. 
Good-faith first steps are something that we should all come together on. So I urge my colleagues to take a look into the future to recognize those figures that are very real, that no one disputes, whether it is the President's budget estimators or whether it is our Congressional Budget Office. My amendment is a modest first step to look beyond the horizon of a balanced budget, to recognize that our current spending programs produce deficits and debts in the future that we have not yet devised a method to respond to. And I would suggest, Mr. President, that my amendment would attempt to do just that. 
With that, I have spoken about this issue all that I would care to tonight. I would be happy to reserve the balance of my time if no one else wishes to speak to this issue this evening.

Mr. CRAIG. Let me thank the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee for those remarks. I think they are candid and appropriate to the very essence of my own that, at a time when we have an opportunity to begin to shape control over mandatory spending, we ought to take a look at this time, and we can do that in a unique period in our Nation's history which we all fought to get to. So I thank my colleague for those comments. 
I ask to retain the balance of my time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will be brief. Others are gathered here to speak on the Hutchison amendment. 
But let me first of all recognize the Senator from Texas for highlighting and bringing to the surface an issue that is growing in the minds of many of us and we hope will alert the minds of many Americans. 
We were engaged here for a week on the debate on the expansion of NATO. This Senate more than likely will vote to expand NATO in the course of this session. But as we do, we ought to remember the consequence or the potential impact of that kind of a vote. And I think it is reflected in this drifting policy that we have currently in Bosnia. 
Peacekeeping operations so designated by our President are important and should be well defined. But I will tell you, the Senator from Texas is right. Our President operates in an unauthorized situation in Bosnia today. The Senator from Oklahoma has brought up the mounting costs. We are able to measure some $8 billion in costs. We know they are much larger than that. 
The mission appears at date to be endless as it relates to some culmination. Do we have to lose American men and women in Bosnia before our citizens wake up or, more importantly, the Congress begins to move with its constitutional authority to deal directly with this issue? I hope not. 
The mission in Bosnia is now just what we were promised it would not be. We were promised it would not be an unauthorized, open-ended, nation-building deployment with no withdrawal criteria. It is now all of those things by definition. 
In 1995, President Clinton vowed that the U.S. troops deployed to Bosnia `should and will take about one year.' Three years and nearly $8 billion later, the administration now admits, `We do not propose a fixed end date for the deployment.' 
This unauthorized, open-ended deployment is affecting the readiness of our troops, their morale. Some anecdotal evidence is clearly available if you scratch the surface. 
Increasingly, Army and Air Force units put off combat training because they are too busy with low-intensity missions, and they need the money elsewhere. We see that great shift of dollars underneath the surface that this administration has been unwilling to admit. And, finally, just in the last month, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee said we will do no more of that. Following this supplemental, the administration must now bring to the Hill as an authorization the appropriate expenditures for the mission in Bosnia. 
Another anecdotal piece of evidence: A particular Marine expeditionary unit deploys more than 220 days in a 365-day period as if we were at war. That is how we are using our men and women in uniform today. 
Air Force pilots are fleeing to the commercial sector despite cash incentives from the Air Force of up to $22,000 to reenlist. We all know the kind of investment we have in these pilots--millions of dollars of training and, of course, operational time. 
There are serious problems that the President is turning a blind eye on so he can continue to deploy troops to humanitarian missions. If we are going to declare humanitarian missions in our national interest, then let us declare them. Let us come to Congress and get the constitutional authorization necessary for those kinds of actions. Let us appropriate the money accordingly instead of slip money and the necessary resources away from certain missions to other missions of the kind that we have talked about. 
Meanwhile, there are fewer dollars for defense and increasing orders to deploy. 
Since 1989, manpower has been cut by nearly one-third, the number of missions has quadrupled, and defense spending has been dramatically reduced. 
This year's defense budget marks the fourteenth consecutive year of decline for defense spending. 
President Clinton's $270 billion 1999 defense budget represents a real decline of 1.1 percent from current spending levels, and marks a 39-percent drop from the spending levels of the mid-1980's. 
While defense spending declines, the U.S. military has been asked to do more. Since 1990, U.S. Armed Forces have been used in 36 major foreign missions, compared to 22 between 1980 and 1989. 
The commitment of United States troops to Bosnia is a commitment of United States blood. The decision to place United States troops in harm's way is a commitment that I do not take lightly. The President not only broke his promise to have our troops home by December 1996, he has also decreased the readiness of our troops by taking scarce dollars from an underfunded defense budget and used them to defend causes that have little to do with our national security interest. 
I hope my colleagues will support Senator Hutchison's amendment which will allow for an honorable exit of U.S. troops from the region, and turn over the operation to our European allies. 
That is why it is time to debate this issue. I am proud that the Senator from Texas brings it to us, highlights it, gets it on the national agenda, not just the agenda of Congress and this Senate, but brings it forth for a national agenda. I thank my colleague for doing so. 
Mr. President, I stand in support of this amendment.  
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator McConnell and Senator Hagel for the work they have done on reform issues tied with this most critical IMF funding. I must tell you that at the outset I was not a champion of the idea that we bail out anybody--and I am still not. But clearly what we have done here is say to the IMF and to nations who would benefit from their loans that there needs to be the establishment of some clear-cut rules that impact loaning policies and the economy of those countries. 
My colleague from Idaho has just spoken to an issue that I think so clearly demonstrates why we need to do what we need to do. Senator Kempthorne and I, for the last several years, have worked in my State with a company that has fought overwhelming odds. They fought a major government of a growing economic power --the Korean Government--and a major industry in Korea. Why? Because of a very cozy relationship between this industry and its government to build an extremely large and excessive capacity to dominate a world market and, therefore, substantially underbid in the market the efficiencies of this company that was leading the world in technology and productivity. We should not allow this nor should we allow the taxpayers of this country to be a part in this bailing out. 
Well, we are no longer doing that. We are making a major move to create transparency in the relationships that governments and their banking institutions and private industry in those countries have. That is what will strengthen the Asian economy. That is what will disallow the kind of Asian flu that currently exists, when we can work on equal footing, when all are treated relatively equal in a growing global economy. 
That is what strengthens what the Senate is doing today. And clearly, the amendments that Senator McConnell and Senator Hagel and others have worked on will do just that in bringing about reforms. The United States must have a major voice in this issue. 
The IMF and our support of it can, in fact, be that voice to bring about uniformity around the world for all citizens of the world, and certainly the citizens of our country, the banking institutions of our country, but most importantly, the private industry of our country which without Government support and without Government subsidy must compete in a world market where that subsidy and support exists. 
So I thank my colleagues for working jointly together to accomplish what I think these amendments, included with the IMF funding, will accomplish.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am filing an amendment related to the resolution of ratification for the proposed expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
Last May, President Clinton publicly embraced the idea of a `new NATO' mission. It is my concern that the President's vision of a new NATO will signal the end of NATO as a defensive alliance and begin its role as a regional peacekeeping organization. The President declared: 
We are building a new NATO. It will remain the strongest alliance in history, with smaller, more flexible forces, prepared to provide for our defense, but also trained for peacekeeping. It will work closely with other nations that share our hopes and values and interests through the Partnership for Peace. It will be an alliance directed no longer against a hostile bloc of nations, but instead designed to advance the security of every democracy in Europe--NATO's old members, new members, and non-members alike. 
I cannot support the President's call for a new NATO to be the de facto regional peacekeeper in Europe. President Clinton's peacekeeping operation in Bosnia has been going on for more than two years, without authorization from Congress, with costs mounting far above every estimate, and with mission end-dates repeatedly broken. The mission in Bosnia is now just what we were promised it would not be: an unauthorized, open-ended, no end-date, nation building deployment with no withdrawal criteria. 
In 1995, President Clinton vowed that the U.S. troop deployed to Bosnia `should and will take about one year.' Three years, and $8 billion later, the Administration now admits `we do not propose a fixed end date for the deployment.' Will the expansion of NATO be a green light for other unauthorized, open-ended, and cost missions for the U.S.? 
Today I am filing an amendment which provides that before the President can deposit the instruments of ratification for NATO expansion he must receive authorization for the Bosnia mission. Let me be clear on one point: this is NOT a `war power' amendment. This does not say he cannot continue the deployment in Bosnia without authorization, nor does it cut off funds for that mission, nor does it set an end-date for that mission, nor does it establish withdrawal criteria. It does, however, require the President to cooperate with Congress to set reasonable parameters for that mission before he gets a blank check--like a `new NATO '--for more just out of area, out of Article 5 missions. 
Membership in NATO is a commitment of U.S. blood. This is a responsibility that I do not take lightly. For the sake of our men and women serving in this dangerous and volatile region, the mission in Bosnia ought to be authorized by Congress.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am filing an amendment to the resolution of ratification for the proposed expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
As the Senate begins debate about expansion, I think it is fair to say that most Senators--whether they favor, oppose, or are undecided about the proposed treaty revision--can all agree that the issue of cost to the U.S. taxpayer is of great concern. Unfortunately, these costs are yet to be determined. The Administration claims the NATO expansion bill for the U.S. will be approximately $1 billion. On the other hand, the Congressional Budget Office contends it will cost taxpayers $125 billion. Given the enormous discrepancy between the estimates, it only makes sense that we know what actual costs will be before we make an irrevocable decision to enlarge NATO. 
I would like to commend the Foreign Relations Committee for their fine work in crafting language detailing American cost obligations to NATO. However, there seems to be one problem: all of this cost related information will be made available to Congress only after the Senate's advice and consent to expansion is final and irrevocable. That means if the information is not satisfactory to the Senate, we will have no recourse. 
The amendment I am filing simply provides that the Congress has the fullest possible information as to what we will pay for, before we commit to the United States to this tremendous political and economic decision by requiring a Senate vote of approval related to cost, benefits, burden-sharing, and military implications of NATO enlargement prior to the President depositing the instruments of ratification.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, America always rises to a challenge. We meet challenges readily and directly and would never ignore one knowingly as a country. 
Therefore, it is not surprising that the greatest threat facing our Nation today would be the least visible. It is invisible because it originates behind our defenses. It does not come from a foreign country; it comes from our own. While it directly threatens our well-being, it dares not confront us directly. It uses Americans' good will and generosity against them. All of this serves to make the threat more insidious and more dangerous. 
Mr. President, the greatest threat facing America today is excessive taxation and with it a Washington culture that has transformed excessive into acceptable. 
By any estimation, America's tax burden is excessive. Washington is projected to take $1.68 trillion in taxes this year. No government in history has ever collected that much from its citizens. As an overall burden, that $1.7 trillion amounts to 20.1 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product. One-fifth of everything produced in this country is consumed by this city, this Government, Washington, DC. That one-fifth is the highest overall tax burden since World War II, when America had committed itself to a total effort to win the greatest war in mankind's history. 
Even then, under those most serious of circumstances, the tax burden placed on the Nation was only slightly larger than it is today. That burden lasted for just 2 years, 1944 and 1945. When the war was done, then the taxes returned to normal because this Congress made that happen because at that time we had not slipped into the culture of excessive taxation. 
In contrast, today's tax burden shows no signs of ever ending, to the point that excessive taxation has come to be accepted as normal. Even after the tax cuts of last year have been fully implemented by the year 2003, the overall Federal tax burden will still amount to 19.5 percent, still one-fifth of everything produced in this country. The burden will still be higher than all but 2 years following World War II: 1969, when America was involved in war, and in 1981, when America was being wracked by runaway inflation. 
Today we no longer see the specter of Hitler stalking across Europe; today we no longer are fighting in the jungles of Southeast Asia; today there is no runaway inflation; but today, and even more sadly, tomorrow, America is saddled with the same tax burden that used to be reserved only for calamities of the magnitude I have just spoken of. 
Today's calamity is the tax burden itself. What once was effect is now cause. Let me repeat that: What once was effect is now cause. Last year Federal, State and local taxes took 38.2 percent of the income of the median two-earner family. It is bad enough that Washington, DC, takes one-fifth of what America produces. But it is intolerable that we are party to, and the principal cause of, taking two-fifths from America's families. 
These are not just abstract numbers, folks. Meaningless? Not at all. They are not just something that someone with a green eyeshade or a calculator came up with. These are real dollars taken from real families who could spend them, save them, invest them in real things. The median dual-earning American family pays 
$22,521--that is $15,400 to Washington alone. That is more than they pay in food costs, for housing, for clothing, or for medical care--combined. That is more than they have ever paid, and they must now work longer and harder than ever to pay it. It is no wonder that two must work when it takes two-fifths of a couple's earnings just to pay their taxes. In fact, one of those two working parents virtually is working entirely for Washington, DC, every day and every hour that spouse spends working, so that Washington politicians can simply spend and spend and spend. 
Americans do not think it is fair, only Washington does. In a recent poll, 89 percent of Americans thought that the total tax burden for a family of four should not be any higher than 25 percent. That would mean Washington would still get a bigger portion of the family's earnings than each member of the family. Again, that's a statement worth repeating. Even with that figure, Washington still gets more of the money earned from the family than each member of the family gets. 
Americans are a generous people and they thought it was fair that Washington get only 25 percent. Sadly, Washington, DC, does not. Without any war, any disaster, and with times good, Washington demands more than it ever has. Where will the money come from in the time of disaster then? Washington cannot afford a disaster, because America can now no longer afford Washington. 
Somewhere along the way, the Federal Government lost its way. Washington has quietly and insidiously subverted the normal relationship that should exist between a state and a free people. Where excessive tax burdens were once relegated to abnormal circumstances, Washington now sees excessive as normal. Where wealth was once considered the property of those who created it, Washington now sees it as the property of those who tax it. Tax dollars have become Washington's dollars--not the rightful property of those from whom they are excessively taken, but the inalienable property of those to whom they are delivered. Only in Washington, DC, can a tax cut cause indignation, moral outrage that there exist people so selfish that they would dare to think their claim on their own earnings is more just than the claims of the bureaucrats and the politicians who wish to spend it. 
It is not Washington's money. It is not Washington's money. Not one cent of it. It belongs to those who make it. We are not entitled to it. We are merely its stewards. Our claim to it does not outweigh that of those who earn it, their spouses, their children, their families. 
Nor is it just money. To those who did not work for it, it is not real. They see it as a child might, understanding neither its origin nor its limits. What we diminish by calling it `taxes' is the work, the time, the property, the sacrifice and the very dreams of those who earn it for themselves and their families. It is what is taken when Washington taxes excessively. 
That people have a fundamental right to their time, their work and their property--none of us would deny this, and none of us would support a system whereby these things were taken. If the Nation commandeered an individual's time, it would rightfully be called a police state. In fact, when an individual's time is taken by imprisonment, it is in fact a police action that takes it. We ended the draft because we thought it was unfair to lay claim to a young man's life when there was no emergency of war facing this Nation. Yet, when the subject is money, Washington demands its portion even in the absence of an emergency. 
Excessive taxation is no less than confiscation. When the Federal Government takes more than its share, it forces others to pay more than their share. What crime have those committed who are able to pay, that they can be taxed and taxed and taxed? They are guilty of nothing but success, of supporting themselves, of having created jobs for others, of having saved so that others might borrow and open businesses and create yet more jobs. In 1995 the top one-half of earners paid 95.4 percent of the total income tax of this country. 
Is it any wonder, then, when we have so subverted the system that excess is normal and that the product of a person's labor is rightfully Washington's, that we have heinous abuses by the IRS? They cannot be excused, but perhaps partially explained, by the development of a culture that has come to see success as an indictment. 
Excessive taxation is immoral. The power to tax is the power to destroy. Yet, when Daniel Webster and Chief Justice John Marshall said it, they could not have known how right they really were. The power to tax not only has the potential to destroy those who are taxed but also, in a much more subtle way, the recipient as well. 
The American people demanded welfare reform not because they are mean-spirited, but because they recognize that no system can succeed that separates money from work. Nor should it. To an American, it is no less than immoral to get something for nothing. Washington finally recognized this in the case of welfare, but Washington has yet to apply that same principle to itself and to its taxes. 
By separating revenue from the work and the success that created it, Washington comes to take money for granted. It begins to be more concerned with those who receive Government programs than with those who are actually paying for them. And in the ultimate travesty, it comes to stigmatize those who, by their hard work and success, can afford to pay. 
In short, Washington becomes morally weakened by indolence, as does someone who lives perpetually on someone else's work. It begins to take both the tax and the taxpayer for granted and, ultimately, it has come to resent the taxpayer as well. 
Just as the power to tax is the power to destroy, so the reverse is true as well. The power to cut taxes is the power to create, to create higher wages, more and better jobs, homes, businesses, savings and investments. 
In a free society and a free market, people decide where they want their money to go, and it will go where it will be most efficiently used. Raising taxes circumvents this process. Cutting taxes reinvigorates it. 
Cutting taxes is not simply about leaving money with the individuals who created it, it is about leaving opportunities in communities. Washington spent more than $5 trillion in constant 1993 dollars on welfare in the 30 years between 1965 and 1994. That figure is roughly the size of the entire national debt today. Yet, there was never a Federal program that could give an individual what Main Street America does day after day after day, and that is a meaningful job, a job that exists strictly because someone, under no compulsion, thought it was worthwhile to hire that person. No Government program can replace by giving what an employee earns by working. 
Cutting taxes will put money not only where it belongs morally--with those who earned it--but where it belongs economically--into the Nation's economy. With this spur, the growth we need to meet our future commitments would be at hand. Money going to Washington today will do less to prepare us for our future than money staying with America's earners. If the people knew enough to create the wealth in the first place, why then should Washington know best what to do with it? 
Finally, cutting taxes is necessary. We have the highest peacetime tax burden on the largest economy the world has ever known, and it still cannot support our current programs in the near future. Every credible analyst, both inside and outside of Government, knows that we cannot afford our entire entitlement programs tomorrow. Only politicians disagree. President Clinton's latest budget, according to CBO, contains $128 billion in new spending. If we cannot afford today's programs tomorrow, how can we seriously consider adding more? We must first reform what we have. 
In just 14 years, Social Security taxes will be unable to pay for benefits. The cost of both Medicare and Medicaid will shoot up. Tax increases will not possibly be able to pay for tomorrow's exploding costs without imploding the Nation's economy. If we follow the tax-hike route, we will not only not solve our problem, we will exacerbate it as slower economic growth leads to increased Federal costs. 
In short, tax hikes are a treadmill to oblivion. That is why 
I offered an amendment last year to require a supermajority in the Senate in order to raise taxes to pay for new spending. 
Instead of tax hikes tomorrow, we need to cut taxes today. We need to begin preparing the economic foundation now for a time when the ratio of workers paying taxes to the retirees receiving benefits is smaller than at any time in our Nation's history. This means increasing economic growth, and that means increasing investment. 
Investment does not come from Government, it comes from millions of men and women savings and from hundreds of thousands of businesses adding new equipment, things that cannot happen if the money needed for savings and investment in America is being consumed for spending right here in this city. 
Taxes are excessive. Excessive taxes are confiscatory. This confiscation by excessive taxation is immoral, both because of what it does to the person for whom excessive taxes are taken, and also because of what it does to the recipient. 
Excessive taxes are bad for the economy, and excessive taxes are unsustainable because of the fiscal path now charted by existing spending programs. In the face of this overwhelming evidence, what do the defenders of tax-and-spend-welfare state offer in return? The only thing they can: good intentions. But good intentions are not enough. Would you excuse those who deny you your money, your time, your property, the things you earned for your family, just because their intentions were good? 
Would you excuse those who denied basic common sense just because they meant well? Of course not. But we find ourselves too often paralyzed by the good intentions of counterfeit compassion, a compassion that argues there is never enough of other people's money to pay for their good wishes, a compassion that holds there is nothing so noble as a gift from the Government and something suspicious about those who succeed on their own. 
Good intentions should not be allowed to excuse Washington's indolence when it claims it cannot cut, that it cannot reform, that it cannot restrain the growth of programs it created so that people can keep more of what they have earned. Nor should Washington be allowed to say it cannot reform when it really means it will not reform. 
Washington will not reform because it imagines that it knows better, better than the tens of millions of taxpayers, workers, employers, savers and investors, but Washington, ladies and gentlemen, is wrong. 
Instead, Washington should be made to answer this very simple question: Why should those who did not earn, did not save and did not invest the money be more entitled to the returns it generates than those who did? 
We must finally say to Washington what Washington has been saying to taxpayers for decades: Sacrifice a little bit. We must fundamentally change how the Tax Code works. It can no longer be allowed to penalize people. It should not feed off of the system. It should offer rewards. And that is what we must recognize. We can no longer have a Tax Code that treats success as a crime to be punished instead of a goal to be emulated. We can argue over what would be the best tax reform, but we must agree that most suggestions for reform would do better than we are doing now with the current Tax Code. 
We must simplify the system. It is bad enough that Washington takes more than it should without the additional insult of confusion. Last year, Americans spent $230.4 billion just complying with the Federal Tax Code. You can call that wasted money--I call that wasted money. That is $230.4 billion that Americans spent trying to stay within the law of the current Tax Code--a quarter of a trillion dollars, not paying taxes, just paying for the ability to pay taxes. 
We must lower the excessive tax burden. It is not enough to say that taxes are excessively high and then satisfy ourselves with not reducing the burden. Shifting and simplifying the load is not enough; we have to reduce it, along with simplification. We must 
end the abuses. As bad as the current code is, it is made intolerable when it is abused. 
In cases that we have heard in hearings in the Senate, we have seen the system not merely cross the line, but cross borders and time itself to become a system worthy of a totalitarian state of another time. 
When America fears its Government, as America fears the IRS, something is wrong. This is beyond unacceptable, and it has to be stopped. We must do whatever it takes to make sure that it does and that it never returns. 
To understand our duty in this, we must first look not to the Tax Code but back to America's foundations. Perhaps we in Idaho, my home State, have the advantage of doing this a little more clearly than some. Ours is a relatively new State of the Union, so perhaps we have a bit clearer view of the intention or the role that Government should take and the role that it ought to play in taxation. 
No one was ever inspired to come to America to work for someone else, and certainly not for Washington, DC. They came to work for themselves. People did not cross oceans, and later prairies, in search of a Government program. They came in search of opportunity. Today, we have a Tax Code that takes that opportunity away and makes their search endless. 
This country was not founded on a dream of paying excessive taxes. Rather, our country arose from a rebellion against paying excessive taxes. Today, we have a Government--not in London but right here in Washington, run not by a king but by ourselves--that demands from our citizens what our forefathers rejected. 
America was not founded on an ideal of relative freedom but on the principles we believe to be absolutes. Excessive taxes are wrong, and the taxes we now pay as Americans are excessive. This is absolutely wrong. It does not matter that other governments exist in other places that demand even more excessive taxes of their citizens. Our standard was never those, and it never should be. America's goal was always to lead and not to follow, and one does not lead by looking back at those who lag behind but forward to the goals that beckon us. 
There is no more basic test of Government than what it demands of its citizens. Failure to tax fairly is the worst of Government itself. Because taxpayers are honest, we must be prudent. Because taxpayers work hard, we must remind ourselves that they, not Washington, are entitled to the reward of those works. We are but stewards of their money and they trust us to use it properly. Sadly, we are abusing this trust through excessive taxes. 
In governing, we should never use the trust that our people give us against the people themselves. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to bring one other issue before the Senate today. I am talking about `National Safe Place Week.' I rise today to thank my colleagues for passing Senate Resolution 96, which designates this week, March 15 through 21, as `National Safe Place Week.' 
I am truly pleased that the Senate agrees that Project Safe Place is a valuable community resource which deserves our attention and our recognition. 
Project Safe Place is a unique union of community agencies and the private sector that promotes the well-being of our Nation's troubled youth. It is an innovative program of nonresidential community locations where youth who are at risk or in crisis situations can obtain help quickly and find shelter if necessary. 
The mission of Project Safe Place is to cultivate community involvement, to combat adolescent crime and substance addiction, and to help youth who are abused, threatened, lost or scared, or in an unsafe situation. 
Since its creation in 1983, in Louisville, KY, the scope of Project Safe Place has spread to include more than 8,000 Safe Places nationwide, and more than 27,000 young people have sought help at these locations. We all agree that our Nation's youth are our most valuable resource. In our largest cities and our smallest towns, this resource is threatened every minute of every day and every week. 
The threats are truly enormous. Every 4 minutes in this country, a youth is arrested for alcohol-related crimes. Every 7 minutes, a youth is arrested for drug-related crimes. And every 2 hours, a youth's life is snuffed out prematurely, making homicide the No. 2 killer of 10- to 14-year-olds, usually with alcohol and drug abuse as the major factor in the violent act that took the life. Nearly half of all adolescent murders and between 20 and 35 percent of adolescent suicides are directly linked to alcohol and to drug abuse. Despite all of our efforts, alcohol and drug abuse among teenagers continues to rise. 
Child abuse and neglect also threaten our children. In 1995, Child Protection Service agencies reported that more than 1 million children were abused and neglected, and in the same year almost 1,000 children were known to have died as a result of abuse or neglect. Just like drug abuse, incidents of child abuse are increasing. Between 1986 and 1993--a span of only 7 years--substantiated reports rose by 67 percent. 
Another threat to the safety of our children is the temptation to run away from these problems rather than facing them head on. Most runaway youth are not running to some thing; rather, they are running away from family problems, drug problems, or physical or sexual abuse. Unfortunately, runaways find out quickly that their solution can only bring about more problems for themselves. In order to survive on the streets, runaways typically turn to `survival sex,' theft, panhandling, or drugs--either selling them to pay for food and shelter or taking them to relieve their pain. 
All this paints a pretty dark picture for our Nation's youth. But there is hope. For many troubled teens--over 27,000 of them in fact--this Safe Place sign that you see here serves as a beacon--a beacon of hope, a beacon of opportunity, a beacon which points to the first step in a long and sometimes difficult but necessary road to salvation. 
Here is how it works. Here is what the sign means. Here is what is behind the sign. Say you are a teenager with a major problem. You see the Safe Place sign outside of your local fast-food restaurant and you decide that you need help with whatever you are facing. You walk in. It is busy. But as soon as you mention Safe Place and ask an employee for help, you are taken into the back, where there is a quiet and comfortable situation and, most important, away from any of your friends who might happen to be in the restaurant or wonder what you are doing there. 
You do not know it, but the employee you have talked to is already on the phone to the local youth shelter. The shelter calls back to tell the employee the name of the counselor who is already on his or her way, and within minutes the volunteer, who is the same gender as you, will arrive to talk with you and transport you back to a shelter if you want counseling and a safe place to stay. If you decide to go to the shelter, counselors will be there to help you resolve your problems. Also, your family will be notified 
so that they know you are all right. 
Little did you know that the first step of walking up to the counter and asking for help would open up to you all the local community service organizations that you have in your area. Little did you know that it would be that easy to gain help for yourself when you need it. 
It is almost as easy to become a Safe Place site. Now, I took that first step last year when I asked my regional office in Pocatello, ID, to consider becoming a Safe Place location. After my employees passed a background check, they attended a short training session to become familiar with the do's and the don'ts and the what if's of greeting those who might seek help. Remember, all an employee in a Safe Place location needs to do is act as the middle person between the victim and the local Safe Place office. The Safe Place volunteers and the local youth shelter take care of everything else. 
As Safe Place grows in my home State of Idaho, I will ask that all of my regional offices might join the program as well. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to do the same in their regional offices. This morning--this very day--I have delivered information about Safe Place programs to each of my colleagues' offices, and I urge you to call the national Safe Place office to find out how you can join in this program. I also urge every business owner in the Nation or anyone who might be observing C-SPAN to talk about it and to encourage business owners to get involved. This is such an effortless way to give something back to the community you live in. 
And community is what it is all about--the businesses in a community working together with Safe Place volunteers, and these private volunteers working together with community organizations and agencies. Project Safe Place brings together the best of every community into a long chain of people and resources working together to save young lives. 
This chain is growing. Since I introduced the `National Safe Place' bill itself back in June of last year, 700 sites have been added to the Safe Place family. But this is only the beginning. The goal is to have a Safe Place in every State before the end of the millennium. That is not very far away. But I know that just as America's ingenuity created these Safe Place for kids, American industry and hard work is a guarantee that every troubled teen, every runaway and every abused or neglected child will know there is a Safe Place right in their own neighborhood if they need it. 
Mr. President, I thank you. I yield back the balance of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand today to pay tribute to a man who quietly serves his community the only way he knows how--through hard work and dedication. Bud McCall, a county commissioner since 1977, is being named Citizen of the Year by the St. Maries Chamber of Commerce. 
Bud has been an active community member in St. Maries and Benewah County longer than most people can remember. Bud serves the community in many ways: as an employer, an elected official, and a community volunteer. Today he is being recognized for his voluntary efforts during the spring floods of 1996 when Bud came to the rescue of many area residents. He tirelessly worked around the clock to help protect the community from further damage from the repeated flooding. He rounded up equipment to stabilize crumbling dikes, met with emergency crews developing a crisis management strategy, and provided shelter for those who found themselves homeless. He literally donated thousands of hours of his time and equipment for the benefit of the community when the community needed him most. However, this is nothing new for Bud. He has always been there when the community needs him. 
On a more personal note, Bud is a man of few words. He is the kind of man who, when met on the street even after a long day of hard work, will always greet you with a smile. 
Bud's love for his community is shown through all he does. I am proud today to recognize him as an outstanding citizen and public servant that represents the ideals of Idaho.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand today to pay tribute to the kind of person every community wishes they had, a down-to-earth caretaker of the community with a heart of gold. Jack Buell, Chairman of the Idaho Benewah County Commissioners is being honored in his community as Citizen of the Year. Jack, like many Idahoans, lives in a resource-rich part of Idaho. He not only provides jobs for many citizens of St. Maries, but is constantly working to enrich this small town. Jack has served as a county commissioner since 1974, and has a reputation for active leadership. This year, he was named as one of the top 25 most influential citizens in the state of Idaho by a Boise newspaper. 
It is not difficult to understand why Jack is a man of influence: He's a man of his word and a problem solver. Over the past few years, he faced demanding challenges when his community was hit by devastating floods in the spring of 1996. He worked around-the-clock to minimize the destructive damage caused by the spring floods. He offered heavy equipment, employees, campers, trailers and any other resource he had that someone else could use. He paid his employees for their work and never asked the government or community to reimburse him for his employees' wages. And still Jack was deeply frustrated that he could not do more to protect people from the problems and pain they faced as they faced their losses. 
Jack has been inspiring in his work with the community schools. When the school board couldn't get a bond passed to build a new gym for the high school, Jack got to work and found local solutions to the problem. He is a man who doesn't ask what his community can do for him, but instead asks what he can do for the community. 
Jack's passion for service without recognition does not go unnoticed. I am proud to honor this man so many call friend, and recognize him for living his daily life in a way that has earned the title of citizen of the year.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I share the concern of my colleagues from New Jersey and Ohio, and all the cosponsors of this amendment. 
I am in complete agreement with the view that there should be a no tolerance policy for drinking and driving. That kind of irresponsibility is inexcusable; the senseless human tragedy it produces is unpardonable. Our laws should be severe enough to deter anyone who thinks he or she can abuse alcohol and drive without impairment. Our law enforcement officials should have the tools they need to locate and stop these accidents waiting to happen. 
My state of Idaho is one of the states that has already adopted a blood alcohol content standard of .08 percent. They believed this was a reasonable standard, based on sound data, that would help save lives. Other states have come to the same conclusion and made the same choice. 
And that brings me to my point. 
While I would support a strong resolution from this Senate denouncing drunk driving or even recommending the adoption of this particular blood alcohol content standard, I cannot endorse this amendment. The federal government should leave this decision to the states, where it constitutionally belongs in the first place. 
I am confident if the facts truly support it, this standard will be adopted voluntarily by every state. However, I am not willing to say today that this is the one and only way to solve the terrible problem of drunk driving, nor that it is the best way. We've heard a lot on this floor and from the administration about how our states are `laboratories of ideas.' Instead of burdening them with new federal mandates, we should be ensuring they have the maximum freedom and flexibility to work out effective solutions for local problems, especially problems of this magnitude. 
In short, transportation dollars that are critical to public safety should not be threatened in order to force states into compliance with the `solution of the day'--no matter how well intended. 
While I strongly agree with the goal of stopping drunk driving in America, I strongly disagree with the path this amendment would take to achieve that goal. For all of these reasons, I have no alternative but to vote against this amendment.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to commend my colleagues on adopting Senate Resolution 96, which designates March 15 through 21 of this year as `National Safe Place Week.' 
Project Safe Place is a unique union of community agencies and the private sector that promotes the well-being of our nation's youth. It is an innovative network of nonresidential community locations where youth who are at-risk or in crisis situations can obtain help quickly and find shelter if necessary. Safe Place cultivates community involvement to combat child abuse, substance addiction, and crime. 
Since its creation in 1983 in Louisville, Kentucky, the scope of Project Safe Place has spread to include more than 8,000 Safe Places nationwide, and more than 27,000 young people have sought help at these locations. We all agree that our nation's youth are our most valuable resource. Project Safe Place volunteers have been quietly tending to this resource for fifteen years, offering help to youth who are threatened or in trouble. The recognition Project Safe Place deserves is long overdue. 
Senate Resolution 96 celebrates this outstanding program and also honors the efforts of over 2,500 dedicated Safe Place volunteers, who selflessly devote time and resources to protect our nation's young people. Two of these individuals--Sandy Bowen, the National Safe Place Director, and Mickie Adler, who has spearheaded Safe Place efforts in the state of Idaho--have been instrumental in making `National Safe Place Week' a reality. 
Sandy Bowen has been involved with Project Safe Place for 13 years. When the program began to gain momentum and become a nationwide effort in 1986, Sandy stepped in as the National Director. Over the years, her hard work, dedication, and concern have helped to bring Project Safe Place out of its infancy, transforming a simple idea into a nationwide force that is now present in over 300 of our communities. 
Mickie Adler has been the driving force behind the Safe Place movement in Idaho for four years. In fact, this month marks the four-year anniversary of Safe Place in Idaho. Last year, Mickie brought three students to my Washington office to sell me on the idea of a `National Safe Place Week.' Victoria Smith, Caroline Reams, and Jessica McCaleese--all of whom are either High School or Junior High School students from Bannock County--were articulate and poised as they conveyed the idea of promoting Project Safe Place. I would like to take this opportunity to thank these fine young ladies for bringing their ideas to my attention. 
Mickie first got involved with the Safe Place movement after Jerelee Underwood, an eleven year old girl, was abducted in Southeast Idaho. She committed herself at that time to preventing future violence against Idaho's children by initiating the first Safe Place site in Idaho four years ago. Since that time, Project Safe Place in Idaho has expanded to include 250 Safe Places in Bannock County--including my regional office there--and 18 sites in the Twin Falls area. Mickie has recently been called upon to implement the program statewide, with new Safe Places to be added in Coeur d'Alene, Burley, Caldwell and Idaho Falls. I want to do my part by offering each of my Idaho offices as Safe Place sites. I encourage my colleagues to do the same nationwide. 
There are thousands of people just like Mickie and Sandy who work hard every day because they care too much to let our children endure difficult times alone and without guidance. In part, `National Safe Place Week' will serve to honor and recognize these humanitarians. 
More than that, though, `National Safe Place Week' will build community awareness, increasing not only the number of young people the program might help, but also the number of those who themselves might contribute to the effectiveness of the program. As a father, a grandfather, and a concerned citizen, I would like to personally extend a sincere and heart-felt `thank-you' to all those who make Project Safe Place such a successful program. And, to my colleagues in the Senate: Thank you for working with me on this resolution. If passage of `National Safe Place Week' helps only one more youth by keeping him or her from turning to drugs, suicide, or the streets, then I know that our time in passing Senate Resolution 96 will have been well spent.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I come to the floor of the Senate to visit with my colleagues about NATO and NATO expansion. 
Of all the responsibilities the Senate is called upon to exercise under our constitutional system, none is more momentous--and, in most cases, as irrevocable--as our advice and consent to the ratification of treaties and treaty revisions. One of the treaty questions the Senate will be facing in the near future is whether the North Atlantic Treaty--the NATO alliance--should be modified to include the former Warsaw Pact states of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Our decision on this matter will set the structure for security in Europe and the American role in it for years, perhaps decades, to come. 
I would like to commend the distinguished Chairmen of the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Relations for the thorough and thoughtful hearings they have held on this matter. However, in my discussions with a number of Senators, particularly those who, like myself, are not members of those committees, it is clear that many Senators have only begun to focus on the many interrelated issues that touch upon the matter of NATO expansion. Indeed, some of the issues--our relations with our allies, relations with the Russians, the implications for weapons proliferation, our policy toward Iraq--are shifting every day. 
For example, this week the distinguished Majority Leader spoke forcefully about his misgivings about the agreement reached between U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq. Our entire policy in the region has been put on hold. It is well known that both France, a key NATO ally, and Russia, the obvious object of NATO expansion, strongly welcome this outcome. Will Saddam Hussein live up to this agreement? Many of us consider it unlikely. Will the United States return to the military option in a few weeks or months? I don't think any of us really yet know that. How will the Iraq crisis, what ever its outcome, affect our relations with both our allies and Russia? We do not yet know the impact of the realities of these events. How will the outcome affect the larger task of stemming the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and missile technology? We do not yet know. Not knowing the answers to these questions, are we prepared to make an irreversible decision on NATO expansion? I think not--at least not yet. 
In considering the implications just of the Iraq crisis, I bring to my colleagues' attention an op-ed by Mr. Thomas L. Friedman that appeared in the New York Times on February 17, before the Annan/Hussein deal. Mr. Friedman wrote:

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in the same vein, one of our colleagues, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, made the same point on the floor February 12, and I thought it was worth noting, especially because it came, again, before the Annan-Hussein agreement: 
But in the area of Russia, for example, this administration appears to think that they can go to the [Russians] and demand that Russia follow our policies in Iraq and insist on their support on Iraq, but at the same time this administration proposes an expansion of NATO. You have to recognize, if you were a Russian leader, you would find a certain irony in a request that was coupled in that terminology. Because, of course, an expansion of NATO, especially to Poland, is an expansion that can only be viewed in Russia with some concern and possibly viewed by some as an outright threat . . . So you can understand that Russia might view a push to expand NATO at the same time as we are asking them to support us in Iraq as being inconsistent and a bit ironic. And it reflects, unfortunately, I think, this administration's failure to understand the linkage--and linkage is the right term--between working with a nation like Russia and our capacity to do things in the Middle East and moving forward with the NATO expansion at the exact same time. Yet, if you were to listen to the leadership of this administration, they will tell you that there is no relationship, they have no overlap on those two issues. Of course, that is just not true, and that is one of the main reasons we are having problems with Russia [today]. 
In case anyone in this country has missed it, the Russians have not. They understand the linkage, even if the Clinton administration does not seem to understand it. On February 24, Vladimir Lukin, Moscow's former Ambassador to the United States and now the chairman of the Duma's Committee on International Affairs, commented: 
It would be a big mistake if the United States was offended by Russian policy toward Iraq or another country . . . Russia's policy toward Iraq is not only Russia's policy--we coincide with many other countries, including U.S. allies . . . The problem is whether Russia is considered part of the Atlantic community or not. 
Now remember, I am quoting the Russian chairman of the Committee on International Affairs of the Duma. 
He says, again: 
The problem is whether Russia is considered part of the Atlantic community or not. Russia will have to decide how it is being considered--as an equal partner or as an outsider. NATO enlargement is isolating Russia. What is the choice for us? Only to be an outsider. 
He also goes on to say: 
Not a hostile outsider, but still an outsider. It is a danger. We will become stronger, and we are still a nuclear power. It is a danger to us and a danger to you-- 
Meaning the United States. 
A few years ago there was the idea of partnership, now there is a strong hesitation in the United States. 
Mr. President, that's the linkage you are missing, that's the linkage many of us are concerned about as it relates to current policy. 
The point here, as I have noted at some length, is just one ongoing aspect of this very complex issue which we have hardly begun to assess. This is just one aspect, but there are others, no less troublesome, which I will only mention briefly. 
The Baltic States: What is the nature of our commitment to admit these States? What are the ramifications? 
Our European partners: Why are we so passive to our allies' bald insistence that they intend to bear very little of the costs of expansion? As our distinguished former colleagues Howard Baker and Sam Nunn raised the matter in their recent essay in the New York Times: 
Advocates and skeptics of NATO enlargement alike agree that the transformation of Europe's security structure should be related to the transformation of the economy. As James Baker, the former Secretary of State, has testified, European Union membership `is just as important as membership in NATO for the countries involved,' and `we must make clear that NATO membership for the countries of Central Europe is not a substitute for closer economic ties to the European Union.' 
So then, why are we taking the first step in a reintegration that is not primarily a question of security--since there is no credible threat--while our European allies, who together have greater resources to help their neighbors than the United States, continue to play what can only be said to be a secondary role? 
The `New NATO': Republicans, in particular, should be very concerned about the words of President Clinton upon signing of the Founding Act in May of 1997. He says: 
We are building a new NATO. It will remain the strongest alliance in history, with smaller, more flexible forces, prepared to provide for our defense, but also trained for peacekeeping. 
As we know, peacekeeping, in some people's eyes, can be considered offensive actions. 
I go on to quote:  
It will work closely with other nations that share our hopes and values and interests through the Partnership for Peace. It will be an alliance directed no longer against a hostile bloc of nations, but instead designed to advance the security of every democracy in Europe--NATO's old members, new members and nonmembers alike. 
Mr. President, I certainly hope this doesn't mean what it sounds like it means--the end of NATO as a defensive alliance and its transformation into a regional peacekeeping organization. Will the `new NATO' exist to protect its members--or to engage in many Bosnia-like missions all over Central and Eastern Europe? 
Now let me speak briefly of costs. To say the least, there is a great deal of skepticism over the question of how much this is going to cost the American taxpayer and whether the very low estimates now being given by the administration are, in any way, credible. I note that we have not even begun to discuss how much of the costs accruing to the new allies will end up being billed to the United States. For example, in May of 1997, ABC News quoted the American Ambassador to Hungary to the effect that the American share of buying new planes for the Hungarian Force `will be perhaps 20 percent to 25 percent' of the cost of that `at most.' 
How about 30 percent or how about 40 percent? We don't know. That hasn't been negotiated. But what this administration is saying is that we will play a substantial role in the diversity of military equipment for these new partners in NATO. 
So how much is the real cost? And, again, shouldn't we know before we are asked to vote? 
In closing, Mr. President, let me emphasize that I do not believe we are yet ready in this Senate to give this matter the full debate that it deserves and that we must hear on this issue. If we had to vote on NATO expansion on the basis of the information we now have, I would vote no, and I know that there are many others in this body who would vote no. 
I look forward to a full, detailed and lengthy debate on the issue at the appropriate time. The appropriate time is when the Senate is fully knowledgeable on the issue of NATO expansion as they take up one of their most important constitutional responsibilities: the advice and consent on these critical issues. I yield the floor.

One of the measurements I always use on issues of this gravity and importance, and especially if I do not know a great deal about them, is when there are men and women on both sides of the issue whom I respect, it demands that I begin to review it in great detail. That is what I am hearing from the Senator, that when you have the likes of Howard Baker, and a former Secretary of State, and you have Sam Nunn and a good many others on the other side of the issue who are certainly knowledgeable, I think it is time for the Senate to focus and for our colleagues to begin to try to deal with this issue, and that is why I am here. I thank the Senator for his comments.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, a few weeks ago I had the privilege of being with Senator McConnell when he received a `Legislator of the Year' award from a national organization that recognized how critical his leadership on campaign finance reform is. This is an organization that has a large broad-based membership of individual God-fearing, constitutional Americans who recognized, as most of us do, that what we have here and what was debated over the last good number of days was a way of reshaping the Constitution and our basic rights as citizens in this country. You stood up and said: No, it isn't going to happen. It will not happen. We are going to agree with the courts and we are going to keep our citizens free to express, at will, their political thoughts. 
So let me thank you for the kind of leadership you brought. Clearly, while it may go unrecognized by many, this was a phenomenally significant vote for the country and for our citizens. And I thank you for that.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, there is another vote that will occur here tonight at 6 o'clock that is very important. That is a veto override. I ask my colleagues to recognize the importance of this and the 38 military construction projects that the President vetoed last fall. He is a bit embarrassed about that now. Somehow the communication between he and the Defense Department on those projects that he had already penciled off on for this year's budget but that we found and the budget process found adequate moneys for, he vetoed. 
I am one who supported the line-item veto, but I will say if it is going to be used as haphazardly as it was used in this instance, I will have to reconsider my support, as I think others do. 
Mr. President, today the Senate is considering whether to override President Clinton's veto of 38 military construction projects last fall. The President argued that these projects weren't requested, couldn't be completed in FY 98, and did not contribute to quality of life for service member. Mr. President, I strongly disagree. I offer that his reckless veto of these projects is an indication of his disregard for important defense matters and sloppy work by his staff. 
Let me begin by setting the record straight. The President claimed that the projects he vetoed were not in the future years defense plan (FYDP). Wrong, Mr. President. 33 of the 38 projects were in the FYDP. The President also contended that design work for the projects wasn't complete and couldn't be executed in the coming fiscal year. Wrong again, Mr. President. For example, the two projects vetoed for Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho are currently designed at 50 percent or more, and could be awarded this year. 
This President has consistently underfunded the military construction budget, and then had the audacity to veto projects that the Congress thoughtfully restored. This isn't frivolous, Mr. President, the total Military Construction Appropriations approved by Congress FY 98 was already $610 million below FY 97, but the President's budget was lower--because it was reckless in underfunding the military construction and quality of life projects. In July, this body approved the additional funds for military construction recommended by the Senate Armed Services Committee to help provide money for rundown bases facilities and other high priority projects submitted by the military services that were not funded in the President's budget. It think it is noteworthy that both the authorizing Committees in the House and the Senate noted the continuing low priority military facilities received, despite maintenance and modernization backlogs. 
Congress knew better than to cut defense as deeply as the President. It's pretty clear to me that this Commander-in-Chief doesn't have the regard for the men and women in uniform that they deserve. What also angers me also is that the Administration never tried to negotiate or object to any of these projects when they came before the Congress for a vote. It seem apparent that these vetoes were either afterthought or politically motivated. 
Despite my frustration by the President's action, I do want to reiterate my support for the line-item veto. However, today Congress is also exercising its right to object and vote down those vetoed items. Certainly, a vote to override the President's veto is not a vote against the line-item veto, it's a vote against arbitrary and reckless vetoes of important projects. 
One of the items vetoed is the B-1 Bomber Avionics Shop at Mountain Home Air Force Base. I can hardly think of a more worthy candidate for military construction funds. Currently, it is difficult to keep the proper environment necessary to perform required maintenance tasks on the composite wing aircraft avionics and EMC systems. In fact, sometimes the avionics projects have to be flown off base and back to finish the required work. This mission essential avionics shop not only supports the B-1 beddown, but will also restore inefficient avionics repairs for the F-15 and F-16 which are done in an aging misconfigured building. The current facility has repeated power dumps from faulty fire suppression alarm system, leading to equipment failures and costly repairs. 
The President also vetoed the F-15 Squadron Operations Facility. This project replaces a 28 year old, substandard facility that is misconfigured for flight operation and geographically separated from the flight line. The new facility will provide adequate space to plan, brief, and critique combat crews, and direct the F-15 flight operations. Administrative space is required for the commander and staff to program and conduct mission briefings and command activities and to care for, store and issue equipment. 
Mr. President, although military construction represents a small portion of the overall defense budget, it is a very important part. The quality of our facilities and installation directly strengthens or weakens the safety and readiness of our troops. It seems apparent to me than many of the vetoed items enhance quality of life of our troops and directly contribute to the mission that our service men and women are asked to perform--no one is asking for country clubs, or golf courses here. These projects are essential to national security interests and improving the readiness of our forces. Mr. President, your vetoes are simply not justified. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding to me. Let me, again, tell him how grateful I am for the work he has done on the issue of campaign finance reform and the clarity which he has brought into the debate which I think the American people now understand. 
I say that in the context now of the discussion that goes on in this Chamber, and I also look at the news of the day. The media, I think, has really attempted to work up a bit of a feeding frenzy, showing all kinds of angles as to how this issue might have divided Congress, that it has divided the members of the same party, that there is a cry of outrage across the land as people stand up ready to storm the Capitol in protest over this issue. 
But despite the media's efforts and despite their hype, the public really does not care about this issue. In the most recent Gallup poll, where people were asked about the most important problems facing the country, campaign finance reform did not appear in the top five items on the list. In fact, in all honesty, Mr. President, it did not appear at all. 
The same stands true for the latest CBS News poll and the latest Time/CNN poll, and even the latest Battleground poll by Ed Goaes and Celinda Lake, which is a bipartisan effort to balance out the issues so you cannot question that it might be distorted one way or the other. After extensive research of all of the major polling groups, the issue of campaign finance reform did not show up as a concern amongst almost every American. 
What is important to the American people are issues like crime, economic health, health care, education, Social Security and the moral decline of our country. What people really care about is whether their kid will get to school and back safely and whether the schooling they are going to get once they get there is good and of high quality. 
They care about keeping their jobs and trying to make ends meet while they watch a good portion of their hard-earned money go to Washington to support what they think is a wasteful Federal bureaucracy. 
They care about their future, whether they can save enough money to someday retire and whether they have affordable health care. What they do not care about is campaign finance reform. It isn't a real issue at all. It is an issue created here inside the beltway to try to divide and in some instances to conquer. 
Let us just suppose for a minute that people really did care about campaign finance reform, that they sat around the dinner table at night and said, `Well, dear, how was your day at the office? And, oh, by the way, shouldn't we reform campaign finance?' I doubt that that question has been asked at any dinner table in America since the last election--after hundreds of millions of dollars were spent by some interests only to generate a passing question about how the system works. 
What Americans really do need to know are the details of the campaign laws that are currently on the books. You know, once you begin to explain the laws that are out there today, their eyes glaze over and they say, `Well, isn't that enough?' And I think they need to know about some appalling campaign practices that were used by this administration in their reelection. 
Now, we had a committee spend millions of dollars here searching out these allegations. I use the word `allegations.' My guess is the only result from it was that it diverted our attention away from other scandals besetting this administration for some period of time. 
They need to know what Congress wants to do to reform campaign finance laws and to level the playing field so that neither political party has an unfair advantage over the other. They need to know what we are going to do to make all political contributions voluntary so that no person, union or nonunion worker, is forced to pony up their money for political purposes without their expressed consent or permission. 
Is it possible that today in America people are forced to contribute money that goes to political purposes they do not want? Oh, yes, Mr. President, you bet it is. And that is the issue in an amendment before us. I do not care how the other side tries to whitewash it, the bottom line is hundreds of thousands of American working men and women who are members of unions, when given the opportunity to give voluntarily, walk away from the forced contribution that goes on currently within their unions. 
Americans need to know what we are going to do to give them complete and immediate access to campaign contribution records about who gives and to whom. This prompt and full disclosure of so-called `soft money' campaign donations will make the names of the donors immediately public and allow voters to decide if the candidate is looking after their best interests. 
So I have suggested to you today what I think Americans want to know and, most importantly, what Americans do not want to know or do not care to know or sense no urgency in knowing. 
However, under the McCain-Feingold plan, there would be an across-the-board ban of soft money for any Federal election activity, Mr. President. I feel this is a grave mistake for the political process. Report it? You bet. Report it promptly? You bet. Let the American people know they have a right to know. To ban it? Well, let us talk about that for a moment. 
Let me first recognize my colleagues who have worked hard on this issue, and let me also recognize that I think they are people with a deep concern. I have great respect for them. I have respect for their tenacity and their diligence as they brought this issue to the floor. But I just flat disagree with them. And I think a good many other of my colleagues disagree with them. And I think there is a substantial basis for that disagreement. 
As for the ban on soft money, I have several major reservations on how this measure would ultimately impact the current campaign finance system, not improving it, but creating such a hardship on this country's State and local political parties that it would force them to spend more time concentrating on raising money in order to exist. 
Under the McCain-Feingold proposal, the ban on soft money, any State and local party committees would be prohibited from spending soft money for any Federal election activity. 
Right now, State and local parties receive so-called `soft money' from their national political parties. Here in Washington, both the Republican National Committee and the Democrat National Committee receive money from donors. Some of that money is then distributed to the respective political parties in counties and locales around this country. There are thousands of State, county and local party officials who receive this financial aid. 
Then, under certain conditions--and they are clear within the law--the money is used for activities such as purchasing buttons and bumper stickers and posters and yard signs on behalf of a candidate. The money is also used for voter registration activities on behalf of the party's Presidential and vice Presidential nominees. The money is also used for multiple candidate brochures and even sample ballots. 
Let us talk about election day. You go down to the local polling site. Maybe it is a school or a church or an American Legion hall. Sometimes there is a person standing out there who hands you a sample ballot listing all of the candidates running for office in your party and the other party. And it is quite obvious some people at that point are not yet informed. They tend to vote their party. This is an assistance. No 
subterfuge about it. It is very up front. It is very clear and it is what informing the public and the electorate is all about. 
But under the McCain-Feingold proposal, it would be against the law to use soft money to pay for a sample ballot with the name of any candidate who is running for Congress on the same ballot that the State and local candidates were on. 
Under McCain-Feingold, it would be against the law to use soft money to pay for buttons, posters, yard signs, and brochures that include the name or the picture of a candidate for Federal office on the same item that has the name or the picture of a State or a local candidate office on it. What you are talking about is setting up a morass of laws to be implemented and to be enforced that becomes nearly impossible to do. 
I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.

Mr. CRAIG. Under McCain-Feingold, it would be against the law to use soft money to conduct a local voter registration drive for 120 days before the election. These get-out-the-vote drives, which have proven to be effective tools for increasing all of our parties' interests and the public's interests, would simply be banned. 
Why would we want to ban all that I have mentioned? Because under these new laws in McCain-Feingold's plan State and local officials would have to use hard money instead of soft money. And already by what I have said, the public is confused. What is hard money? What is soft money? How does it get applied? We have the FEC that is out there now trying to make rulings on something that happened 3, 4, 5 years ago. What we are talking about is timely reporting, not creating greater obstacles for the process. 
Most importantly, what we are talking about, Mr. President, is free speech. It is what the majority leader has called very clearly the greatest scandal in America. Well, the greatest scandal in America is not campaign financing. The greatest scandal in America is trying to suggest that there is a scandal when it does not exist, a scandal that under anyone's measurement just does not meet the muster. 
Poll America. I have mentioned that polling. And it does not work. Back home in my State, when I suggested at town meetings that campaign finance is an issue, they scratch their heads and say, `Why?' Most importantly, today, now they are coming out and saying, `No. And, Senator Craig, let me tell you why it wouldn't work. Because I, as an individual, am a member of a small group, and I can contribute collectively and that small group's voice can become louder. And if I am able to make my voice louder, then I can affect, under the first amendment of the Constitution, my constitutional right as a free citizen of this country by the amplification of my voice, my ideas, and my issues in the election process.' 
Of course, our colleague and leader on this issue, Mitch McConnell, has made it so very clear by repeating constantly what the courts of our country have so clearly said--that the right to participate in the political process, the right to extend one's voice through contribution is the right of free speech. 
So no matter how you look at what is going on here on the floor, no matter how pleading the cries are that major reform is at hand, let me suggest a few simple rules. Abide by the laws we have--and 99 percent of those who enter the political process do--abide by those laws, and you do not walk on the Constitution and you guarantee the right of every citizen in this country, whether by individual power or by the collective power of individuals coming together, the insurance of free speech. 
Why has the Senate rejected this issue in the past? And why will they reject it Thursday when we finally vote on this once again? Because we will not trample on free speech. We recognize what Americans across the board have said to us: Provide limited instruction, which we already have in major campaign finance reform over the last several decades, and then we trust that we will be able to extend our voice in the political process, and through that our freedoms, our constitutional freedoms, will be guaranteed, and the political process will not be obstructed by the bureaucracy that is trying to be created here today by McCain-Feingold. 
Let us look at the reality of this situation. Because of these new restrictions, local party officials--say like the Republican party chairman in Custer County, ID,--will be forced to seek out hard money donations from local businesses and individuals to fund these political activities. 
In a county of a little better than 4,000 people, this party official--who is more than likely a volunteer--now has to spend more of his or her time fund-raising, not to mention the fact that those with more money stand a better chance of winning an election. 
Party affiliation will become insignificant. 
In other words, raising hard money will become a bigger concern for these State and local officials than ever before. And, whomever raises the most money can then fund more political activities. 
Mr. President, what kind of campaign finance reform is this? What are we trying to accomplish? We've just added more laws to a system that is already heavily burdened with regulations, forced thousands of State and local party officials to go out and raise money, and created more confusion for the voters. If the point of the McCain-Feingold plan is to reform the campaign finance system, the last thing you want to do is ban soft money. 
Instead, full and immediate public disclosure of campaign donations would be a much more logical approach. 
With the help of the latest technology, we could post this information on the Internet within 24-hours. Let us open the records for everyone to see. 
Anyone interested in researching the integrity of a campaign, or in finding out the identity of the donors, or in looking for signs of undue influence or corruption would only have to have access to a computer. They could track a campaign--dollar for dollar--to see first hand where the money is coming from. 
But Mr. President, what bothers me the most about the McCain-Feingold proposal is not what is in the bill, but what has been left out. 
As I said, it is--what the majority leader once called--`the great scandal in American politics * * * and the worst campaign abuse of all.' That is the forced collection and expenditure of union dues for political purposes. 
Mr. President, this is nothing short of extortion. 
Let me make myself clear, I fully support the right of unions and union workers to participate in the political process. Union workers should and must be encouraged to become involved and active in the electoral process. It is no only their right but their civic responsibility. 
Back in my home state of Idaho, I meet with union workers in union halls, on the streets, and in their homes. And I hear their complaints, their anger and their outrage over how their dues are being spent and mishandled by national union officers. 
They say to me `Senator Craig, every month I am forced to pay dues that are used for political purposes I don't agree with. But what can I do? If I speak out, they'll call me a trouble maker!' 
During the 1996 elections alone, union bosses tacked on an extra surcharge on dues to their members in order to raise $35 million to defeat Republican candidates around the country. It is likely they used much more of the worker's money than they reported, but I am sure we will never find out the truth. 
But under the Paycheck Protection Act, union workers will have new and exapanded rights and the final say on how their money is being spent. The legislation not only protects the rights of union workers, but also makes it clear that corporations adhere to the same measure. 
Unions and corporations would have to get the permission in writing from each employee prior to using any portion of dues or fees to support political activities. And, workers will have the right to revoke their authorization at any time. 
Finally, employees would be guaranteed the protection that if their money was used for purposes against their will, it would be a violation of Federal campaign law. Mr. President, this is commonsense legislation and it is the right thing to do. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kentucky for his leadership on this issue.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, all too often, we hear frightening stories about today's young people. I think it's important to remember that not all of them deserve that bad reputation. In fact, many--if not most--of our young people step up to the responsibility of caring for their communities and fellow citizens. I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about a heroic young Idahoan, John Benscheidt, who courageously saved the life of eight year-old Douglas Schedler. This remarkable youth responded to an emergency situation with the speed of a trained professional. 
John Benscheidt was the only person to witness the heavy snow pile cascade off a condominium roof at Schweitzer Mountain and quickly bury a small child standing nearby. Without hesitating, John began digging with his snow board, trying to reach little Douglas trapped under five feet of snow. John's calls for help caught the attention of others in the area, who assisted in John's efforts to save the boy. After frantic minutes of searching, the child was retrieved and taken to Bonner General Hospital, where he was treated and released without serious injuries. 
We are all grateful that John had the presence of mind to act quickly in a life-threatening situation. The inherent characteristics John demonstrated during this incident reflect a strong upbringing and profound awareness of human value. Let him serve as a reminder to all of us that we have exceptional youth in this country who contribute greatly to our communities and to our lives. It gives me great pleasure to honor such a fine young man.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for yielding but a brief moment for the Senate to recognize something that went on last night nearly halfway around the world while all of us slept. A marvelous young lady from Idaho, and a superb athlete, won the gold medal, one of our first gold medals in this Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Picabo Street, from the Sun Valley area of Idaho, who was a silver medalist in the 1994 Olympics, brought home the gold. 
I think all of us are extremely proud this morning of our country and our athletes, and this fine woman athlete, Picabo Street, who some months ago had major knee surgery, while she was at the World Cup had a major accident, but with tremendous guts and tenacity and ability she is now one of our gold medalists and we are all proud. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today we celebrate `Food Check Out Day' and commemorate the day when the average American will have earned enough income to pay for the entire year's food supply. We celebrate the bounty from America's farms and ranches and how it is shared with American consumers through affordable food prices. 
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, on average, American consumers spend only 10.9 percent of their disposable income for food. When applied to the calendar days, that means that the average American will have earned enough income to pay for his or her family's annual food supply in just 40 days. We commemorate this fact on February 9th, which is the 40th day of this year. 
Compared to other expenses facing America's families, food is a bargain. While Americans must only work until February 9th to pay for their yearly food supply, last year they had to work until May 9th just to pay for their taxes. In addition, the percentage of disposable personal income spent for food has declined over the last 25 years. In 1997, Food Check Out Day would have been on February 10. In 1970, Food Check-Out Day would have been 11 days later than it is today--February 20. 
This is made more notable by the fact that trends indicate Americans are buying more expensive convenience food items for preparation at home, as well as more food away from home. 
The Agriculture Department's latest statistic, compiled for 1996, includes food and non-alcoholic beverages consumed at home and away from home. This includes food purchases from grocery stores and other retail outlets, including food purchases with food stamps and vouchers for the Women, Infants and Children's program. The statistic also includes away-from-home meals and snacks purchased by families and individuals, as well as food furnished to employees. 
Mr. President, many states will mark today with an event to raise food donations for their local Ronald McDonald House. The Ronald McDonald House provides a `home-away-from-home' for the families of seriously ill children receiving medical treatment in their local areas. The food donated from these Food Check Out Day programs will be used to help feed visiting families staying at the House. 
The bottom line, Mr. President, is that food in America is affordable, in large part because of America's productive farmers and ranchers. Food Check-Out Day allows us to recognize their hard work, the benefits of which we all enjoy. As a fellow rancher, I personally want to salute these Americans and thank them.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, sometimes my colleague from Massachusetts and I disagree openly, sometimes loudly, on different issues, but he and I will not disagree today on the integrity or the excellence of the individual before us, David Satcher. But we will disagree. Nobody deserves a break on the truth or the facts as it relates to the performance of an individual. 
So let the Senator from Massachusetts and I agree that David Satcher is an outstanding individual of high quality. We agree. But because of differences in philosophy that sometimes produce politics we will disagree. I think my colleague from Missouri was doing that today. And so no breaks are given to anyone, nor should they be given. We are talking about building a record that is tremendously important as we reach out to decide whether this gentleman should become America's family doctor as the Surgeon General of the United States and therefore the record and the facts as they relate to this individual's performance and what he has done in the past are relevant and very important. 
There is no question that David Satcher will probably be confirmed as the Surgeon General, and as he is confirmed and as the American public gets to know him it is important that they know a little bit about his background so they can be ready and aware of what he might do along with what he will be required to do as our Surgeon General. 
I would like to talk about two areas that I think are very important to our country as a whole. As I have said, his philosophy is generally very different from my own, and that means that I will and do fundamentally disagree with the views of many of his efforts and my view, my politics, my philosophy is different from our President's. And so it is not unusual that he might nominate somebody that I would not agree with nor would I want to vote to confirm. But I also recognize the reality and the importance of our President being able to nominate those whom he feels would serve best under his Presidency based on his philosophy and his vision of how the country ought to be. 
So, while I believe the President's choice deserves some deference, I do not believe the Senate should automatically rubberstamp any decision that our President makes. This is one that he has made. It deserves reasonable debate on the floor. I believe I can offer some of that this afternoon. 
David Satcher comes to us with a background that includes service as a Federal officer. In his capacity as Director of the Centers for Disease Control, he was made aware of serious concerns that I and other Members of both the House and the Senate had talked about and had visited with him about. I was privileged to have that conversation in my office some time ago with Dr. Satcher. I was pleased that he would come, sit down and engage in a thoughtful and earnest way about something that was of concern to me and a very large constituency in this country; that I felt he and the tax dollars engaged at the National Centers for Disease Control were being misused. 
The House and the Senate had concerns about a crusade mounted by the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control about certain kinds of things, and our director, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Satcher, went in a different direction. He launched a study against private firearms ownership in this country. 
Now, you have to scratch your head a bit and say, `What? Firearms? Guns? Centers for Disease Control?' I did. I scratched my head and said, `Dr. Satcher, where are you coming from?' Well, he was quoted to say this, that his efforts and the studies he was putting forth were `to convince Americans that guns are first and foremost a public health menace' and to that end they had ignored years of study by criminologists, people much more directed in the area of guns and crime than the Centers for Disease Control. But Dr. Satcher being politically correct for his President moved on. And therefore went on to say that they had labeled violence as an `epidemic,' and concluded that gun control was the way to cure it. 
What they failed to recognize, and they should have recognized if they are good clinicians, is that the state and the condition in which the individual is raised produces a violent person, and that a violent person will reach out in his or her act of violence and use any tool available to them. But, no, because it was politically correct, they chose firearms. 
Dr. Satcher, firearms are not an epidemic in this country, they are a constitutional right and you ought to understand that. And, while you were being politically correct for this President and your philosophy, you were being unconstitutional. You were directing the energies and the taxpayers' dollars of this country against something that in my opinion was, frankly, none of your business. But you chose to move ahead, for all the reasons I think I have just stated. 
In short, the so-called research done by that agency was, in my opinion, both politically motivated and from a scientific point of view--and we have heard about his tremendous scientific credentials this afternoon--seriously flawed. Although Dr. Satcher did not personally conduct the research, he used his position to defend it. Even worse, his leadership at CDC caused it to continue even after it came under criticism. So you have to question. My job is to question. I think my argument today is legitimate. Dr. Satcher, you were acting beyond your professional credentials and, therefore, your science in my opinion was flawed. Now he wants to be America's family doctor. 
Mr. President, law abiding gun owners are not a public health menace. Violent people are, and have demonstrated by their actions that they can become a menace to people's health. It is outrageous that the head of any Federal agency would endorse using taxpayers' dollars in a political campaign against a constitutionally protected right of the taxpayer who paid for the campaign. But the gentleman this Senate is about to vote on did just that. He very openly talked to me about it in my office and I respect him for coming to visit about it. His only argument was he just thought it was important to do. 
I noted that he was very much in sync with the President, and therefore he was obviously doing the right thing politically. But I think it is time we question him on that issue. 
This is not the only area where Dr. Satcher's extreme views, I think, generate some concern. He also supports the legality of partial birth abortions. His position on this controversial procedure is at odds with what most polling data suggest today is 80 percent of the American people, and with the professional and ethical judgment of the American Medical Association. In taking this position, Dr. Satcher clearly chooses the President's political agenda over the views of his medical colleagues. So I think it is important, when there are some who get a bit exercised here that somehow we are questioning this gentleman's sincerity, or most important his professional integrity, that this man is quite often very willing to politicize beyond science something that happens to fit the agenda of the President that he serves. 
His views on this particular procedure are so far in the minority, and I think it is important that we recognize that. Many Members of Congress who advocate abortion voted in favor of banning partial birth abortion. Dr. Satcher and President Clinton say the decision to have an abortion should be between a woman, her conscience, and her doctor; and that abortion should be safe and legal. The partial-birth abortion procedure is indefensible on any of those grounds. The procedure we are talking about is one of causing and then stopping delivery of a child. I could go into the details of that. That isn't necessary to do. It has been talked about for a long time on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I think Senators, in a large majority now, fit the understanding of the American people on this issue. 
So, let me conclude by saying that my intent this afternoon is not to impugn the talent or the integrity of Dr. Satcher. It is, though, to clearly demonstrate that he is a political nominee who can operate in political ways and has chosen to do so to stay in step with the President who nominated him and to be out of step, not only with the Constitution of this country, but in many instances the vast majority of the American people. 
I am not going to attempt to predict the outcome of the vote on the floor but my guess is that when the vote settles, Dr. David Satcher will be the next Surgeon General of the United States. I and others will watch him very closely, hoping he will serve with integrity and responsibility, and that he will not choose to use his bully pulpit as a leverage against fundamental constitutional rights in our country, or what a vast majority of the American people think would be a wrong procedure, a wrong process, or an unnecessary law. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman Hatch in introducing the joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment to protect from physical desecration the flag of the United States. This is the same resolution that the House has passed, and we hope it will soon be passed by this body and sent to the American people for ratification. 
Some of my colleagues may remember the time I came to this Senate floor with memorials from forty-three state legislatures, urging Congress to take action to protect the American flag from physical desecration. Those memorials were inserted in the Congressional Record for all to read. Today that number has swelled to forty-nine states, eleven more than are needed to ratify an amendment 
Since this amendment was proposed in 1989, poll after poll has found that eighty percent of the American people consistently support a flag protection amendment. These polls have been performed in times when flag burnings have been more frequent, and times when the flag burners have been fairly quiet; yet the result is always the same--Americans want the flag protected. 
Mr. President, today, we have an opportunity to respond to the American people by passing this resolution and sending a very simple amendment to the states for ratification. This amendment authorizes Congress to prohibit physical desecration of the flag of the United States. It is a very straight-forward proposal, and the only way this goal can be accomplished, according to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Our flag, which predates our Constitution, articulates `America,' more clearly than any other symbol does. Our flag represents the tapestry of diverse people that is America--as well as the values, traditions, and aspirations that bind us together as a nation. It waves as a patriotic symbol of our values. It's amazing to see how our flag captures basic American values and inspires people to protect them. In return, the vast majority of the American people want our flag protected from acts of intentional, public desecration. 
We have many songs for our flag and have even named it Old Glory. That's because our flag holds a special place in our hearts. No other emblem of our nation has been defended as a symbol of freedom so animatedly. No other symbol has brought our country closer together, dedicated to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. No other token has drawn immigrants to our nation, with the promise of democracy. No other artifact inspires us to rise to the same level of dignity and patriotism. 
Our flag's leading troops into battle is an American tradition, inspiring both families at home and those on the front lines; it has inspired men and women to great accomplishments; it flies over our government buildings because it symbolizes our republic; it is displayed in our schools as a reminder of the importance of learning and our desire for an educated people; it is flown from the front of our homes because we are proud to be Americans and we are proud of the contributions our nation has made; it waves above our places of business as a testament to the free enterprise system; it hangs in our houses of worship as a symbol of our freedom to worship God as our conscience dictates. The flag represents the values, traditions and aspirations that bind us together as a nation. It stands above our differences and unites us in war and peace. 
The American people want an amendment to protect the flag from desecration, and they should be given the opportunity to ratify it. We, as servants of the American people, shouldn't act as stumbling blocks. Instead, we should respond by passing this resolution. If the American people don't want this amendment, they can vote to reject it. However, we should remember that already more than three million people have signed petitions asking Congress to pass a flag-protection amendment and send it to the states for ratification. This is the first step in that process. 
Flag desecration is offensive to the majority of Americans. To publicly desecrate even one flag promotes nothing worthwhile in our society, communicates no clear message, and tears at the fabric of our nation. Chief Justice William Rehnquist said, `One of the high purposes of a democratic society is to legislate against conduct that is regarded as evil and profoundly offensive to the majority of people--whether it be murder, embezzlement, pollution, or flag burning.' The U.S. flag is more than just a piece of cloth. It represents the fabric of our nation. I urge my colleagues to listen to the voice of the American people and join us in protecting our flag.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to respond to remarks made by the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, concerning the `curio or relics' U.S. origin historic firearms issue. I believe it's important for the Senate to be aware of this information in evaluating the actions taken today on the Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary appropriations bill. 
The amendment that the Senator from New Jersey refers to, which has been under consideration in both the fiscal year 1997 and fiscal year 1998 appropriations processes, is intended to correct a serious injustice in the way that our nation's firearms import laws are being administered. The amendment stops the Administration from ignoring Congress' intent that historic firearms be allowed to return to U.S. soil. Despite the fact the amendment was not added to the Commerce, Justice, and State spending bill, I am confident, based on the bipartisan support enjoyed by the amendment, that it will be passed in this Congress. A brief review of the history behind this issue is in order. In 1984, Congress first enacted a statute, 18 U.S.C. 925(e), specifically permitting the importation of military surplus curio or relic imports. At the time of enactment, however, the statute only benefited foreign collectibles, since other acts interfered with U.S. origin curio or relics from returning to the United States. 
In 1987, Congress remedied the inconsistency by enacting a provision for the importation of certain U.S. origin ammunition and curio or relic firearms and parts into the United States at 22 U.S.C. 2778(b)(1)(B). The Treasury Department issued implementation regulations after the passage of both laws. The Department of State, which in certain cases consults with the Treasury Department on firearms imports, frustrated the purpose of the 1988 law by refusing to consent to U.S. origin applications, ostensibly on the basis of foreign policy interests. The Department of State for years has frustrated the efforts of importers to bring historic curio or relic firearms into the United States. 
In addition to fully assembled U.S. origin curio and relic firearms being denied entry into the United States, curio or relic U.S. origin military surplus parts and U.S. origin military surplus ammunition applications that used to be approved by ATF directly, are now being denied. Many hobbyists and collectors are being denied access to these historic arms. Many millions of dollars in business will now be lost on rifle parts sales and rifle ammunition, severely hurting an import industry that has already been very adversely affected by President Clinton's policies. 
With regard to the criticism that has been leveled against the amendment, and these arms, several important facts are in order. First of all, this amendment was not inserted in any bill `in the dark of night', it was part of an open mark-up over a year ago in the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee in the Senate for the appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997, and this year, for fiscal year 1998, it was added on the House side in an open full committee mark-up on the Treasury, Postal Service appropriations bill. This is a well-known issue and one that has been widely publicized; in fact, Senator Lautenberg and other opponents of this provision have certainly ensured that it has been given attention. 
I realize that opponents of this amendment have been using the media to sensationalize the subject and to scare the general public into believing that there is something nefarious about these fine old arms. However, allegations concerning or implying a special crime threat that `curio or relic' M1 Garands, M-1 Carbines and M-1911A1 pistols pose to police officers or innocent civilians is simply false. Similarly, allegations that Iran will profit from the sale of these firearms is also wrong. In addition, the characterization of what the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms trace data indicates is misleading at best, as even ATF acknowledges that ATF gun trace data may not be used to make statistical assumptions about the use of firearms. 
Here are just some of the basic facts about this matter: 
First, `curio or relics' are defined as firearms which are of special interest to collectors, and are at least fifty years old, or are certified by a curator of a municipal, State or Federal museum to be curios or relics of museum interest, or have some rare, novel or bizarre characteristic because of their association with some historical figure, period or event. They are not the crime gun of choice for criminals. 
Second, corrective language is needed to enforce existing import laws and regulations that already permit the importation of U.S. origin curio or relic firearms, parts and ammunition from non-proscribed nations (the Arms Export Control Act, Section 38, 22 U.S.C. 2778 and the Gun Control Act of 1968). 
Third, the purpose of the Gun Control Act was to provide `support to Federal, State and local law enforcement officials in their fight against crime and violence,' but not to `place any undue or unnecessary Federal restrictions or burdens on law-abiding citizens with respect to the acquisition, possession, or use of firearms appropriate to the purpose of hunting, trapshooting, target shooting, personal protection, or any other lawful activity.' Additionally, the enactment of the Gun Control Act was `not intended to discourage or eliminate the private ownership or use of firearms by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes' (i.e., such as gun collecting). The Administration's actions are completely contrary to legitimate collecting and hobby pursuits. 
Fourth, these firearms and ammunition were initially supplied to friendly foreign governments by sale or gift to promote the foreign policy interests of the United States. The U.S., under the Foreign Assistance Act, can waive receipt of any proceeds derived from such a sale and request that the proceeds be set aside in a special account. In most cases, the U.S. does so for the purposes of letting the ally nation modernize its military equipment. Since the U.S. usually would have assisted such a nation anyway in some manner with the modernization of their military equipment, the allowance of keeping the sale proceeds actually represents a potential cost savings to the U.S. taxpayer. 
Fifth, rifles, which constitute the vast majority of these guns, are not the alleged crime threat that opponents of this provision would like the American people to believe. In ATF's July, 1997 report entitled `ATF, The Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, Crime Gun Trace Analysis Reports' 8 out of 10 crime guns traced within a 10 month period in 1996/97 were handguns. Out of an average of the trace data that ATF compiled from 17 major cities across the United States, from July 1, 1997 through April 30, 1997, all rifles comprised only 7.98 percent of the total firearms traced to crimes. In fact, according to ATF's latest data concerning firearms traced to a crime scene' in 1995, out of the 70,000 firearms traced to a crime scene, only .331 percent were U.S. origin firearms. In 1996, the percentage decreased: out of the 140,000 firearms traced to 
a crime scene, only .275 percent were U.S. origin firearms. In 1997, U.S. origin firearms constitute only .303 percent out of the total 200,000 firearms traced. In summary, these firearms are generally not attractive to criminals. They are expensive, heavy, cumbersome and not easily concealable. 
Sixth, Senator Lautenberg's figure of 2.5 million U.S. origin `curio or relic' firearms that would be imported is incorrect. First of all, we do not import `millions' of guns into this country on an annual basis. Currently, the rough total number of all firearms that are annually imported into this country is in the 800,000 to 900,000 range. Only a relatively modest number of U.S. origin curio or relic firearms are available for importation into the United States in commercially acceptable and safe-to-shoot condition--these will not number in the millions. 
Finally, current law--the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Arms Export Control Act, the Foreign Assistance Act and the Gun Control Act of 1968--already prohibits U.S. importers from trading with proscribed countries, such as Iran, whose foreign policy threatens world peace and the national security of the U.S. and supports acts of terrorism. The proposed appropriations language made it very clear that importation would only be permitted from non-proscribed nations.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, with the Senate's vote today on `The Adoption and Safe Families Act,' we are sending the President a landmark reform of the nation's foster care system and a bill that will make an enormous difference in the lives of many children in America. 
Every child deserves a safe, loving, permanent family. For a lot of us, it's inconceivable that this most basic need is out of reach for hundreds of thousands of children across the nation. Although we've tried to provide a safety net to protect children at risk of abuse or neglect, that safety net is failing all too many children. The problem does not lie with the vast majority of foster parents, relatives and caseworkers who work valiantly to provide the care needed by these children. Rather, the problem is the system itself, and incentives built into it. On one end, it's allowing children to slip back into abusive homes; on the other end, it's trapping them in what was supposed to be `temporary' foster care, instead of moving them into permanent homes. 
The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 will bring more children home--to safe, permanent homes--and it will bring them home faster. It will change the culture of foster care with a number of fundamental reforms: 
Currently, to obtain federal funds, states are required to use `reasonable efforts' to keep families together. While that sounds like a goal we all can support, this requirement has resulted in states using extraordinary efforts to keep children in what may actually be abusive or unsafe situations. Tragically, it's the children who ultimately pay for mistakes when this happens--sometimes with their very lives. 
Our bill will change this. It requires that the child's health and safety must be the paramount concerns in any decisions made by the state on behalf of that child. While the reforms in the bill respect the rights of others--such as birth parents, relatives, foster families and adoptive parents--it makes clear that the focus must always be on the child's health and safety. 
In addition to this general rule, the bill provides that the `reasonable efforts' requirement does not apply where there are aggravated circumstances such as abandonment, torture, chronic abuse or sexual abuse. This is not a comprehensive list; we've tried to make clear that states have the power to suspend the requirement for other aggravated circumstances that jeopardize the health and safety of the child. 
Mr. President, these critical reforms will help save the lives of children. That's probably the most important goal of the Adoption and Safe Families Act. But it's not the only goal; other reforms in the bill are aimed at encouraging adoption and helping to move children through the foster care system and into permanent, loving homes. 
For instance, for the first time, steps will have to be taken to free a child for adoption or other permanent placement once the child has been in foster care for fifteen months or more. In cases of severe abuse, when `reasonable efforts' are not appropriate, this bill establishes a new expedited process, requiring a permanency planning hearing to be held within 30 days. For the first time, states will be required to use `reasonable efforts' to place a child for adoption, if returning the child to the family is not an option. For the first time, those efforts must be documented. 
We were particularly concerned about helping make adoption more likely for foster children with `special needs.' These are children who, by definition, are hard to place, perhaps because they require special medical help or mental health services, or the like. This bill requires health insurance coverage for children with special needs, which will make it more possible for families of all incomes to give these children a home. 
This bill also provides states with financial rewards based on their success in increasing adoptions. An even higher reward is provided for increasing the adoptions of special needs children. The bill authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to provide technical assistance to states and localities to promote adoption of foster children. We've also highlighted adoption promotion and support as services funded by the Family Preservation Program, which we have reauthorized for three years and renamed the `Promoting Adoptive, Safe and Stable Families' program. 
We also attempted to address what many in the field have told us is a major hindrance to adoption: geographic barriers. It's my understanding that states are working independently to resolve this problem. Our bill gives them an additional push toward resolution, by providing that states risk losing their federal payments if they deny or delay the placement of a child when an approved family is available outside their jurisdiction. We've also required a study and report to Congress on interjurisdictional adoption issues, so that we can take additional actions in the future in this area, if necessary. 
This bill makes a number of system reforms aimed both at helping to advance our goals and providing a foundation for additional reforms in the future. 
For instance, we're requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with state and local officials, child advocates and others in developing performance measures and publishing a report evaluating the effectiveness of our child welfare programs. This bill also requires HHS to develop and recommend to Congress a system for basing federal assistance payments on performance. It allows child welfare agencies to use the Federal Parent Locator Service to assist in locating absent parents. It allows agencies to use concurrent planning--that is, providing services to reunite or preserve the family while simultaneously recruiting adoptive parents, so that if the family cannot be preserved or reunited, the child will not have to wait such a long time before moving into a permanent home. 
Before concluding, let me acknowledge the hard work of a number of members in both the House and the Senate, without which we wouldn't have a bill today. Although we may have started with fundamentally different views as to how best to change the system, we were united--and driven to resolve our differences--by the strong belief that reform is urgently needed now. I am pleased to have had a part in the bipartisan Senate coalition that worked and re-worked this legislation: Senator DeWine, Senator Chafee, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Moynihan, Senator Jeffords, Senator Coats, Senator Bond, Senator Levin, Senator Nickles, and Senator Grassley. Special thanks must go to Chairman Roth of the Senate Finance Committee, and his staff, who helped navigate the Senate bill to the floor and through the House. The Senate coalition appreciated having excellent technical assistance from Karen Spar of the Congressional Research Service. I'd like to thank the other cosponsors of the Senate PASS Act for their support: Senator Dorgan, Senator Landrieu, Senator Johnson, Senator Kerrey and Senator Moseley-Braun. I also appreciate the efforts on the House side, led by Congressmen Camp and Kennelly, and Chairman Shaw. 
Mr. President, these reforms will save lives and help move children out of foster care, faster, and into safe, permanent, loving homes. It's the hope of all who support this legislation that President Clinton will sign it into law before the end of November--which, appropriately enough, is National Adoption Month. Let's bring these children home.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senate, by this action, has just passed a major reform in the foster care of this country, an issue that bipartisan Senators have gathered on over the last several months to resolve. Senator Roth, of the Finance Committee, in the last several weeks, working with Senator Rockefeller, Senator Chafee, myself, Senator Coats, and Senator DeWine have taken on an effort to reform foster care in this country by the proposal of this legislation that we have now gained the concurrence of the Senate on. 
It is without question, in my opinion, a landmark piece of legislation because what it does, for the first time, is use foster care the way we intended it originally to be used. It ensures the safety for abused and neglected children. It promotes adoption. It accelerates permanent placement. It offers to children of this country in need an opportunity for a loving and permanent home. And it increases the accountability of reform. 
I am extremely pleased that at this late hour we could finally bring about a conclusion to this effort.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today there will be a period for the transaction of morning business until 1 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will consider the Labor-HHS appropriations conference report. The leader anticipates 90 minutes of debate and a rollcall vote on the adoption of the conference report. Therefore, the first vote today will occur at approximately 2:30 p.m. 
Following that vote, the Senate may be asked to consider an appropriations matter to be offered by the chairman and ranking member shortly after the vote at 2:30. Therefore, additional votes can be expected during Saturday's session of the Senate. 
Since these are hopefully the last few days of the session for the 1st session of the 105th Congress, many items are in the process of being cleared for consideration by the Senate. Some of those items include the FDA reform conference report, the adoption/foster care legislation and Executive Calendar nominations. Therefore, the cooperation of all Senators would certainly be appreciated. 
Mr. President, let me say briefly that the adoption/foster care legislation, I understand, is now nearly cleared. It is an effort that I, along with Senator Chafee and Senator Rockefeller --and a good many others--Senator Coats, Senator DeWine have worked  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ N O T I C E   Under the Rules for Publication of the Congressional Record, a final issue of the Congressional Record for the first session of the 105th Congress will be published on (the 31st day after adjournment), in order to permit Members to revise and extend their remarks.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Outfitter Policy Act of 1997. 
This legislation puts into law many of the management practices by which Federal land management agencies have successfully managed the outfitter and guide industry on national forests, national parks and other Federal lands over many decades. 
The bill recognizes that many Americans need and seek the skills and experience of commercial outfitters and guides in order to enjoy a safe and pleasant journey through wild lands and over the rivers and lakes that are the spectacular destinations for many visitors to our Federal lands. 
My bill assures the public continued opportunities for reasonable and safe access to these special areas. It assures high standards will be met for the health and welfare of visitors who chose outfitted services and quality professional services will be avaiable for their recreational and educational experiences on federal land. 
This legislation is called for because the management of outfitted and guided services by this administration has created problems that threaten to destabilize some of these typically small, independent outfitter and guide businesses. In addressing these problems, this legislation relies heavily on practices that have historically worked well for outfitters, visitors, and other user groups, as well as for Federal land managers in the field. When the bill is enacted, it will assure that these past fine levels of service are continued and enhanced. 
When I introduced similar legislation, S. 2194, at the conclusion of the 104th Congress, I did do so for the purpose of creating discussion concerning outfitter and guide operations within the context of the broader issue of concessioner reform that this Congress has been addressing for two decades. 
In the year that has followed, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has held one oversight hearing on concessions operations, but has not yet addressed the issue of concessions that specifically offer outfitting and guiding services. S. 2194 provided the intended opportunity for discussion, however. It has allowed for the examination of the historical practices that have offered consistent, reliable outfitter services to the public. This earlier version of the bill also facilitated a discussion of the need for consistency between Federal agencies in the management of outfitted services and allowed the opportunity to examine policies that have provided high quality recreation services, protection of natural resources, a fair return to the government, and reasonable economic stability that the public expects. The legislation I am now introducing is a result of those discussions. 
I look forward to a hearing on this legislation and to moving with its enactment in the coming session of the 105th Congress.   
By Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, at this moment I am filing at the desk four amendments that at the appropriate time I would make efforts to attach to S. 1269, the fast-track legislation. 
The chairman is on the floor and I would provide him with a packet of information as it relates to these amendments. None of us yet know the fate of fast track or if the House will be able to engender the necessary votes to pass this legislation. 
Clearly, I think the proper refinement of fast track broadens its ability to be passed and to become law, and it becomes very important to all of us, if that is the case, that it does. I have reservations about giving the President this authority, and yet at the same time I have not stood in the way that the process be expedited to get it to the floor for a vote. But the amendments that I am filing this afternoon that I think are important are a product of the frustrations that American producers have experienced as a result of the mid-1980's North American Canadian Free-Trade Agreement and then, of course, NAFTA, the North American Free-Trade Agreement in the early 1990's. 
One of my amendments deals with the commodity problems that we have primarily in agriculture but also in the forest products industry between Canada and the United States. The flow of commodity interest is largely one way at this moment, from Canada into the United States--live cattle impacting our markets, grain bypassing through the Canadian Grain Board, the protocol of the North American Free-Trade Agreement. We have just had disputes with Canada over poultry and dairy products. We now see a flood of potatoes coming out of Canada, potatoes last year that depressed the United States producer price to almost a historic low level, putting farmers in Idaho, Washington, and Maine in jeopardy. 
As a result of that, one of my amendments would establish a bilateral joint commission to identify and recommend means of resolving national regional and provincial trading or trade distortions and differences between the United States and Canada with respect to the production, processing and sales of agricultural commodities. I have explained the reason why, and if we get to the appropriate time I hope that the chairman and the full Senate would look upon that kind of amendment in favorable light. 
Another amendment that I think certainly the chairman and the Senate would look favorably on is an amendment to enforce the S. 1296 ban on extraneous provisions. This amendment would provide effective enforcement provisions already in the bill. 
As reported, S. 1269 prohibits extraneous provisions from being included in trade agreement bills considered under fast track. The bill limits fast-track trade bill provisions to those necessary or related to the implementation of a trade agreement, or not necessary to comply with the Budget Act. 
This is a major improvement, I think, over previous fast-track legislation. However, S. 1269 currently contains no effective enforcement of this provision. Let's remember the North American Free-Trade Agreement and what we fell into there. We forced small business people to have to go to computerized methods of accounting and withholding. That was a tax increase, in so many words, that was inflicted upon us in a `take it or leave it' proposition. What my amendment would do is prohibit that kind of extraneous material, or any hidden tax that might come sneaking through, if you will, in a trade agreement of the kind the President would be allowed to negotiate under fast track. 
Also, I have offered an amendment that would require domestic tax increases to be amendable, and that adds to the strength of the amendment I have just offered. 
Those are the three. The other one is a clarification of the standard for the importation of firearms. This amendment is aimed at clarifying current law and preventing the administration from continuing to abuse its trade authority to carry out a political agenda against firearms. Even for firearm imports, there needs to be a meeting of a standard and a test. We think the administration has gone well beyond that. 
That is the essence of the amendments that I have filed. Depending on how we get to the issue of fast track and what the House is able to do in the coming hours could determine our ability here in the Senate to perfect or to shape the fast-track agreement. 
With that, I will file those amendments and yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from New York, who, I think, has spoken very clearly to what happens in large part when the Congress of the United States restrains spending. While I recognize that there were certainly added revenues by a substantially large tax increase, if the Congress following that had followed the practices of past Congresss, and that is of course, a promise to reduce spending for every so many dollars of increase--and, I think I had heard that promise over my years in the House and in the Senate--I doubt that we would be experiencing the kind of economic vitality that we are currently and that the Senator spoke to. This Congress adhered to very real spending restraints, and as a result of that the markets recognized that we were not going to spend beyond our limits and, in fact, we would actually see a reduction in deficit of the kind the Senator spoke to. There is no question that with that kind of restraint here, the markets have responded and our citizens and our work force are now experiencing the kind of economic growth of which we are all extremely proud.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the nomination of Charles Rossotti to be IRS Commissioner. I don't know whether to offer this new Commissioner congratulations or condolences. He comes to the IRS at a time of great turmoil and, I must say, also at a time of great opportunity. The process of investigating and reforming the IRS has only just begun, and I commend Senator Roth and the ranking member, the Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, for holding the recent Finance Committee hearings, and especially commend the courage displayed by the witnesses at those hearings. I say `courage' because oftentimes in the past, as witnesses have come forward, they were to find themselves only later victims of a very aggressive rogue agency that would not adhere to any reasonable policy of treating the taxpayer as somebody who deserved appropriate treatment. 
I suggest that those hearings and those witnesses are merely the tip of an iceberg; there is so much more to be uncovered and to be investigated. The recent hearings were barely over when my office started hearing from basically two groups of taxpayers: those who were cynical, saying, well, now that the hearings are over, I suspect nothing more will happen and it will be business as usual. 
That was the first type. The second type were those who were relieved to discover what appeared to be a very serious Congress finally looking toward reform and an effort to prevent IRS abuse. So they were saying to me, as a Senator, that they were not alone and that they were now willing to come forward and to express to me, or to a larger body of interest, their experience with the IRS, the problems they had. 
Similarly, the IRS restructuring bill that is now moving through the other body is a start. Let me suggest, and I think the ranking member who is here on the floor, the Senator from New York, would agree it is only a start. Taxpayers deserve as much due process protection in the matter of taxes as do all other citizens dealing with our Government in all other issues. 
Blatant disregard for individual rights has all been in pursuit of one goal by the IRS, and that was, `Get the money, get the money,' and sometimes at nearly all costs to due process, and we heard some of those examples expressed by witnesses before the Finance Committee. Drug dealers, child molesters and organized crime in many instances have more legal rights than the average taxpayer whom the IRS suspects may owe a few dollars of back taxes. 
With the IRS, the taxpayer is guilty until proven innocent, and therein lies the difference, because I will tell you that a drug dealer is, by law, innocent until proven guilty, as is the child molester. But we heard very clearly from those witnesses that they were guilty until proven innocent. Unlike the FBI or the local sheriff, if the IRS thinks someone has underpaid taxes, it can seize cars, freeze bank accounts, and all under its own authority without obtaining any kind of impartial or prior approval. If the taxpayer fills out his or her return relying on tax advice from the IRS and that advice turns out to be wrong, guess who is liable. Not the IRS, that's for sure, but the taxpayer himself or herself. If the IRS wrongfully assesses back taxes or penalties, the taxpayer usually has three basically no-win choices to make: You pay up and shut up, take the case to the tax court where the judge is usually a former IRS employee and taxpayers usually lose, or pay up and then go to Federal district court and sue to get your money back. 
Remember, I say `sue to get your money back.' While the Finance Committee's investigations focused on middle- to lower middle-income individuals, I had the representative of a relatively large corporation in my State approach me and say: You know, Senator, I know we get no sympathy. We are considered big and therefore we are considered wealthy as a company. But a good number of years ago the IRS withheld an additional $8 million that they thought was theirs and we thought was ours, and we went after it, and not long ago the courts ruled it was ours. The only problem is, the $8 million plus the interest plus all other assessments was now about $24 million. 
Will they get it back? I doubt it. But it was the IRS that was wrong, and it was the large corporation that was right. Now, that large corporation could spend the money to fight the IRS and they probably could write off a lot of their expenses fighting the IRS. Could an individual, small taxpayer, do that? Absolutely not. So, even when the IRS loses, it really wins, because the IRS, with unlimited resources, has been known to appeal and appeal a weak case until the innocent taxpayer gives up or is just simply financially exhausted and goes away. That is a story that should not have to be told on the floor of the U.S. Senate, but it is in fact a story of fact that occurs many times across this country when it should not. 
I think the IRS needs to realize that the taxpayer is the boss, because in our system of Government that is exactly the way it ought to be. Taxpayers are not a suspect criminal class in our society. Yet it appears from what we have heard, in example after example, and a good many more that could be expressed, that that is oftentimes the way they are viewed by the IRS. Taxpayers should be treated with respect and dignity and should be presumed innocent until proven guilty. 
Why should this Senator have to say that on the floor, when it ought to be a matter of fact and law? Because it is not a fact today, and now we know it. There should be no quotas, pushing agents to prosecute dubious cases. Taxpayers should not be targeted on the basis of how little resistance they can offer. Can you imagine that as the policy of a Federal agency, `Let's pick on those who can offer least resistance because we will get a greater yield on the money spent,' when they could be innocent and can be at least embattled until they are willing to give up? There should be no vendettas, absolutely not, and yet there appear to have been some and probably are some. The privacy of taxpayers should be fully respected. And, yet, is it? 
Both the IRS and the Congress have been a part of the problem. I can point the finger only at the IRS, but that would be somewhat unfair. We have created one of the most complicated tax systems in the history of this country. Sometimes the problem is the IRS, who act outside the law--or certainly to the very edges of the law. I am sure most IRS employees are decent, hard-working, and conscientious people. And I know many of these employees, as do others, and they would fit that which I have just described. But the exception has become the rule, tragically enough. The tail is wagging the dog, and the IRS is now widely perceived as a rogue agency, 
marching to its own beat with Congress afraid to touch it because Congress itself, individually, could be audited. And that has happened in the past. 
So we draw back quietly, talk tough on the floors of our collective bodies, but very seldom follow through with actual and real hearings and reform that is a product of those hearings. I certainly hope that is simply now the exception, and the rule of the day, with the action that the other body is taking and the action that I hope we will take, will be comprehensive and broad-ranging reform of this agency. 
Sometimes problems happen because previous Congresses, liberal Congresses, or simply those with a ravenous appetite that the taxpayer pay the money because we need the money--whether it is balancing the budget or spending beyond the will of the citizen--the money has to be there. So we have granted IRS what I call power beyond the law, in many instances, to collect what we ask them to collect. In any case, there is never an excuse for such behavior, and this Congress is going to change things, I hope. Certainly, if it is this Senator speaking by his intent, then it is my intent, and I believe the intent of a bipartisan Congress, for major reform. And that we must get at. 
So I invite the Commissioner whose nomination will be voted on today to work with us in a constructive way to change the character, the image, the style, the culture of an agency that is now out of control. And witnesses in our country, those who make up our country, have so demonstrated. 
Real IRS reform also depends on real Tax Code reform. I will not mention the Senator, but right after we offered some reasonable tax relief this year, he said: Well, there is relief in the Code, if you can find it. So now, to the lower middle-income people for whom we champion the tax relief, we say now go hire an accountant and spend the money to get the tax relief, and probably the tax relief will at least pay for the accountant. If that is true, that is tragic. And tragically enough, that is probably true. 
Sometimes the problem is the Tax Code--too complicated even for the IRS to understand it. Listen to these figures. The IRS publishes 480 different tax forms and another 280 forms to explain the first 480. If laid end to end, the 8 billion pages of instructions sent out by the IRS every year would circle the Earth 28 times. That is why Senator Shelby and I introduced--or reintroduced--the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act, better known as the flat tax. Why? Simplification, equity, fairness, the ability with ease to fill out a form, to know you are in compliance when you do it, and to once again set in motion something that has been historically true up until about two decades ago of the taxpayer versus the Tax Code--that was an understanding in this country that laws ought to be self-enforcing and that citizens really did want to pay their taxes, their fair share of running a Government and keeping a free society and assuring that our democracy survived. 
That has not been true of the last several decades. Taxpayers today are much more often heard to be telling their tax accountant: Find out everywhere you can where I do not have to pay taxes, because the code is too complicated and the taxes are too much. Grandfathers used to pay only about 20 percent in their taxes. That meant they got to keep 80 percent. Their grandchildren in today's work force now have to pay nearly 50 percent in their taxes, keeping only half. 
And we wonder why families can't provide for themselves today, why both parents are working when one may not want to. Oftentimes it is a combination, but most often it is just simply that they have to pay so much, so much is taken from their paycheck that they cannot survive unless both are working and providing for their family. 
Underlying our commitment to making substantial tax reform a reality, I have also cosponsored leading bills to sunset the current Internal Revenue Code by the year 2001. Mr. President, this Senate, the 105th Congress, led by conservative Republicans, have a unique opportunity, working with all of our colleagues, to assure that major reform of the IRS occurs and that we lead a march toward a significant reform of the code that brings us to a simple, fairer form that then allows the responsible downsizing of the IRS. 
No people can remain free or their government effective if they do not display trust and confidence in each other. Yet, America's tax system increasingly eats like a cancer at the very bonds of support and the legitimacy of our society. 
I urge all of my colleagues and invite the new IRS Commissioner to redouble their efforts to restore fairness to the tax system and trust to the people. Reform for the Tax Code, making it simpler, fairer and, I hope, flatter, is one approach toward doing that. Reform for the tax collector, increasing IRS accountability and requiring the IRS to treat the taxpayer with dignity, respect and the due process of the law would be a legacy that I wish could be done during my tenure in the U.S. Senate and I believe that would be a legacy that a majority of the Senators would like to leave. That is our goal. That is certainly my hope. Recognizing that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CRAIG. I want to congratulate my colleagues, Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd, for balancing the competing interests that are presented by the programs of the Interior bill, all of which have very vocal constituencies. I would like to clarify that, if the Bureau of Land Management believes that the funding provided in this bill is insufficient to carry out the objectives of wild horse and burro management, procedures for reprogramming must be followed by the Agency. Is it the managers' intention that funding not be reallocated absent the involvement of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees?

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Kempthorne, for taking out this time to reference what tragically has become all too common in America today--the loss of a beautiful person and the repercussion of that loss on the family of Coleman and Jean Harris. I must tell you, I did not know Ann, but I do know Coleman and Jean, the parents of Ann. I watched as the community around where Senator Kempthorne and I live mourned the loss of this beautiful young girl and felt the tragedy of it all. 
I don't know what we do about crime in America today. The statistics this morning were, as I drove in from the Mount Vernon area to our Nation's Capital, that the number of violent crimes is down in America. That is always positive and it is always good. When Ann left home here in northern Virginia to go to Tacoma, WA, with her friends to see friends, she did not expect to be treated violently or to become involved in a violent episode, because the perpetrator of the incident that killed Ann Harris broke the law. 
So is the answer today adding more laws to the books? It really doesn't seem to be. What Coleman and Jean Harris are doing today may well be a piece of an answer that allows citizens of this country not only to express themselves, but to recognize that this is a people problem that we are dealing with today, that it is a societal problem in our country, that stacking laws upon laws that people refuse to live by, if they decide to constantly be a breaker of the law, doesn't solve the problem. 
Now, when I came to work yesterday morning, I was involved in the standard traffic gridlock that oftentimes we become involved in in this immediate metropolitan area. There were times when my temper flared and I thought, why should this happen? Yet, I calmed myself and relaxed as much as I could to cope, so that I would not misjudge or cause a bad action. Certainly that kind of reaction, or whatever may have caused a reaction that caused the death of Ann Harris, is something that I think we all need to deal with. Thank goodness, the parents of this beautiful girl have said, `We are going to do something about it. In the name of Ann Harris, Ann's Campaign, we are going to do something about it.' 
They have not approached Senator Kempthorne and me and said we want more laws. What they have said is, `We want a campaign nationwide that recognizes that if you smile more and care more and you love more and you have more understanding and you bring back to the culture of this society some of those underpinnings that kept us whole and kept a human relationship going for so long that seems to have broken down, that may have caused the death of Ann Harris, and certainly does cause deaths around the country in drive-by shootings and those kinds of things that just seem to be baseless types of crimes, that our society can, by these actions and by this action of the Harrises, become a better and a safer place to live. That is what we must all dedicate a part of our time to. 
Dirk Kempthorne and I are lawmakers, and we could probably pass another law. Certainly, in the passion and emotion of these kinds of incidents happening, all of us want to reach out and do something about it and do it quickly. Well, this Senate and this Congress, for the last decade, has passed a lot of laws that deals with violent actions of our citizens. Yet, somehow we are told by sociologists today that we must prepare ourselves for a very violent generation of juveniles. While adult crime goes down, as I referenced, juvenile crime seems to go up. I suspect that when society as a whole does what Coleman and Jean Harris are now doing on behalf of the beautiful daughter they lost, and more and more citizens speak up and become involved, and our communities and our churches and all of the institutions of our society bind together in intolerance of this kind of activity, that we will once again become a safer place to live. 
So let me thank my colleague again for this time and this recognition. We must continue to use any pulpit we can to speak out, and certainly the Harrises have. They have every reason to. I applaud them for their action and want to be a part of it where I can be as I ask other citizens to in the name of Ann and Ann's Campaign so that we can all smile a little more in a less violent society. 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today Richard Wilson, who is the Assistant Administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Air and Radiation, has announced that they have given preliminary certification to the waste isolation pilot plant in Carlsbad, NM. To Idaho and to the Nation, this is good news, because for the first time in decades we are on the threshold of beginning to move radioactive waste to a permanent repository, and the waste isolation pilot plant in Carlsbad will handle the transuranic waste, a majority of which is stored in my State of Idaho. This is consistent with an agreement that DOE struck with the State of Idaho over a year ago. EPA's action today is also consistent with a request by Congress that EPA review the facility in Carlsbad, NM, to make sure that it met the standards that we had asked for human safety, environmental protection, and of course dealing with any potential radiation. They believe it does not. Now they must go to the public process. 
We hope they will move as quickly as possible in that, because Idaho and the rest of the country deserves to know that by 1998 we will begin to see nuclear waste moving to a safe, permanent repository that this Government and this Senate has asked for well over a decade ago. 
I thank my colleague from Alabama for yielding.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, the Senator from Nebraska, this morning to speak out against the proposal that our President yesterday announced to the Nation and to the world as it relates to this country's concept of how the world ought to be when it comes to the issue of global warming. 
But first let me thank the Senator from Nebraska for the leadership role he is taking on behalf of a very large bipartisan coalition of Senators in bringing clarity to this issue and demonstrating what is a clear opposing point of view, an opposing point of view based on science, an opposing point of view based on economics and an opposing point of view based on one of the largest coalition-building efforts I have witnessed, at least in my public life, between labor and business and public officials in this country. 
The Senator spoke out very clearly this morning on the discrepancy as it relates to what our President announced yesterday compared to what the Hagel-Byrd resolution that was adopted by the Senate some months ago spoke to. That was, if we are to enter an agreement, that agreement must be, by its definition, a world agreement, that all parties involved, that is, all nations of the world, must come together in recognition of what may or may not be an environmental problem. 
I am disappointed that the President of the United States, clearly recognizing the constitutional obligation of this body, chose largely, yesterday, in his proposal, to ignore us. While he gave us lip service and while his spokespeople have given us lip service over the last several months since the almost unanimous adoption of the Hagel-Byrd resolution, I must tell you that what our President laid down for his negotiators in Bonn yesterday is not reflective of what he has been saying or what his people have been saying. 
To the parliamentarians of the world, it is important that you understand that we are not a parliament and the President is not a prime minister. He does not speak for the majority of the U.S. Congress. He speaks for himself and for what I believe to be a narrow interest of people whose agendas take them well beyond just the concept of a better environment, but to a desire to do some industrial or economic planning nationwide, if not universally, all without any reliance whatsoever on the good judgment of the American consumer and/or the free market that this country has relied on since its very beginning. 
`Serious harm,' those are important words. Those are words that the Hagel-Byrd resolution spoke to, `serious harm to the U.S. economy.' Important words, simple words, easy to understand, a relatively small measurement and threshold to be understood by anyone negotiating a treaty that, in the long term, might bind this country in an international obligation. 
We will not, nor should we, seriously harm our citizens, the economy in which they live, and the opportunities for which they strive. And yet, the President, we believe, ignored that and talked about the need for catastrophic emissions reductions by the year 2012. Mr. President, 2012. A long time off? No, not really; clearly within my lifetime, clearly within everybody's reasonable imagination, and something that if you are to accomplish a 30-percent reduction of fossil fuel emissions off from the current path, then you must start now in significant ways to change that and alter it. It is something that you do not wait until you get out to 2008 and then you say, `Oh, my goodness.' Because if we are to be responsible in relation to a negotiated treaty, a `binding' relationship by that point would draw us into a situation 
that we could not meet, or, if we chose to meet it, we would truly handicap the economy of this country. 
This Senator will not vote to make our country and its citizens second class to the rest of the world. I cannot nor will I do that nor do I believe any Senator in this body will knowingly vote in that way. Yet, the President is proposing that we allow 130 economies, 130 nations of the world, be exempt, to be able to do anything they choose while we would choose to restrict and control ourselves. 
Mr. President, we are a nation today that is proud of its environmental legacy. We have moved faster and more directly in the last two decades to improve the environment in which our citizens live than any other nation of the world, and we have paid a big price for it. But we have been willing to pay it. We have been willing to pay it and able to pay it because we are a rich nation. Rich nations move to do things to clean up their environment. Poor nations simply cannot afford to. They are too busy trying to feed themselves, clothe themselves and put shelters over the heads of their citizens. All of those items in this country are secondary considerations because we take them for granted, because we are rich, and we are rich because of a free-market system unfettered by Government rule and regulation and, in my opinion, by the silly politics that this administration perpetrates today on faulty science or certainly a lack of science or a knowledge of what all of this means. 
I have to say, in all fairness, the President gave some reasonable suggestions for conservation, and there is no question we ought to create the kind of incentives within our economy that move our citizens, and the economy that drives us, toward conservation. That is fair and that is reasonable, and we could assume a better world with all of that in mind. 
But the thing that frustrates me most is that there is emerging out of all of the current negotiations a reminder that the developing world is saying something to us that is most significant, and I am not sure that our President is listening at this moment. They are, in essence, saying, and when they laid down their position on the table in Bonn on October 22, that developing countries are demanding reductions of 35 percent below 1990 levels of emissions and that fines be assessed against the United States and the other developed nations if those targets are missed. They want global warming gas reductions, but guess who is supposed to pay for it? Not the consumers of the developing world, but us rich Americans. Rich Americans are supposed to pay for any economic inconvenience the developing world would encounter because we are foolish enough to agree to impose these kinds of reduction targets on ourselves. 
I am sorry, Mr. President, I don't buy that, the American consumer is not about to buy it, nor do I believe the U.S. Senate will. 
So in 10 to 14 years, at about the time that the baby boomers are retiring and our Social Security system is challenged, at about the time when we are once again going to have to make tough decisions in this country about our social character and the economics that drive our social well-being, the President yesterday said we are going to lay yet a bigger burden on the economy; we are going to say that you are going to have to be at a certain level of emissions reductions and, if not, we are going to take drastic measures to drive up the cost of energy, to drive down the amount of consumption, and that's what we are prepared to do based on faulty science and interesting politics. 
I suggest, Mr. President, that what you have proposed to the world and to the Nation and to this Congress is unacceptable. It certainly appears to be unacceptable at this moment to the U.S. Senate and to all who have spent any time studying the critical issue of global warming. 
While this Nation will continue to strive for a cleaner world--and it should--and a cleaner nation and will be reasonable and responsible players, we expect the rest of the world to do the 
same. But we can also understand that where a nation tries to feed itself and clothe itself and cause its citizens, by the economy in which they live, to rise to a higher standard of living, we understand that we have had that privilege and opportunity over the years and we should not restrict nor should we cause them to achieve anything less. 
Our technology can assist, and we need to be there to help. But I suggest, Mr. President, that binding obligations, no matter how far out you push them to allegedly conform with what our country believes ought to be done, simply do not work. This proposal won't work. I agree with my colleague from Nebraska, this Senate, in my opinion, will not concur in this, will not agree to the kind of treaty that our President and his associates are attempting to cause the rest of the world to agree to. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that you understand and I hope the world understands that this Senate, the Senate responsible for the ratification of these kinds of agreements, will, at this time, not ratify what you are proposing.  
Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as you know, the Labor/HHS/Education conference committee is considering funding for national education testing. I want to make it clear where I stand on this important issue and point out to my fellow conferees the task before us. 
While I support higher standards for our schools, I cannot support national testing. National testing, despite what some of its supporters might say, is the first step toward a unified national curriculum. It is my firm belief that these decisions are better left to the States and locally elected school boards. 
Some might argue that testing to a national standard would not affect curriculum. However, to do well on the tests, students will have to be taught accordingly. This was pointed out by Acting Secretary of Education Marshall Smith who said: `to do well in the national tests, curriculum and instruction would have to change.' 
Even the Washington Post agrees that the test would be `a dramatic step toward a national guideline for what students should be learning in core subjects.' 
Mr. President, the schools of Idaho are doing well, and our students continually score above the national average in core subjects, without being told what and how to teach by Washington bureaucrats. 
Supporters of the tests argue that a national standard would be acceptable because it would be based on standards developed by the Department of Education: the National Assessment of Education Progress [NAEP]. However, the NAEP framework is fundamentally flawed. These standards are so out-of-touch that no State in 50 has adopted them. Now we're being asked to force the States to teach within the NAEP framework. 
Most offensive, Mr. President, is the fact that the NAEP framework does not measure basic skills or the student's ability to perform tasks. The NAEP framework focuses on whole language and new math concepts and awards credit for more than one response, even if the response is wrong. National testing would force local school districts to adopt these flawed strategies. 
I believe that the correct course for us to take is to direct resources to the classroom instead of forcing national standards on teachers and students. Let's assist local educators and our students in rising to the existing standards--standards set and supported by local and State leaders. 
Mr. President, the Senate has voted on this matter once, when the appropriations bill was on the floor. I, along with most of our colleagues, voted for the compromise offered by Mr. Gregg. This vote has been interpreted by some, including many in the administration, as Senate support for national testing. This is not the case, and I caution anyone from reading too much into that particular vote. 
I voted for the compromise, and I do not support national testing in any form. The true message of the vote is the Senate's willingness to alter the President's proposal and its interest in the language included in the House version of the bill. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me publicly thank my colleague, Senator Ashcroft, for his leadership on this issue. I am pleased to cosponsor his measure, S. 1215, which would prohibit the Federal Government from developing these flawed national tests.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are about to vote on a cloture motion on what is, without question, a very important issue to all of us and to the country at large. In fact, it is so important that this morning the President of the United States cried out, `Save me from myself. Save me, please. I'm off to Philadelphia to raise money, and if you don't save me by passing the new law, I may do something wrong, or I'm going to have to do what I'm going to do anyway.' 
Well, Mr. President, I'm sorry, but all I ask you to do is to abide by the law that is on the books of the land today. That is what I do. That is what the Senator who just spoke does. I doubt that Senator Dorgan ever has attempted to violate 
campaign law. I know he hasn't. He is an honest man. He makes sure he doesn't because he hires an attorney and he hires an accountant and he keeps himself legal because what we live under today is a well-regulated campaign finance system. 
I am absolutely amazed that when the American family sits down at night the first topic of the dinner table is not what about that campaign finance reform they are talking about on the floor of the Senate; I suspect that family is talking about what happened to the child who was lost on the streets of America today, or that classmate of your son or daughter whom you found out got arrested for drugs, or some other issue like that. That makes a heck of a lot more sense to the average American than the phenomenal, political, and media hype that has been built over the last 3 or 4 months about campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, if I have heard it once, I have heard it 100 times, spoken from the other side of the aisle, `Oh, they all do it.' No, we don't all do it. I just came out of a campaign and I didn't violate a law nor was I accused of violating a law. I raised money legally. I'm sorry if you have to use a smoke cloud or subterfuge to argue your political point of view. It is wrong. 
Mr. President of the United States, it is wrong to say that everybody does it, because not everybody does. I am not about to save you, Mr. President, from yourself and from going to Philadelphia today to raise money. Last I checked, you touched out of here voluntarily. You left this city voluntarily. And yet that was the argument that was used by the President of the United States today. `Well, the Senate yesterday didn't pass a law so I got to go do it again.' Sorry, Mr. President, that isn't the issue here. 
The Supreme Court yesterday spoke out very, very clearly when they said you can't deny the right of a citizen to speak out, you can't deny advocacy in a free speech society. This Senate can talk all of the politics it wants. It can line up all of the 30-second sound bites it wants, but it cannot violate the Constitution nor will the Court allow us to. 
In this instance, I would love to quiet the voice of an advocate who disagreed with me, and I had many of them last year in my campaign. I had over a quarter of a million spent against me, and I will tell you, I don't think the ads were right. In fact, I think they were wrong. I think they failed to tell the truth. But in a free society, doggone it, now and then you have to withstand somebody who doesn't agree with you and you have to withstand somebody who may tell a lie about you. If you are in public life, that is a darn fact, the sureness of what will happen, and we all know that. 
What is wrong about it? Nothing is wrong about it. Oh, I could see where we should adjust some things, but I will tell you right now, if we are going to say to a certain citizen in our society, `You are going to provide money whether you want to or not, and that money is going to make it into the political system whether you want it to or not,' and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not allow that to happen, they will not allow the average citizen to have full, voluntary participation, then there will be no reform for this Senator to vote for. 
That will not happen if I have the ability of most Senators to block issues from coming to the floor. If we are going to talk about major campaign, we must talk about fairness, we must talk about equity, and we must talk about the right of the citizen in free speech and voluntarism. 
So today I stand with pride in my defense of the Constitution and the right of the citizen. I will oppose cloture on this bill, not out of an embarrassment or not out of shame, but out of pride for the system that can work when you play by the law.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the debate over campaign finance reform is what I like to call the `News of the Day'. The media has been on a feeding frenzy looking for angles to show that this issue had divided members of Congress. That it had divided the members of the same party. There there is a cry of outrage across America as people stand by ready to storm the Capitol in protest. 
But despite the massive media hype, the public really doesn't care about the campaign finance reform issue. In the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll--where people were asked about the most important problems facing the country--campaign finance reform did not even appear as one of the top 10 items on the list. In fact, it didn't appear at all. The same stands true for the latest CBS News poll, the latest CNN/Gallup Poll, and even last month's L-A Times poll. After extensive research of all the major polls, campaign finance has not showed up as a concern among American at all. 
What is important to the American people are issues like crime, the economy, health care, education, social security, and the moral decline of the country. What people really care about is whether their children will get safely back and forth from school--and whether they'll get a good education in the public schools. They care about keeping their jobs and trying to make ends meet while they watch a good portion of their hard earned money going to Washington to support a wasteful and inefficient Federal Government bureaucracy. They care about their future--whether they can save enough money to retire some day--and acquire affordable health care. These are real concerns of Americans today. 
Now let's just support for a minute that people actually did care about campaign finance reform. That they sat around the dinner table at night and said `How was your day at the office, oh, and by the way, we really need more campaign finance laws. 
What Americans really need to know are the details about the campaign finance laws that are currently on the books. And then they need to know about the appalling campaign finance practices that were part of President Clinton's reelection effort--and how the campaign finance issues is being used to divert attention away from these scandals. 
And they need to know what Congress wants to do to reform the campaign finance laws and level the paying field so neither political party has an unfair advantage over another. 
They need to know what we've going to do to make all political contributions voluntary--so that no person--union or nonunion worker--is forced to pony up their money for political purposes without their expressed permission. 
And, they need to know what we're going to do to give them complete and immediate access to campaign contribution records about who gave how much to whom. 
This prompt and full disclosure of so-called soft money campaign donations will make the name of the donors public, aid allow the voters to decide if the candidate is looking after their best interest. Under the McCain-Feingold plan, there would be an across-the-board ban on soft money for any Federal election activity. 
Let me first recognize my colleagues who have worked on this issue at great length and in good faith. I have nothing but the deepest respect for both Senators McCain and Feingold in their tenacity and diligence to bring this issue to the attention of the public. I agree with some of their points of disagree with others--and I will continue to do so during the course of this debate. 
As for the ban on soft money, I have several major reservations on how this measure would ultimately impact the current campaign finance system. 
Not improving it, but creating such a hardship on the country's State and local political parties that it would force them to concentrate on raising money in order to exist. 
Under the McCain-Feingold proposal to ban soft money, State and local party committees would be prohibited from spending soft money for any Federal election activity. 
Right now, State and local political parties receive so-called soft money from the national political parties. Here in Washington, both the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee receive money from donors. 
Some of that money is then distributed to the respective political parties in counties and localities all over the country. There are thousands of State, county, and local party offices that receive this financial aid. Then--under certain conditions--the money is used for activities such as purchasing buttons, bumper stickers, posters, and yard signs on behalf of a candidate. The money is also used for voter registration activities on behalf of the party's Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees. The money is also used for multicandidate brochures and even sample ballots. 
Let's say it's election day. You go down to your local polling site--whether it's a school, a church or the American Legion hall. Sometimes there's a person there who will hand you what's called a sample ballot--listing all the candidates running for office who are in your party. Like most voters, you are more likely to choose the candidates of your party. 
But under the McCain-Feingold proposal, it will be against the law to use soft money to pay for a sample ballot with the name of any candidate who's running for Congress on the same sample ballot with State and local candidates of the same party. 
Under McCain-Feingold, it will be against the law to use soft money to pay for buttons, posters, yard signs, or brochures that include the name or picture of a candidate for Federal office on the same item that has the name or picture of State and local candidates. 
Under McCain-Feingold, it will be against the law to use soft money to conduct a local voter registration drive 120-days before a Federal election. 
Because of these new laws in the McCain-Feingold plan, State and local party officials will have to use hard money instead of soft money for these activities. 
Let's look at the reality of this situation. Because of these new restrictions, local party officials--say like the Republican Party chairman in Caldwell, ID--will be forced to seek out hard money donations from local businesses and individuals to fund these political activities. 
In a town of just 2,000 people, this party official--who is a volunteer--now has to spend more of his or her time fundraising, not to mention the fact that those with more money stand a better chance of winning an election. Party affiliation will become insignificant. In other words, raising hard money will become a bigger concern for these State and local officials than ever before. And, whomever raises the most money can then fund more political activities. 
Mr. President, what kind of campaign finance reform is this? We have just added more laws to a system that's already heavily regulated, increased the burden on thousands of State and local party officials forcing them to go out and raise money, and created more confusion for the voters. If the point of the McCain-Feingold plan is to reform the campaign finance system, the last thing you want to do is ban soft money. 
Instead, full and immediate public disclosure of campaign donations would be a much more logical approach. With the help of the latest technology, we could post this information on the Internet within 24 hours. Let's open up the records for everyone to see. 
Anyone interested in researching the integrity of a campaign, or in finding out the identity of the donors, or in looking for signs of undue influence or corruption would only have to have access to a computer. They could track a campaign--dollar for dollar--to see first hand where the money is coming from. 
But Mr. President, what bothers me the most about the McCain-Feingold proposal is not what's in the bill, but what has been left out. it is, what the majority leader called the other day, `the great scandal in American politics * * * and worst campaign abuse of all.' That is the forced collection and expenditure of union dues for political purposes. 
Mr. President, this is nothing short of extortion. 
Let me make myself clear, I fully support the right of unions and union workers to participate in the political process. they should be encouraged to become involved and active in the electoral process. it's not only their right but their civic responsibility. 
Back in my home State of Idaho, I meet with union workers in union halls, on the streets, and in their homes. And I hear their complaints, their anger and their outrage over how their dues are being spent and mishandled by national union officers. 
They say to me `Senator Craig (Larry), every month I am forced to pay dues that are used for political purposes I don't agree with. But what can I do? If I speak out, they'll call me a troublemaker * * *' 
During the 1996 elections alone, union bosses tacked on an extra surcharge on dues to their members in order to raise $35 million to defeat Republican candidates around the country. It's likely they used much more of the worker's money than they reported, but I'm sure we'll never find out the truth. 
But under the Paycheck Protection Act, offered by Senators Lott and Nickles, union workers will have new and expanded rights and the final say on how their money is being spent. The legislation not only protects the rights of union workers, but also makes it clear that corporations adhere to the same measure. 
Unions and corporations would have to get the permission in writing from each employee prior to using any portion of dues or fees to support political activities. And, workers will have the right to revoke their authorization at any time. 
Finally, employees would be guaranteed the protection that if their money was used for purposes against their will, it would be a violation of federal campaign law. Mr. President, this is commonsense legislation and it's the right thing to do.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, 
this week marked the 21st anniversary of the congressional passage of the 1976 National Forest Management Act. It is, therefore, a particularly appropriate time to discuss revisions to modernize NFMA and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act also passed in 1976. Today, I am introducing a revised version draft of a legislative proposal I first circulated for comments and review last December. 
Actually, as I will explain shortly, I am introducing two bills today. The first bill, called the Public Lands Improvement Act of 1997, provides a series of reforms to the management programs of the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. The second bill, called the Federal Lands Management Adjustment Act of 1997, provides an opportunity for the States or other parties to seek certain management responsibilities for Federal, multiple-use lands. 
These two bills were bound together as one proposal in my December draft. But they have changed significantly as a consequence of six workshops sponsored by the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management, as well as a foot-thick pile of comments provided by individuals and groups who took the time and effort to review the December proposal, offer us their views, and suggest many helpful changes. 
The proposal that I am introducing today has been shared with the Clinton administration. We reviewed the proposal with them earlier this week. In the very near future, we will hear their formal comments on the proposal. But I think it is fair to say that, at this point, the administration still embraces the proposition that no statutory changes are needed to the confusing and conflicting mandates that govern the Forest Service and BLM. A number of serious observers and students of these two agencies--most notably the General Accounting Office in a series of research efforts conducted on behalf of myself and Senator Murkowski--disagree strongly. 
Nevertheless, the administration's present posture is to inveigh against any changes to the law. This position makes it very difficult for this bill, or any bill, to be introduced with the kind of bipartisan support that will be needed to eventually secure passage of legislation in this area. Consequently, I am introducing this bill alone, even though there are numerous Senators on our side of the aisle who would like to be cosponsors. I have asked the full committee chairman, Senator Murkowski, to join me. 
I point out this reality not to pick a fight with the administration. Rather, I want to make it clear that I am introducing it by myself--without political cover--so that a spirit of bipartisan cooperation can have a chance to grow as we move into the formal hearings process. Any significant changes in this area of law will, by both design and necessity, be the product of bipartisan collaboration between the Congress and the administration. I not only accept this--I welcome it. 
At the same time, if you look closely at the Interior and related agencies appropriations bill reported by the Senate, you will see a number of instances where Senator Gorton and I have made it clear to the administration that--absent clarifying legislative changes to confusing and expensive statutory mandates--we are not prepared to continue to spend money to no particular end. At this point, we are sending good money after bad. 
These existing statutes--NFMA and FLPMA--are 21 years old. Their implementation today conjures the image of a sullen 
21-year-old without a job, that's moved back home, is cleaning out the refrigerator and is draining cash without contributing much to the family. In my single year as a member of the Committee on Appropriations, I have seen how many exceptionally worthy efforts are denied funds. I cannot, in good conscience, condone further spending for things like the RPA Program and NFMA plan revisions. 
I hope the administration takes the message here seriously, but constructively. That is the fashion in which is being sent. And, obviously I hope that they will review the proposal that we shared with them last week, and provide us their ideas on the statutory changes that should be made. 
With that, I would like to highlight a few of the changes that we made in response to reviewers that have provided us their comments since last December. 
First and foremost, as I indicated, I am introducing two bills today. We have separated title VI of the December draft and made it a separate bill dealing with increased opportunities for the State--and now others--to take on a larger role in Federal land management. I will treat this idea separately as we move through the hearing process. I'm doing this because a number of middle-of-the-road groups and thoughtful individuals suggested that it is impossible to focus on Federal land law reform if we are simultaneously, that is, in the same piece of legislation, looking at alternatives to Federal land management. Considering alternatives to Federal management of nationally owned lands is an intellectual `bridge too far' for many. It became an impediment to their participation and, I hope, ultimately their support for Federal land management reform. 
I can accept this, even though it does suggest a certain timidity of spirit. I will note that the most timid of spirit, by far, were those interest groups, which self-identified by their rhetoric, that vigorously opposed all discussion of this concept in any form. 
At the same time, I remain convinced that we ought to be looking at alternatives to Federal land management in a thoughtful and organized way. That is why I have introduced both bills today. We may take up the bills at somewhat different times as we move forward. But we will eventually pursue them both. 
The former Chief of the Forest Service, Jack Ward Thomas, and the General Accounting Office felt that both the BLM and the Forest Service need a much clearer statement of mission. Our December draft focused largely upon improved procedures. The GAO emphasized that any attempt to change resource management procedures would not, by itself, be sufficient to cut through the morass of confusion that currently infects Federal agency management. Therefore, we have included a discrete mission statement for both the BLM and the Forest Service in the new proposal. 
Additionally, over the past 9 months we have heard a lot from locally base, consensus groups working of Federal land management problems. I have become convinced that we ought to encourage these efforts. Therefore, this bill provides greater opportunity and encouragement to local consensus groups. Also, we provide a greater opportunity for the Forest Service and BLM to seek out local advice from interested elements of the public. I am optimistic that, if we can forge consensus at the local level, many of the national land management conflicts can be diminished in their intensity. 
In response to numerous comments, we have also made some 
significant changes to part B of title I dealing with administrative appeals and judicial review of Forest Service and BLM decisions. We still codify--for the first time--an administrative appeals process for the Forest Service. The existing appeals process is without statutory basis, and could be eliminated by administrative fiat. 
We have, however, removed the provision allowing the executive agencies the opportunity to dismiss and penalize frivolous appeals. In the December draft, we tried to use existing jurisprudential standards for discouraging frivolous legal action. Many reviewers were, however, uncomfortable with the notion of providing this authority to the executive branch agencies under any standard. 
We also removed a provision in the December draft which stated that, upon injunction of a land and resource management plan, the previous plan would apply. As with frivolous actions, we will now leave to the judiciary the case-by-case determination of an appropriate course of action after the issuance of a broad-scale injunction. 
One of the more contentious issues in the December draft was whether the land managing agencies should assure their own compliance with section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Many groups were unwilling to trust the Forest Service and the BLM to do this on their own. Here, we were guided by the thoughtful comments of the Wildlife Management Institute. The Institute suggested that, with some review and certification of their program capabilities, the land managing agencies could be so trusted. Therefore, this provision has been modified to allow the land managing agencies to do their own section 7 compliance, but only after their programs have been certified by the Fish and Wildlife Service--in consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service--as competent to carry out this responsibility. 
You may recall that, in title IV of the December draft, we created some new funding streams to increase land management activities. We received a number of comments that allowing resource managers to keep these funds locally could create perverse incentives that would result in more intensive land management--whether or not such management is appropriate in individual circumstances. At the same time, we heard from GAO and others that one of the most crying needs for additional funding is monitoring of plan implementation. The GAO emphasized that this is where the Forest Service and BLM often fall short. 
In response to both sets of concerns, we are retaining these new funding streams, but channeling any additional revenues into increased monitoring activity. It is our hope that, with better monitoring, we will get more effective plan implementation, and more projects accomplished on the ground. 
During the past few months as we have worked on this proposal, we have also been captivated by a separate discussion underway between the administration and groups who wish to bid on timber sales for the purpose of preserving--rather than harvesting--the trees. To date, the administration has correctly interpreted existing law as not providing the authority to entertain such bidders. Section 14(c) of the National Forest Management Act is specific that the purpose of timber sales is to promote the orderly harvesting of the timber. 
At the same time, where the sale is for the sole purpose of disposing of a commodity, we believe that the taxpayers should be afforded the best price--whether it is being offered by someone who wants to harvest, or someone who wants to preserve the trees. Therefore, we have added a provision in title IV of the bill which provides the administration authority which it now lacks, to allow 
nonharvesting bidders to participate in the auction of commodity timber sales that have no land stewardship function associated with them. 
Now let me spend a few moments on the second bill dealing with transfer of management responsibilities for Federal lands. As I indicated, this has been split into a separate bill to accommodate those who could not consider alternatives to Federal management at the same time they were proffering their views about how to make Federal management more effective. With regard to the State transfer bill, it is in many respects similar to title VI of our December draft. We do, however, clarify that nothing in the transfer of management responsibility is designed to infringe on Indian tribal or treaty rights. 
Additionally, we have been moved by the views of a number of free market environmentalists and scholars who have argued that there should be an opportunity for nonprofit trusts to assume a larger role in Federal land management. We have added this concept to the transfer bill. 
These are a few of the changes that we made. As I indicated, the changes are numerous and substantive. My staff indicated that, at last count, we had made some 80 changes in the December draft. It's now time to review these changes, and continue a constructive discussion on how this bill can be improved further. 
In that regard, I want to thank a number of individuals and groups who have been instrumental in providing us ideas for the improvements that we have already made. First and foremost, I want to thank former Chief, Jack Ward Thomas, for his advice and participation in our workshops. I also would like to thank a group of retired Forest Service Deputy Chiefs and Regional Foresters led by George Leonard for their thoughtful and detailed comments. 
I appreciate the assistance provided by a number of professional societies and other middle-of-the-road conservation groups who assisted us by forming committees made up of their members to review the bill and offer us formal comments. These groups include, among others, the Wildlife Management Institute, the Society of American Foresters, the National Association of State Foresters, and the Association of State Land Commissioners. In each case, their participation has been instrumental in guiding us toward some of the changes I have described. 
Now I suppose the next question is: where we will head from here? We will try to convene a first hearing before we recess this session of Congress. At this hearing, I hope to hear from those groups that have taken the extra step of forming committees of their members to review the December proposal. I would like to hear from them how responsive they think we have been to their constructive suggestions. 
Then, when we reconvene next year I will hold additional hearings to receive testimony from national interest groups, as well as from the administration. I will endeavor to be as inclusive as possible in soliciting testimony from as wide a range of groups as are interested. 
I hope that, by early next year, the administration will see its way clear to sit down with us and suggest constructive changes to this proposal. I would welcome the opportunity to work with them to see if there is a list of changes that we can agree are necessary and meaningful to pursue. 
With or without the administration's cooperation, I will nevertheless endeavor to produce a third version of this bill to have ready for committee markup sometime next spring. 
I urge all groups involved in reviewing this legislation to take the time to: first, read it; second, reflect on it; third, come in and discuss it with us if they wish; and fourth, commit themselves to moving forward to work with us to develop a land management planning process that is equitable, efficient, and sensitive to environmental, economic, and fiscal concerns.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President. I send to the desk for appropriate reference a measure to expand the use and availability of the Small Reclamation Projects Act of 1956. 
The Small Reclamation Projects Act has provided important benefits throughout the Reclamation West in the 40 years since it was first established. Over the past several years there have been various discussions on ways to expand the benefits of the program. Last Congress I introduced two measures that included some of the suggestions that have been made. Neither of the measures would have affected ongoing projects. 
One of the measures, S. 1564, dealt with financing. At the present time, the Secretary is limited to grants and loans to fulfill the objectives of the act. That legislation would have expanded the authority of the Secretary to include the use of loan guarantees as a way of stretching the limited federal resources. The other measure, S. 1565, revised existing law to expand the purposes for which assistance can be received from the Federal Government. Irrigation would have remained an authorized purpose, but it would no longer be a required component. The purposes would now include the augmentation and management of local water supplies, conservation of water and energy, fish and wildlife conservation, supplemental water for existing supplies, water quality improvements, and flood control. The legislation would have limited the application of interest on any loans to those features which are currently reimbursable with interest under reclamation law. 
On September 5, 1996, I conducted a hearing on these, and several other reclamation measures, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management. Based on the comments that I received at the hearing, and subsequent conversations that I have had with individuals and groups interested in the potential of the Small Reclamation Program, I have combined the two measures and made several changes in the sustance. I am introducing the measure today and plan to request that the Subcommittee on Water and Power of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources add this measure to its scheduled hearing on October 7, 1997. 
Mr. President, I sincerely hope that once the administration has the opportunity to read this measure and reflect on our hearing last year, they will change their minds and support this legislation. Quite frankly, I do not understand the reasons for the almost knee-jerk opposition of the administration to this proposal or their persistent efforts to terminate not only the Small Reclamation Project Act, but programs such as the Rehabilitation and Betterment loan activity. An administration that trumpets its concern for the environment should understand that one of the best ways of providing additional water supplies for instream uses, as well as for additional consumptive uses, is to repair old leaky systems. It may simple be that these programs either directly or indirectly help farmers, but I would submit, Mr. President, that they also benefit the environment and the economy.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank my colleague from Indiana for yielding. 
I have been sitting here for the last 35 or 40 minutes listening to what is a truly sincere statement by the Senator from Massachusetts as it relates to the state and the condition of the D.C. school system. 
He has left up a chart that recognizes seven categories of dilapidation that have resulted in the D.C. schools not opening on time this year. If you were to look at that chart, and all of the statistics of the D.C. school system separate from the rest of the country, you would say, `My goodness, what happened? Why didn't we give them the money to fix the doors, the windows, the electrical, the plumbing, the physical structures of the school system? What happened?' 
Mr. President, they had the money. They were given the money. I do not know what happened other than to say, they blew the money, they failed. By every measurement, the D.C. public school system is at the bottom. And that is a tragedy. 
You can defend the status quo and argue you have to pour more money in. But even the Senator from Massachusetts agrees, it isn't necessarily a money issue. 
Well, then for goodness sakes, what is it? Is it a new program, a special program, a great idea, an infusion of a new concept that will turn this public school system around? 
Many examples have been cited in one school system or another across this country by the Senator from Massachusetts over the last 40 minutes; and yet he condemns a program or an idea that is embodied in this amendment. It tries to do something very important to a failed system--inject it with a competitive idea that forces a new thinking that must be allowed to happen. 
I must tell you, if the schools of Idaho had the kind of money that the schools of the District of Columbia have, because we provide--and I do not say this with any pride--nearly $2,500 less per student than the District schools get here, and if we had the measurement of the standards and the failures of this school system, the Idaho system would have been changed dramatically years ago. You have heard the comparisons I am referencing. 
Last year, 72 percent of D.C.'s eighth graders in public school scored below the basic proficiencies in math, and 29 percent failed to meet basic proficiencies in reading; and yet they got $2,500 more per student than the Idaho students, and our scores are among the top in the country. 
I do not mean to be pounding my chest about Idaho schools. I want to see our educators get more money and I want to see more money put into Idaho schools. But it is fair and it is important that we compare a failed system with a performing system and the dollars and cents involved, and to argue, as we must, that it is not a money issue. And it isn't. And we know that. 
And this voucher amendment isn't to do with money. It is to do with the ability of parents to be able to decide what is best for their children and to have the flexibility to move on that decision. 
Why has education, Mr. President, been nearly every person in this country's No. 1 choice in the public polling of our country over the last decade when asked, `What's the most important issue on your mind?' Not because it is so good--we are oftentimes reminded of quite the opposite. It is because the public school systems of our country are in trouble. Parents are concerned about the quality of education our children get, their children get and their futures. 
When you can't guarantee safety--and the District schools can't; when you can't guarantee discipline--and the District schools can't; when you can't guarantee high standards--and the 
District schools can't; you fail. If there were an opportunity for the children of the District to go somewhere else, there would be one of the greatest educational exoduses in the history of this country. That is not going to happen. 
But what this voucher amendment offers is some reasonable understanding that we ought to try to make a difference. It isn't some grand experiment, not at all. It is, without question, an idea whose time has come, an idea to inject a competitive environment into a monopolistic system that at the very best creates the lowest common denominator. That is not good enough for the young people of this District, and it is not good enough for any young person anywhere in this country. 
The good side about the District schools not opening happened in my office over the last 3 weeks. A young lady who is a junior at Eastern High School here in the District came to intern in my office, Kimberly, a delightful young lady. We learned a lot from her; and I think she learned a lot from us. 
But she did say this to me as she left to go back to school. `Senator Craig, I think I've learned more here in 3 weeks than I'll learn in a full semester in my school.' She was being kind, but the problem is, I look at the statistics of the school she attends and she's right, she's accurate. This young lady deserves every opportunity possible that the public school system should offer her and yet it does not. 
She said, `Can I come back to your office? Can I be a part of your office, because I know that I can learn a great deal? And I'll do extra time so I can do that.' And we are going to see if we can make that happen. 
School choice--that is what we are talking about today--transfers power over basic education away from the bureaucrat and to the parent. I suggest that the failures of the District system are a clear reflection of the bureaucrats having had that opportunity. 
Nobody dare defend a school system where 40 percent of ninth graders drop out or leave before graduation or where only 50 percent of education expenditures go toward instruction, compared to 62 percent nationally. 
Mr. President, we wouldn't tolerate failures such as this in my State, and we shouldn't except them in the Nation's capital. 
Allowing for school choice is a viable solution to the woes of the District's schools. This amendment is a reasonable and appropriate answer to this crisis. This measure would provide scholarships to over 2,000 public school students, the poorest of the city's poor. These scholarships could be spent to attend any private or public school in the District or the neighboring counties of Maryland and Virginia. Most importantly, scholarships would be targeted to the poorest students, those living below or near the poverty line. 
Opponents of the measure make one argument: school choice diverts money away from public schools for the benefit of a few students. However, nothing could be further from the truth. 
This measure would not cost the public school system anything--not $1 would leave the public school system. The funding is entirely new money--taken from an increase in the Federal Government's contribution to the city's debt. 
Mr. President, today the Senate is being asked to make a choice between the status quo and real reform. I thank Senator Coats, Senator Lieberman, Senator Brownback, Senator Landrieu for offering us this opportunity to debate school choice. 
This is not a partisan issue. This is all about kids and a failing system and the responsibility of this country and its policymakers to make the difference, because it is a public educational school system. We are not going to worry about the private system. It competes. It has to be good or it will not get the kids. 
But the public school system does not have to be good because the kids that cannot afford to get out of it have to go to it. We should not sit here and pound our chests and talk about all the 
good things because we need to correct the bad things. And that way a very important public education system will be better. It is good in a lot of places around the country. It is bad here in the District of Columbia, and we ought not hold anybody prisoner to that idea. 
Let's give parents and students a fighting chance--let's give them a choice and a future. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleagues in introducing PASS, the Promotion of Adoption, Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children Act. 
Foster care was never intended to be anything more than a temporary refuge for children from troubled families. Yet all too often, `temporary' becomes `permanent,' and decisions made for children in the system are driven by considerations other than the child's own well-being. Tragically, it's the children who ultimately pay for the flaws in the system--sometimes with their very lives. 
The problem does not lie with the vast majority of foster parents, relatives, and caseworkers who work valiantly to provide the care needed by these children. Rather, the problem is the system itself, and incentives built into it, that frustrate the goal of moving children to permanent, safe, loving homes. 
PASS will fundamentally shift the foster care paradigm, without destroying what is good and necessary in the system. For the first time, a child's health and safety will have to be the paramount concerns in any decisions made by the State. for the first time, efforts to find an adoptive or other permanent home will not only be required but documented and rewarded. For the first time, steps will have to be taken to free a child for adoption or other permanent placement if the child has been languishing in foster care for a year or more. 
These are only some of the many critical reforms in Pass, designed to promote adoption, ensure the safety of abused and neglected children, accelerate permanent placement, and fix flaws in the system. The package, taken as a whole, will make an enormous difference in the lives of thousands of children. 
This comprehensive bill is the product of extensive discussion and negotiation among Senators representing a veritable universe of viewpoints on adoption and foster care reform. Although we may have come to the table from different perspectives, we agreed on a fundamental principle: that reforms are needed to ensure that a child's health, safety and permanency are paramount concerns of the foster care system. In the end, on behalf of the children, we came together and resolved our differences. PASS is the result, and I commend it to all our colleagues. 
Change is needed now; every day of delay is an eternity to a child unfairly bearing the burdens of the current system. I hope every Senator will take a careful look at PASS, and work with us to achieve true reforms in this area.

Mr. CRAIG. Does the Senator know about the new science that comes out of the study of the Superfund site in Silver Valley, ID? Does he understand also that mediation on the Superfund is now tied up in the courts--conducted by the State of Idaho--that has really produced more cleanup and prevented more heavy metals from going into the water system, and the value of that? Does he also recognize that the suit filed by the Attorney General was more politics and less substance?

But the countersuit says that based on today's science, if we had known it then, which we didn't--you didn't, I didn't, and no scientist understood it--then we could have done something different. But as of now this is not an issue for mining law; this is an issue of a Superfund law that doesn't work, that promotes litigation. That is why the arguments you make are really not against mining law reform, which you and I support in some form. What you are really taking is a Superfund law that is tied up in the committees of this Senate, is nonfunctional, and produces lawsuits.

Mr. CRAIG. My guess is that the State of Idaho with some limited assistance would champion that cause. 
I have introduced legislation that would create a base of authority. We believe it would cost the Federal Government less than $100 million. The State would work with some matching moneys. They would bring in the mining companies and force them to the table to establish the liability. Guess what would happen, Senator. We would be out of the courts. Lawyers would lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. And we would be cleaning up Superfund sites that have been in litigation for a decade, by your own admission and argument.

Mr. CRAIG. If you would yield only briefly again--I do appreciate your courtesy--there is not a $1 billion price tag. That is a figment of the imagination of some of our environmental 
friends. There is no basis for that argument. There isn't a reasonable scientist who doesn't recognize that for a couple hundred million dollars of well-placed money, that problem goes away. But, as you know, when you involve the Federal Government, you multiply it by at least five. That is exactly what has gone on here. 
I will tell you that for literally tens of millions of dollars, the State of Idaho, managing a trust fund, has shut down more abandoned mines, closed off the mouths of those mines, and stopped the leaking of heavy metal waters into the Kootenay River, and into the Coeur d'Alene, and done so much more productively, and it has not cost $1 billion. Nobody in Idaho, including our State government, puts a $1 billion price tag on this. 
This is great rhetoric, but it is phony economics.

Mr. CRAIG. Then the Chairman knows that since the 1970's a deadly poison named ethylene dibromide, or EDB, has been used as a pesticide on the reservation. Over time, EDB has leached into the groundwater at unsafe levels. Currently, approximately 1,500 people, both on and off the Fort Hall Reservation, are at risk. Most of those living on the reservation are served by one of two existing drinking water systems--one operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the other by Indian Health Service.

This assessment concluded that the preferred alternative is the incorporation of the existing Indian Health Service water supply system into a new, larger drinking water system.

Mr. CRAIG. Of course such a project would be expensive.

The Indian Health Service already has identified and suggested several areas where it might be of assistance during the education, public involvement, and coordination phase. These include providing further educational assistance and public information materials, the investigation of alternative water sources, assistance in the selection and implementation of appropriate treatment technologies, the design of ground water monitoring plans and schedules, and the coordination and sharing of data and analysis.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I concur with my colleague from Arizona. Idaho has experienced similar problems with implementation of the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program in this first season of operation. 
My colleague, the gentleman from Arizona, has identified a serious problem: use of Fee Demo authority to put the government into direct competition with the private sector. It has happened in Idaho under Fee Demo this summer, and I appreciate the gentleman's effort to bring this unfortunate development in the implementation of the Fee Demo program to the attention of our colleagues in the Senate. 
It was on the Wild and Scenic section of Idaho's Snake River in Hell's Canyon that the Forest Service conducted a pilot Heritage Expedition trip in July. The Heritage Expedition element of the Fee Demo program will be conducted regionwide next year in the Pacific Northwest and in the Southwest Regions of the Forest Service, and I'm told that the concept may be adopted nationally in the very near future. 
Essentially, the new Heritage Expedition initiative puts the Forest Service into direct competition with an adventure travel industry that is already highly competitive. Dozens of these businesses compete with each other at every primary tourist destination in the country. Thousands more have invested private capital to create and sustain unique market niches on the fringes of the National Park System, or tucked away in some remote corner of the National Forest. 
At Hells Canyon, the demand for access to the river and along trails and limited camping facilities is very competitive and increasingly difficult for resource managers to resolve. Environmentalists hold strong views that the river corridor is being trampled by boaters and hikers. Boaters cling tenaciously to levels of float boat and jetboat use that have increased steadily over decades. The Forest Service has to date been entirely unable to reduce conflicts between these various users groups, let alone soften the shrill cry from those who would radically reduce use altogether. Congress has stepped in to arbitrate a portion of these issues, and the situation is now the subject of rather heated congressional hearings. 
In pricing and advertising a whitewater Heritage Expedition through Hells Canyon last July, the Forest Service executed an extraordinary piece of business. It advertised a `deluxe, fully catered' whitewater and camping trip in which the fourth night would be spent `in the luxury of' a historic lodge. The four-day trip was offered, and I understand fully booked, for the `fee' (the agency's term of choice) of $1,740. 
The Forest Service did use the services of a river outfitter in conducting this trip and spent the final night at a commercial inn. There may have been other director costs not evident from the agency's advertisment of this trip in the Internet. But, I do not believe that this is what we contemplated when we approved the Fee Demonstration. 
It's important to note that a commercial operator in Hells Canyon would not be allowed by Forest Service river managers to charge the public such an exorbitant fee, no matter what amenities were tacked onto the basic outdoor experience. 
It was advertised by the Forest Service that a portion of its fee would directly fund `preservation, protection, and future management of Hells Canyon's irreplaceable heritage resources.' When the job of analyzing this initial pilot Demo Fee program is complete, it be important to know how much agency staff time and support costs were diverted from normal responsibilities in order to plan, package, market and conduct this trip. 
Mr. President, I agree with my colleague from Arizona. Such activities as running expeditions were not what was intended when we approved the Fee Demonstration Program.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my chairman for yielding. Let me also congratulate him for the clarity with which he spoke to this issue. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition today to the amendment of the Senator from Nevada. I hope that in the course of what I have to say, Mr. President, that my opposition is clear. This comes to the issue the chairman and the Senator from Washington put so clearly. 
The Sierra Club some months ago, the Inland Empire Public Lands Council from the inner Pacific Northwest some weeks ago, and other organizations have come out with a policy for zero cut of timber on public lands. This is a national position that is well articulated by some of the more extreme environmental groups. 
I think the Senator from Washington is absolutely correct. I believe this is step 1 in a 5- or 6-year plan. This amendment cuts about one-fifth of the resource for road building. If this is accomplished, then next year they will try for a little more, and the next year even more, and the incremental game that has been played over the last several decades that has significantly changed the character of public land use is accomplished--in this instance, the elimination of timber harvest on public lands. 
The Senator from Nevada spoke of subsidies. Let me say as loudly and as clearly as I can that there are no subsidies. He is wrong. He talks about saving the taxpayers' money. He is wrong. The Price Waterhouse study that I have in my hand says so. Many others who have analyzed the program of purchaser credit also agree. The rhetoric of purchaser credits being subsidies may sound good when you suggest larger timber companies get money--taxpayer money. If this were the case, then that is subsidy, and that is wrong. It has no intent, and it doesn't improve in this instance the environment, or the ability of our forested lands to be ongoing and productive in their production of fiber for the citizens of our country. 
So let me say very clearly that Senator Bryan's amendment does not speak to subsidy because it does not exist. And it does not speak to saving money because it would not happen. 
In addition, the amendment would eliminate beyond an actual cut of 20 percent of the $47 million that is in this budget for proposed new timber roads. It would cut, of course, the purchaser credit. And that is where the argument on subsidies rests. This program was crafted by a Democrat Congress in 1964. It doesn't mean they were right. It doesn't mean they were wrong. At the time using the best analysis they could and an appropriate 
decision as it relates to how stumpage fees could best be utilized for the benefit of the taxpayer, they came up with this method. It was thoughtful legislating at that time, and I think it remains so today. It is a good policy. Let me try to explain why it is good policy and not a subsidy. Let me also explain why I challenge the Senator from Nevada on his arguments, because if I make a challenge I ought to be able to prove it. It is only fair and right that I do so. 
The purchaser road credit system has been utilized for more than 20 years. It allows purchasers to earn credits equal to the estimated cost of constructing roads specified in a timber sale contract. The purchaser can then use the credit to pay for the timber harvest. As with the regular forest road program which utilizes appropriated funds, the purchaser road credit program primarily supports the reconstruction of existing roads. The Senator from Washington has already very clearly spoken to that diagram effectively in the chart that he has before us. Of the total number of miles of timber sales roads built nationwide in fiscal 1995, about 90 percent were done with purchaser road credits. Approximately 80 percent of the purchaser road credits were used for the purpose of reconstructing. 
I thought it was important to mention this because the Senator from Nevada spoke passionately about the Tahoe Basin, an area which I am very familiar with the way it has been harvested or rather not harvested. This lack of harvest has attributed to the fuel buildup that goes on in that region, affected the wellness of the trees, and most importantly created a potential catastrophic environment that could exist in a drought situation causing massive fire. He speaks of roads, road conditions, and road maintenance. Purchaser credits have gone toward maintaining and improving, through reconstruction, more roads than hard dollars do. Every one of those roads is built to environmental standards which actually improves the environmental situation. 
In my State of Idaho last year--an exceptionally wet year--we had road blowouts; land and hillside blowouts in our national forests where man had never been. But the biggest problem occurred in areas where roads had not been reconstructed or effectively maintained. 
So, if the Senator from Nevada wants to talk about maintaining roads and improving road environments that create less sedimentation and a better water quality in Lake Tahoe, then he ought to be coming with more money. Because money does not exist in the budget, money does not exist to improve road conditions. Therefore, environmental conditions is the very thing that he is trying to eliminate. 
But back to the issue of subsidy. I brought this chart along to demonstrate the point. The point is really quite simple. If you are going to log the trees off the land, you have to get to the trees. There are Federal trees on Federal land. Who ought to build the road? The Senator and I come from large ranching States. You have cattle out in the corral in the back of the ranch, and you want to sell them to a cattle buyer. He has to get the trucks to the corral. You say, `Build the roads to the corral, cattle buyer, and you can have the cattle.' 
He will say, `OK. And I will bid you $5 less a head because I have to spend money to build the road.' 
Or, you can say, `No. I will get the road built. I will pay for the road. Therefore, bid me the market price on my cattle.' 
That is the same scenario that goes on with public timberlands because, as the Senator from Nevada said, the timber company leaves and the road is still there. Yes, it is. It is a Federal road paid for by Federal money, owned by the Forest Service, utilized by the citizens once it is used for logging. 
Here is a good example. If the market value of the timber on a timber sale is $100, and you use the purchaser credit, it costs you $40 to build the road. You have a purchaser credit of $40. So 
you bid the market price for the timber. You bid $100. The net receipts are $60 because the purchaser road credit was constructed. If you do not have purchaser road credits it is still going to cost $40 to build the road. The logging contractor bid to the Forest Service less money because he is going to sell the trees to pay for the road he will build. So the purchaser credit is zero. He bids $60. He doesn't bid $100. He bids $60, and the net receipt is $60. 
Is that a subsidy, or is that a method of building roads that in 1964 this Congress and this Senate decided was appropriate? Call it a subsidy? I don't think you can. Try it, if you might. Price Waterhouse says no. Economists say no. The reason they say no is because of this exact chart. 
The Senator from Nevada says, `Well, BLM does it differently. They just sell the timber, and the logger builds the road.' Yes. They do. Price Waterhouse would analyze that, and every economist would analyze that and say on the ONC--Oregon and California--lands in Oregon, where the BLM has the bulk of the timber from all of their landholding across the country, they do as the Senator from Nevada suggests. But the economists would say the quality of that timber value is depressed in stumpage because the logger takes the price of the road out of the sale. 
Why is that important for Idaho, then? Why am I standing here concerned? Well, the Senator knows why. The Senator knows that in current law a share of the stumpage value is returned to local counties for schools and for roads. In his State of Nevada, down on the Toiyabe, it looks like they get a few dollars. They do not get anywhere the amount of money that Idaho, Oregon, Washington, or northern California gets. Why? If you are from Nevada, you know why. It isn't a timbered State, in large part. It is a high desert State--not a lot of trees, except in very few areas; primarily in the north, where the Senator is from, and down on the tip in the south. 
The bottom line is when you bid a timber sale you and bid $60 rather than $100 because you are taking $40 out for the road. The Federal Treasury receives the same amount of money but payments to counties decrease. 
What the Senator knows is that by this action, he is dramatically cutting the money that flows to counties for schools and for road construction--their own road construction, not this road construction, not Federal road construction. Why have we payed the counties over the years? I tell you why we have done it--because my State is 63 percent federally owned, and those are landlocked communities. They have no tax base from which to fund their schools and their local roads. 
The Senator from Nevada knows from which I speak. His State is much more owned by the Federal Government than is my State. Nevada is 84 percent. 
It is interesting that the Senator from Nevada hasn't mentioned a thing about the annual net proceeds tax that his State gets from Federal mineral resources. Last year, the State of Nevada got $613 million in severance tax from Federal mineral resources. 
I say to the Senator from Nevada. Why does he work so intently to destroy the money that my schools, the schools in Montana, Washington, and Oregon get, and speaks nothing about that intent in his State, masked in the name of the environment? Let me suggest to you that it is not so masked. It is open. It is direct, and the impact would be dramatic. In many of my counties, school funding is 60 to 70 percent funded by this base, and he would take, in many instances, 25 or 30 percent of it away immediately. If the plan of national environmental radical groups, the kind that advocate zero logging on timber forested lands, had their way the remaining funds would soon be wiped out altogether. 
I guess another thing that clearly is worth discussing, and it is terribly frustrating to me, the Senator mentioned that he had letters from Secretary Glickman as it relates to the position of this administration when it comes to their support of his amendment. The Secretary before the House of Representatives said, interestingly enough, not very long ago that the elimination of purchaser road credits would hurt mostly small timber purchasers who have less access to credit. 
Now, the Senator from Nevada talked about sticking it to the big boys. I think in reverse, if he studied it with some intent, he would find that this is not quite the case. 
I have another chart here that speaks to what Secretary Glickman was talking about--purchaser credit use: `Who buys the Federal timber?' The dark blue represents small business, the red represents large business by definition. As we can see by the chart itself, in almost every instance, they are buying better than 50 to 60 percent of the timber. 
Small business timber purchasers would be adversely affected because the potential financing problem they would encounter if they had to operate by doing exactly what the Senator said, going out up front and getting the money to construct the roads before they could harvest the trees, take them to market and get their return. The alternative is the purchaser-elect program which does not protect the small business that are have the most threat. According to Price Waterhouse, a small business still has to pay cash for the full amount of the timber. This would explain why the purchaser-elect program has been rarely used by small business timber purchasers. Of course, that is what the Senator is advocating. 
Mr. President, I recently noticed that the administration is having a bit of difficulty with what they tell us here in the Congress, and that is why I wonder about the letter the Senator has that he put in the Record. I have a copy of that letter. I say that because last year I asked about potential legal and financial liabilities associated with canceled timber sale contracts. The Forest Service provided a response, and the Department rescinded that response within just a few days. Earlier this year the Department properly rejected a position for a new policy on qualifications for timber purchasers, and 2 days later the Under Secretary claimed that an unauthorized individual had used an autosigning machine and the letter should never have been sent. 
Well, it seems as if the Secretary had tried to place himself squarely on both sides of this issue. I suggest that he put greater control on his autosigning pen. Maybe we would more clearly understand what the Department of Agriculture is all about here--whiplashed by an environmental interest that does not serve this program well, does not serve the rural forested communities of our States well and, most importantly, does not address this issue in a fair and balanced way. 
During the summer of 1966, there were several incidents where impassable roads resulting from washouts and wind-thrown trees hampered firefighters' ability to respond to fire emergencies, requiring fire crews to turn around and find other access to fires. 
Why do I just instantly bring fires into this argument? Because the affected responsive maintenance of roads that is done through this program is what allows the Forest Service to manage our forests and fight fires. There are also roads that are used by off-road-vehicle people of the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Idaho. There are our hunters, our fishermen, our berry pickers, our recreationists, our tourists. Those are the roads that were initially built to harvest timber. I would suggest to the chief of the Forest Service that if he has $440 million worth of road maintenance and backlog, he is achieving most of it today through the program that the Senator from Nevada is trying to eliminate. 
So I hope that my colleagues this afternoon, recognizing the importance of this program, the way it is used effectively--it is not a subsidy. It benefits the taxpayer. It certainly benefits the small community that is the recipient of stumpage fees that fund schools and roads. It is a program well balanced and considered by the Congress over these years, and I hope they will reject the amendment of the Senator from Nevada. I do believe it is not well thought out. It certainly does not meet the arguments that he himself made as it results to the need for effective road maintenance to provide environmental quality, water quality and the kinds of things that we appreciate from our public land. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. I rise for a brief colloquy with the manager of the bill. First, I would like to commend the Senator from Washington for his hard work on title VI of this bill. Title VI, which includes the forest resources conservation and shortage relief provisions, represents a considerable amount of effort. The title is a thoughtful attempt to resolve a very complex issue in an equitable fashion. The title is necessary because of difficulties caused by the administration regulations restricting the movement of logs across different jurisdictions. However, because the provisions of the title are so complex and involve so many intensely disputed issues, I would hope we would use the next year as a time for testing the provisions in the title and securing additional comments from all interested parties. We can evaluate how successful the provisions are, and develop any necessary changes together with other interested Senators over the course of the next year. I ask my colleague from Washington whether he agrees that we should look at the following year as a test period for this measure so that we can together evaluate any needed changes.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I think it is certainly appropriate, for a few moments, to speak to the issue at hand here on the floor and my support for what the Senator from Washington has chosen to do with the two issues that he brought to the Interior appropriations bill dealing with native Americans and sovereign immunity. 
I discussed these issues with him at length and certainly with native Americans of my State--four different tribes. I have spent a good number of hours discussing this issue and how it relates to their rights and how it relates to the rights of all citizens in this country. 
I am extremely pleased also to have worked very closely with the Senator from Colorado who I respect greatly for his opinions in this area and certainly his long-term knowledge about issues of native Americans because he is so proudly one of those amongst us who can claim that title and does so proudly and represents them so well in this body. 
I am pleased that we are willing to take this back to hearings. It is an issue of immense proportion for both non-Indian citizens of our country and Indian citizens because of the nature that is evolving upon many of our reservations and the questions that are mounting outside of them as it relates to fairness and equity. 
In my State of Idaho we have at this moment some conflict that must, I think, in the end be resolved so that there is a sense of fairness for all parties involved. There is now on both sides of this issue a lack of that sense. I hope that we can resolve some of it. It is our responsibility. We are talking about Federal law and the recognition of that law and that which has built up around it now for well over a century. 
I certainly trust my colleague from Colorado to deal with it in an even-handed, straightforward way and the Senator from the State of Washington who forced this issue upon us, in the right way, to cause us to look at something that sometimes we are not willing to or we find difficult to deal with. 
Yet there are times in our country's history when it is appropriate to look at what we intended in the past and how it has revolved into the present and whether it fits today's modernness or if there are some reasonable adjustments that can be made within law that affect people in their lives. That certainly is our responsibility. 
So I thank both of my colleagues for their willingness to cooperate and work with each other and to resolve, out of what could have been substantial conflict, an approach that I think in the end meets all of our interests in a way that serves this body and native Americans in our country well along with non-Indian citizens. 
I yield back my time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to join my colleague from the State of Washington this evening in support of and as a cosponsor of his amendment to allow resources, money, tax dollars to get to the young people of this country in a way that seems so easy and so simplistic and, yet, so right, because I suspect that the Presiding Officer, myself, and everyone on this floor believes in, and we are collectively supporters of, public education. 
I happen to be a member of the Republican leadership, and I have worked hard over the last several years to make sure that education funding is one of our party's top priorities and that we, along with everyone else who serves here, are seen to be strong supporters of public education. And we do that by expanding programs where the need is, by increasing dollars, by looking at priorities. That is what we should be doing. 
As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Education and Human Services, I have worked to make sure that that kind of rhetoric gets translated into increases in Federal funding for education, and I am pleased that this year's bill--the one that we are currently debating--has such increases in it. 
In other words, what we are doing here in the Senate is something we should be doing because the American public has asked us to do it--to examine our priorities, balance the budget, and redirect our resources and, in doing so, placing education as one of those enhanced priorities. Yet, despite all of the increases in spending, I find that teachers and parents in my State and across the Nation have not yet been able to see an improvement in their schools. There is still a high level of frustration, especially at the parental level, with the quality of education that our young people get, the method by which they are educated, and the whole combination of the environment that we call our public school system. They want to know--and I want to know--where the money goes, how the money gets spent. Why do we have a lot of people at different levels of the administrative process making decisions when, in fact, we have elected officials at the local level and professional educators who should be allowed to make the largest block of those decisions? 
Now, in many instances, the Department of Education can't tell you where the money went. It doesn't get lost, it just gets administered. The fact is that between the time we appropriate it and the time a student feels the impact of it, anywhere from 15 percent up to 25 percent of the money gets lost at the Federal and State administrative levels. The Gorton amendment cuts to the chase. It basically asks us to be true to the very arguments we have placed time and again in our town meetings and in our citizen gatherings in every State, and that is, we want local control and we want the money to get to the local level. Yet, in our desire to fund public education, we are constantly working at--if I can use the word--new schemes, new processes by which the money moves through. And in the end, as I say, as much as 25 percent doesn't get there. 
As the Senator from Washington was mentioning a moment ago--and he didn't mention my name, but I was the one visiting with him the other evening in relationship to an administrator in my State. After I toured his school, he said, `You know, Larry, the Federal programs that we have just seen, some of them are very good and well meaning and are providing very valuable service to our young people, but there is a problem.' I said, `What is that problem?' He said, `Well, 60 percent of the paperwork that my school has to do . . .'--and he means all of the paperwork--`. . . is spent on approximately 10 percent of the money we get, and that 10 percent is Federal money. That is about one-and-a-half staff people in time involved in the paper shuffle to get 10 percent of the money, because the programs are there and the projects are there. So they are bound to go after them.' 
By the way, that individual is not in the classroom teaching. That individual is sitting in an office filling out forms to identify with the Federal dollar. We all support education, but how will increases in spending make a difference if the money gets lost in the process or gets diminished dramatically in the process, at a time when we are trying to balance the budget and sort out the differences in very limited resources, trying to empower our taxpayers by letting them keep more of their hard-earned money, and still wanting to spend more on education because the public believes it is necessary, and so do we? So why can't we think of a better way to do it, instead of the schemes and the systems and the bureaucracies, when we have people who are elected at the local level, charged and empowered with the responsibility of educating young people and professionally trained educators who are there to do it, and yet the Federal system and the State systems tells them how to do it, where to do it, why to do it, and when to do it. 
The Gorton amendment says in a very clear way that there is a better way. Title I has been corrected, and it is important that it be corrected. The idea of funding has been exempt. Impact aid should be exempt because that speaks to the Federal presence in a given school district, a Federal presence of employees that oftentimes don't pay tax dollars by the nature of Federal property they might be on, be it a military base or an Indian reservation. And because there is a Federal presence it is important that that money be selected. 
Senator Gorton has exempted that. But what he has said--and importantly so for the rest of it--is create an equitable formula, allow the Secretary of Education to be the administrator of that formula, and pass the Federal dollars straight through to the local school districts, and each school might choose how to spend that money just a little bit differently. But they would choose it on a priority based on what was needed in that community and in that school district instead of pursuing the paper chase because there was a Federal program. And, we can get the money, but we really do not need that particular project in this district. But it is there, and we ought to apply for it because it will help fund a piece of this teacher's salary, and we can have them educate in the standard curriculum program along with the special program. 
That is, of course, exactly what happens. And those are the dynamics involved. That is why Senator Gorton has brought to the floor what I think is a very clean and simple idea. We are all for public education. This amendment is about public education. It is for public education. It dramatically increases the ability to get the $11 billion that we spend in public education to the teacher, to the school board member, and to the administrator but, most importantly, directly to the student. 
In fact, the Senator, who is the primary sponsor of this, believes that it increases the amount that goes to the students by well over $1 billion. I suspect we are going to hear arguments tonight: Well, but, but; How about; maybe, and This program is so valuable. Of course, that is the standard argument because that is the bureaucracy that has built up over the years, and we become defensive about it, if we are a creator of it, or an administrator of it. 
But what we are saying here tonight is let us pass the money through the Department of Education directly to the schools, to the students, to the educators, and to the administrators, and save 15 percent in administrative costs at the Federal and the State level, increase the finite resource dollar spent by well over $1 billion to the student, and be proud of the fact that we are strong supporters of public education but recognizing the fact that there are the professionals at the local level who know what they are doing and we are simply empowering them with more resources to do it. 
I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Gorton education amendment. I hope my colleagues will join with us at the time of passage in voting for it.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering today an amendment I am offering with Senators Bingaman and Domenici. 
This amendment to S. 1061 would make a change to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that is narrow in scope, but is of critical importance to irrigators in Idaho and the West. 
Our amendment solves a problem with the interpretation of a provision of the FLSA. 
Currently, nonprofit organizations that deliver water for agricultural purposes--such as water districts organized by local governments, co-ops, and non-profit corporations--are exempt from the maximum-hour requirements of the FLSA. 
However, according to the Department of Labor, if even one drop of this water is used for purposes it considers `non-agricultural', then the water delivery organization loses its exemption and severe penalties can be imposed. This is true even for minimal or incidental uses, such as road watering, lawn and garden irrigation, or livestock consumption. Such uses may be closely related to, but technically not interpreted as being, `agricultural purposes'. 
Our amendment clarifies that the maximum hour exemption applies to water delivery organizations that supply 90 percent or more of their water for agricultural purposes. 
The work being done for these organizations is very seasonal. Irrigation has never been, and can not be, a 40-hour-per-week, 12-months-a-year, undertaking. During the summer, water must be managed and delivered continually. Later in the year, following the harvest, the work load is light, consisting mainly of maintenance duties. 
Our amendment is better for employers, workers, and farmers. 
If a water delivery organization is forced to pay overtime during the summer, it will have to lay off workers in the winter. Then it will hope that skilled, specialized workers, who know the equipment and the area, are available again next spring. Our amendment solves this problem, by promoting a stable work force and level costs, year-round. 
This adjustment also helps ensure year-round incomes and job security for employees. 
Our amendment restores the flexibility that traditionally existed and was always intended by Congress. It more accurately reflects the realities of agricultural water delivery. 
Representative Mike Crapo of Idaho has introduced a similar measure in the other body. It is our hope that this adjustment finally will become law this year. 
Finally, I want to acknowledge a former member of my staff, who is now an attorney in Idaho, Norm Semanko. Norm actually began work on this amendment some time back and laid the groundwork that has led up to its adoption by the Senate today. My staff still refers to this amendment as the Semanko Act. 
I understand this amendment will be accepted on both sides. I thank the managers of the bill for their support and assistance; the chairman and ranking member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, with whom we consulted; and Senator Bingaman and his staff for their strong efforts on behalf of this amendment.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand to join my colleague from Arkansas this evening in offering this second-degree amendment. I must tell you, when the Senator approached me, I was hesitant. I don't get involved in what I originally think is a private-sector relationship, a client relationship that can be none of our business here. But when the States attorneys general and the trial attorneys have come together to craft a universal or a national agreement that the Senator from Illinois approaches tonight as part of his amendment, and they approach us to make this national law, to make this the law of the land, it is now the public's business, without doubt. 
Clearly, the Senator from Arkansas has demonstrated that this evening. He has even clearly stated----

Mr. CRAIG. Touche. 
But the Senator has very clearly pointed out there could well have been side agreements made or upfront agreements that go beyond any average person's wildest imagination to the potential of tens of billions of dollars in attorney's fees. 
Here tonight the Senator from Illinois--and just a month ago this Senate agreed to tax an industry for the purpose of the health of the children of this country, a tax that in 1 year would not even demonstrate this amount of money. How can it be possible that any one profession could draw or come to draw or believe to be entitled to that amount of money? And $250 an hour is a what the Senator's amendment says is a reasonable and right fee, and even that the average working person would pale to. 
So I am extremely pleased that the Senator this evening has brought forward the amendment. It is something that this Senate will either face now or face in the future as we deal with the crafting of a universal agreement, if that becomes possible and ultimately gets to the floor of this Senate. 
I will join with the Senator however many times it takes to make sure that what he has proposed as an amendment tonight can and must become the law of the land, because in his wisdom and in the crafting of this amendment, he says that the excess dollars go where they ought to go, to children's health because all of us are extremely concerned about the rapid increase in teenage smoking in this country. That is part of what spurred this whole effort that is now nationwide as it relates to smoking and the tobacco industry. 
So I think the amendment to the pending amendment is appropriate this evening. It fits into what we are trying to do if in fact we become participants in the crafting of a global agreement as it relates to what is attempted to be resolved between the States attorneys general, the tobacco industry, and the representatives of those States attorneys general. So I join my colleague tonight. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important second-degree amendment.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to disapprove the President's line-item veto of a provision providing tax relief when an agricultural production facility is sold to a farmer cooperative--a veto that has produced a cry of outrage from Idaho's farm families. 
I am disappointed that the President vetoed this provision of the Tax Relief Act of 1997. This provision had strong bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House. This type of tax relief deserves to be debated on the merits and enacted into law. 
Because of the large number of ultimate beneficiaries involved in this kind of tax provision, it is my opinion that this item was erroneously identified as a candidate for a line-item veto. 
In Idaho, for example, in a single co-op, there are 1,130 family farm members who have been interested in this kind of tax law change for a long time. 
Changes in agricultural policy over recent years are intended to make American agriculture more market based. Prior changes in tax laws raised hurdles for agriculture at a time when world markets were becoming more competitive. Current tax law allows some advantages to corporations and other entities that are denied to farmer cooperatives. 
To allow family farmers in Idaho and across America to remain productive and effective in this changing environment, our tax laws need further revision. The provision the President vetoed would have helped, by allowing farmer cooperatives, by expanding their operations and compete more fully and fairly. 
I do not believe the President vetoed this provision without reservations. The White House has said publicly that the issue of ensuring the competitive ability of farmer cooperatives should be addressed. The administration had technical objections which, I believe, we should be able to work out. 
It is my hope, and it is fully my intention in introducing this bill today, that Members of Congress, from both sides of the aisle, and the administration can now sit down and work out the details of similar legislation and produce a win-win solution--one that helps farm families and addresses technical concerns expressed by the administration. 
I also want to address some important procedural matters. 
I am optimistic that, ultimately, legislation providing relief to farmer cooperatives and making any necessary and reasonable technical changes, will move on a track totally separate from this bill. That is my hope and intent. 
But we are constrained by procedure and timing in the introduction of this bill. Introduction of this bill, in this form, no later than today, is the only way to keep all procedural options open to the Congress. 
The Line Item Veto Act prescribes the precise form and content of this type of bill. Therefore, this bill refers to one other vetoed item besides the farmer cooperative item I have addressed. It is my understanding that persons supporting that item already are working out its consideration on a separate track. 
I hope and expect that the same will be true of the farmer cooperative item many in this body have supported. I stand ready to work with my colleagues and the administration on any reasonable, technical changes needed to enact such needed tax relief into law.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Bingaman. I am offering an amendment to S. 1061 that would make a very narrow change in the Fair Labor Standards Act. This is a small amendment, but it is critically important to irrigators in Idaho and across the West. 
My amendment would solve a problem with the interpretation of a provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act clarifying that the maximum hour exemption for agricultural employees apply to water delivery organizations that supply 90 percent or more of their water for agricultural purposes. 
My colleague, Congressman Mike Crapo, has introduced a like measure in the House. This is an issue we struggled with for some time, Mr. President. What we are simply saying is that nonprofit co-ops that deliver water are exempt. We have always done it. We have done it for other provisions under the fair labor standards. But if that irrigation ditch happens to cross a pasture and cattle drink out of it and there is some other measure or use other than irrigation that falls under fair labor standards, we are saying OK, but a narrow window. Ninety percent has to be for that purpose, the other 10 percent might accidentally be used for those purposes and might not fall under the qualifications. The intent of the amendment, I think, clarifies, and certainly irrigators across the West working with other organizations had hoped we could resolve this issue. It has been some time in the making. 
Representative Mike Crapo of Idaho and I previously have introduced a similar provision as a bill--S. 259 in the Senate and H.R. 526 in the other body. Our amendment would restore the flexibility that was always intended by Congress. 
Nonprofit organizations, such as independent water districts or nonprofit corporations, which deliver water for agricultural purposes, are exempt from the maximum-hour requirements of the FLSA. The Department of Labor has interpreted this to mean that no amount of this water, however minimal, can be used for other purposes. Therefore, if even a small portion of the water delivered winds up being used for road watering, lawn and garden irrigation, livestock consumption, or construction, for example, delivery organizations are assessed severe penalties. 
Such uses may be closely related, but technically not interpreted as being, `agricultural purposes.' 
The exemption for overtime pay requirements was placed in the FLSA to protect the economies of rural areas. Irrigation has never been, and cannot be, a 40-hour-per-week undertaking. During the summer, water must be managed and delivered continually. Later in the year following the harvest, the work load is light, consisting mainly of maintenance duties. 
This adjustment would be better for employers, workers, and farmers. It would reflect more accurately the realities of agricultural water delivery. 
Winter compensation and time off traditionally have been the method of compensating for longer summer hours. Without this exemption, irrigators are forced to lay off their employees in the winter. Therefore, this amendment would benefit employees, who would continue to earn a year-round income. It also would keep costs level, which would benefit suppliers and consumers. 
I urge my colleagues to support this modest amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be set aside, and I yield the floor to the Senator from Nevada.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment spoken of by my colleague, Senator Faircloth. The Faircloth-Craig amendment would require that the Secretary of Education certify each year the percentage of Federal moneys used directly for teachers and students. 
The point of the amendment is not the 95 percent figure--it is to draw attention to the vast amount of Federal waste inherent in the Department of Education. Much of what we spend on education each year is lost by Federal managers and bureaucrats. 
Increased spending has done little to advance classroom instruction. Federal spending on education has increased 41 percent since 1989. Yet, per-pupil spending at the school level has increased only 34 percent. The rest has been siphoned off to support the enormous Federal bureaucracy. 
This year's appropriations bill includes a significant increase in education--we don't know yet how much of it will ever see the inside of a classroom. 
Mr. President, teachers in Idaho, and around the country, want to know where their money has gone. I believe we must, in a time of fiscal restraint, examine where each Federal dollar is spent and cut waste wherever it is found. 
The Faircloth-Craig amendment is a sound first step in the right direction.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the second-degree amendment clarifies a few points in the first-degree amendment. As you noticed, the clerk read section (c) which merely discusses time of enactment and time in which the proposed amendment would take effect. What we have here, of course, is the fundamental question that has been brought by the Senator from Oklahoma: Who should pay for the elections of a private union? 
The question fundamentally put before this Senate is very simple for all of us. Should it be the taxpayers or should it in fact be the union? I think we are concluding here that it should be the union in this instance. The taxpayers have done what they should do in this instance and should do no more. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, each year a small portion of the Medicare budget is devoted to HCFA's Office of Research and Demonstrations for Activities that help guide Medicare policymaking on coverage, financing and other operational issues. This year the Appropriations Committee has approved $47 million for this purpose, an increase, of $3 million over the last year. 
The Appropriations Committee has urged the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use a portion of this research budget to conduct a 2-year demonstration project on coverage of medical nutrition therapy by registered dietitians under Medicare part B. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my support for this project and to urge the Secretary to move expeditiously to initiate this program. 
Research has shown that medical nutrition therapy is an effective way to save health care dollars and improve patient outcomes. By reducing and shortening hospital admission, preventing and controlling medical complications and limiting the need for physician follow-up visits, medical nutrition therapy can lower the cost of treating a variety of diseases. Of particular note are the savings that have been documented for patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, two ailments that account for a staggering 60 percent of all Medicare expenditures. 
As we continue efforts to modernize and improve the Medicare Program, we should not overlook medical nutrition therapy as an important way to save program dollars and improve patient treatment options. A demonstration project in this area will help us understand how we can best integrate this important service into any future Medicare improvements.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, along with Senators Johnson, Wellstone, and Grassley, the Biodiesel Energy Development Act of 1997. This legislation is an important step in helping achieve a very important goal of this Nation--that of shifting the focus of national energy demand away from imported oil toward renewable or domestically produced energy sources, as stated in the Energy Policy Act of 1992, also known as EPACT. 
To reach its goal, which is to replace 10 percent of petroleum by the year 2000 and 30 percent by the year 2010 with alternative fuels, EPACT requires Federal and State government fleets, and a limited number of private fleets, to purchase alternative-fueled vehicles [AFV's]. 
Dedicated AFV's are vehicles that can only run on alternative fuels. Natural gas vehicles and electric vehicles are two of the most common AFV's. Flexible fueled vehicles [FFV's] are those vehicles which can run on alternative fuels, such as methanol and ethanol, petroleum fuels, or a combination of the two. 
Current EPACT mandates, incentives, and grants exclude biodiesel fuel blends from being designated as an alternative fuel or from it being an option for controlled fleet owners and operators. EPACT offers little incentive for the use of heavier duty FFV's where biodiesel would be most appropriate, as fleets may obtain credit for heavier duty FFV's only after they have fulfilled their light duty AFV purchase requirements. In addition, EPACT does not allow the conversion and warranty of existing vehicles to FFV standards when they are overhauled or rebuilt. Mr. President, the exclusion of biodiesel as an alternative fuel only impedes the ability of the fleets to meet EPACT mandates. 
Let me spell out some of the benefits that biodiesel provides. Biodiesel is a cleaner burning fuel that is made from natural, renewable sources such as vegetable oils, and is domestically produced. From these facts alone it is evident that the use of biodiesel can reduce the United States' dependence upon imported oil. 
Biodiesel also helps achieve a stated goal of this administration, which is to protect the environment by reducing emissions that may damage the ozone layer and contribute to the greenhouse effect. Biodiesel does just that. When used in a 20-percent blend with petroleum diesel, biodiesel results in a significant reduction in visible smoke and odor and reduces particulate matter by as much as 14 percent. When used in combination with an oxidation catalyst, biodiesel reduces particulate matter by 45 percent, carbon monoxide emissions by 41 percent, and total hydrocarbons by 65 percent. 
Mr. President, biodiesel does all of this without forcing expensive engine modifications, reducing the payload capacity of vehicles, or reducing the range of vehicles. Biodiesel performs similarly to petroleum diesel in terms of torque, horsepower, and miles per gallon. In short, biodiesel performs just as well as petroleum diesel, and yet provides users with all of the benefits of alternative fuels. 
In addition, once the biodiesel market takes off, it is estimated that it could add more than $11 billion to the States that grow oilseed crops. Biodiesel is also biodegradable and nontoxic, resulting in little to no environmental threat. 
The Biodiesel Energy Development Act would solve many of the problems in EPACT, and help fleets reach EPACT's goals. This legislation would designate a biodiesel-petroleum diesel blend as an alternative fuel; equalize incentives between AFV's and alternative fuels; equalize incentives between different types of AFV's; increase the flexibility of EPACT fleet owners and operators in meeting existing mandated AFV purchase requirements; and provide an incentive-based solution regarding flexible-fuel use in AFV's. 
Mr. President, it is time we enabled the fleets that are mandated by EPACT to purchase AFV's with the option of using biodiesel fuel. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in the last Congress, Members in the Senate and our colleagues in the other Chamber worked hard to reform the laws under which the U.S. mining industry operate on the vast Federal lands of the west. Members on both sides of the aisle, from all regions of the country, acknowledged that the Mining Law of 1872 needed change. This body and the other body passed legislation to reform the mining law only to have our efforts vetoed by the President. I believe it is time to make another effort to pass mining reform legislation and to engage the Clinton administration in meaningful discussion that can bring to a close the long and fruitless debate we have so far had on this issue. 
Today, I am introducing, a bipartisan bill in conjunction with Chairman Murkowski, Senator Reid, and Senator Bryan and five other of our colleagues to legislatively solve the problems that we see with the mining law. The Mining Law Reform Act of 1997, is a bill which will ensure continued mineral production in the United States. It provides for a fair economic return from minerals extracted on public lands, and will link mining practices on federal lands to State and Federal environmental laws and land-use plans. This bill provides a balanced and equitable solution to concerns raised over the existing mining law. 
Mining in the United States is an important part of our nation's economy. It serves the national interest by maintaining a steady and reliable supply of the materials that drive our industries. Revenue from mining fuels local economies by providing family income and preserving community tax bases. Mining has become an American success story. Fifteen years ago, U.S. manufacturers were forced to rely on foreign producers for 75 percent of the gold they needed. Today, the U.S. is more than self-sufficient. The combined direct and indirect impact on the economy of our nation by the mining industry in 1995 was almost $524 billion. This is nine times the value of the actual minerals that were mined. Obviously we are talking about a very significant portion of our economy and one that we can not cavalierly assign to the economic antique shed. This information is from a recent report by the Western Economic Analysis Center. I ask unanimous consent that the summary of this report be made a part of the Record. 
Mining, however, is a business associated with enormous up-front costs and marginal profits. Excessive royalties discourage, and in other countries have discouraged, mineral exploration. Too large a royalty would undermine the competitiveness of the mining industry. The end result of excessive government involvement would be the movement of mining operations overseas and the loss of American jobs. The legislation I am introducing today will keep U.S. mines competitive and prevent the movement of U.S. jobs to other countries. 
The General Mining Law is the cornerstone of U.S. mining practices. It establishes a useful relationship between industry and government to promote the extraction of 
minerals from mineral rich Federal lands. Although the cornerstone of this laws was originally enacted in 1872, it remains to function effectively today. The law has been amended and revised many times since its original passage. The legislation I am introducing today preserves the solid foundation provided by this law and makes some important revisions that address the concerns that have been paramount in this debate that I have been involved in for nearly a decade. 
Specifically, the Mining Law Reform Act of 1997 will insure revenue to the Federal Government by imposing fair and equitable fees and a net royalty. It requires payment of fair market value for lands to be mined. It assures lands will return to the public sector if they are not developed for mineral production, as is intended in this legislation. Furthermore, to prevent mining interests from using patented land for purposes other than mining, the bill limits occupancy to that which is only necessary to carry out mining activities. 
To ensure mining activities do not unnecessarily degrade Federal lands, the Mining Law Reform Act mandates compliance with all Federal, State and local environmental laws with regard to land use and reclamation. To enforce these provisions, the bill includes civil penalties and the authority for compliance orders. 
Finally, this bill creates a program to address the environmental problems associated with abandoned mines. Working directly with the States, the Mining Law Reform Act directs fees and royalty receipts to the abandoned mine cleanup programs. It is time we have a workable mechanism to clean up these relics of the past. 
The legislation we are proposing today is in the best interest of the American people because it provides revenue from public resources, assures mines will be developed in an environmentally sensitive manner and that abandoned mines from earlier eras will be reclaimed. It is fair to mining interests because it imposes reasonable fees and royalties, and it is good for the environment because it assures that sound land use and reclamation practices are followed. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation and look forward to hearings and Senate legislative action.

Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for yielding, and let me also recognize him this evening and the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for the work that both Senators have done with their ranking members over the last good many months to craft the legislation that is before us today, tomorrow, and through the balance of the week dealing both with the budget and with tax cuts. 
I rise in support of H.R. 2015, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
Madam President, in 1993 and 1994, we had a President who said balancing the budget probably was a bad thing to do. We had a high administration official who actually had written a book that said it was a loophole whenever children could inherit some of their parents' money. Congress had increased spending and joined with the President in the passing of the biggest tax increase in the history of our country. That was not a decade ago. That was just a few years ago. 
Then came November 1994. And what a difference an election makes. What a great transformation of the mind and the political thought can occur when the American people have spoken and said, `We've had enough.' 
We asked the Congress to change their thinking. And we changed the Congress to think differently. And the first Republican Congress in 40 years began in 1995, with promises to do several very important, necessary things--to reform welfare, to cut back bureaucracy, to balance the budget, and to provide some tax relief for American taxpayers who work hard, have families, and create jobs. 
In 1996, the voters rewarded a Congress and President who accomplished the first two of these items and who promised to bring about the rest. 
This week, the Republican majority in Congress, joined by now many reform Democrats in a bipartisan majority, will deliver on those promises. 
Madam President, this week, as we consider the Balanced Budget Act, and especially the Tax Relief Act of 1997, we are talking about more freedom for more of America's people. 
Freedom is not something that the Government gives the people. Our Nation's founders knew that the people's freedom is, in the words of the Declaration of Independence, `self-evident,' `unalienable,' and `endowed by their Creator.' 
Freedom comes from limiting Government to its necessary functions. Freedom is what remains when Government is not excessively burdensome or coercive. 
This week, we take modest but very significant steps toward restoring freedom to the American people--freedom from the most severe tax burden on families in our Nation's history, freedom from an oppressive national debt, freedom from the growth of an ever-larger, ever-more intrusive Federal Government. 
A couple from Idaho and their four daughters visited my office just this week and we discussed taxes, and particularly death and inheritance taxes. They told to me they run a small farm in Idaho that their great-grandparents had established in 1882. And they reminded me that people turned to Government to take care of them when the Government, usually through taxes, takes away their ability to take care of themselves. 
And as Ronald Reagan said: A Government big enough to promise you everything you need is a Government big enough to take away everything you have. 
The Tax Relief Act that we will begin debating tomorrow, combined with balancing the budget, will help more families take care of themselves the way they want, 
by keeping more of their own hard-earned money; by bringing about the ability to save more for their retirement, their children's education, and other priorities they have; by making it easier to own your own family farm or small business or home; by making it easier to do the kinds of things that Americans like to do, without having to think twice or three times whether they can afford to, or worry whether the Government will take more of their money; by creating, in other words, the economic atmosphere that will allow Americans to invest in creating more and better jobs for themselves, their children, and the future of our country. 
The bills we will pass this week mark the triumph of the principle that the Federal budget should be balanced and should stay balanced. 
In 1994, when the American people spoke so clearly about changing the political thought in this country and the political attitudes, the Dow Jones was hovering at about 3000. Today, it is at 8000. We have, by these efforts to balance the budget and provide tax relief, unleashed a dynamic of this economy that is, without question, historic. 
We are now seeing the reverse of what happened about 40 years ago, when an elite group of liberal economists sold liberal politicians on the idea that you could promise your voters a free lunch. Their intellectual justification was the so-called enlightened discovery that unlimited borrowing could pay for unlimited social spending without much consequence. 
It's easy to understand the political appeal of this proposition. What is incredible is that anyone really believed it, or that they would follow it for nearly 40 years and create a $5 trillion borrowed debt--almost beyond understanding. 
But that is where we are today. That is clearly why the American people have spoken, and that is why this Congress and this Senate finally said we have to change the way we do business. 
You can't borrow your way to prosperity over the long term. We tried and we saw our economy grow even more sluggish. We saw people become even more dependent on Government largess. Thank goodness, Americans, enlightened as they always are, recognizing that they are the Government, took charge and said, `No more.' 
A huge national debt means our Government has spent the last generation mortgaging the future for the next generation. 
That is not a matter of green-eyeshades accounting; it really is an immoral assault on the well-being of our children and their ability to produce for themselves and their prodigies. 
Balancing the budget is not about numbers, it is about people. Balancing the budget means more and better jobs, making it more affordable to buy a home, and more families affording a good education for their children without having to come to the Government and say, please help me. They can do more of it for themselves. Balancing the budget means that essential Federal programs like Social Security and Medicare will be there for those who need it and not become a liability and a burden on future generations. 
There will be more freedom because of a balanced budget, because people will get no more Government than they are willing to pay for. Balancing the budget means Americans--all Americans--win. And we have the actions of the last 3 years now--an economy responding to spending restraint and real efforts to balance the budget and cut taxes--to demonstrate that what I am talking about tonight has a very strong foundation of truth. 
I want to pause for a moment and review one critical reason why we are here this week passing legislation that promises to balance the budget by fiscal year 2002. This die was cast when Congress, by the narrowest of margins, defeated the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
Only the threat of the ultimate legal sanction--a constitutional amendment--and the overwhelming public support for that amendment finally convinced Congress, most important, some of my colleagues and some in the administration, that we had to quit talking the talk and start walking the walk. 
In other words, I have heard so many on the other side throw up their hands and say, we do not need a constitutional amendment to make us balance the budget; all we have to do is do it; all we have to do is exert fiscal responsibility. But we also have to have this program and we have to have that program, and we have to spend here and there. And 2 years running, by one vote, the people almost began to take control of their Government again. It frightened the Congress.

Mr. CRAIG. No, not at this time. I'd like to finish my thoughts. I know that 2 years running, with the House having passed a balanced budget amendment and this Senate missing by just one vote--finally, it is recognized by all in a bipartisan gesture that, the closer the people come to changing their Constitution and exerting that control over Congress, the more motivated Congress becomes in doing it, doing it ourselves, and that is exactly what is occurring here. I believe that, without the constitutional discipline, we will always risk the return to more spending and more borrowing. Ultimately, to safeguard the future, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution must come into place. 
Some may suggest that passage of this year's balanced budget agreement means we no longer need the constitutional amendment. I suggest that is not true. One balanced budget in 30 years hardly means that we have fixed the system or that we have systemically changed the attitude of some who serve here. It will never be easier than it is right now to balance the budget. 
In the past, the temptation always was to put off the hard choices; Members have thought, it will be easier in the future than it is now. But in fact, it will never again be as easy as it is right now to begin that long march to arrest the growth of a $5 trillion national debt. 
That is what the long-term economic and demographic trends tell us. This year's budget discipline and hard choices are nothing compared to what Congress must wrestle with in just the next few years. 
For what we have committed ourselves to tonight and for the balance of this decade will not be easy choices. It was difficult enough to arrive at the agreement that we now have, and I will say, even though I differ sometimes with the President and others, that this is now a bipartisan effort, and I accept that and I honor them in their recognition that, finally, they are willing to offer to the American people what the American people have asked for. 
When we finally pass this balanced budget and then the balanced budget amendment and send it out to the States for ratification--and I believe that will occur in my lifetime and probably within the decade--we will show we understand, as the American people clearly understand, that a nation so indebted ultimately cannot survive, and that to clean up our debt, to balance our budget was ultimately the necessary thing to do. 
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is a mixed bag. I don't support every portion of it. I have reservations about some of it. 
It creates new social spending; it locks in, in the form of entitlements, that social spending. It could use stronger enforcement provisions. For example, I continue to support the idea that caps on spending should extend to spending overall and not only to annual appropriations. It does not address the long-term economic and demographic trends that drive entitlement spending and cry out for reform. 
The chairmen of our committees and some Senators tried hard to get those reforms. That was bipartisan. Some partisans on my side, too, could not accept that. But, ultimately, we will get there. We have to get there. I don't want my grandchildren turning to me and saying, Grandpa, we love you dearly, but we can't afford you and afford to provide for ourselves. We want to buy our own home, educate our children, and we cannot afford the amount of money that would come from our paycheck to go to the Federal Government because that government promised to provide for everyone's future. I don't want that to happen, and the chairman doesn't want that to happen. The future demands that we address it, that we help people prepare themselves for it, and that we will try to do. 
Today, annual discretionary appropriations make up only one-third of the total budget, and that share will continue to shrink. The Kerrey-Danforth entitlement commission of a couple of years ago estimated that in just 14 years, 2011, entitlement spending and interest payments will consume all available tax revenue. That means we will either have to borrow incredible amounts for deficit spending; or go without defense, highways, law enforcement, parks, forestry, education, science, and medical research; or raise taxes to ruinous levels. 
We are not going to do that. We are smarter than that. More important, we wouldn't be here to do it if we tried, because the American people won't tolerate it. They will demand reform before we get to that point, and if we can't give it to them, they will find the candidate willing to do so. 
While this bill before us today does establish another commission to address the need for long-term entitlement reforms, we have already had that kind of commission, chaired by Senator Kerrey of Nebraska. We already know what the current trends are and have some idea of what needs to be done. 
But there is also considerable good in this bill. It does accomplish more in the way of spending control and entitlement reform than many thought possible even a year ago. There are significant repairs to the Medicare System. Medicare will be solvent for at least another decade and will continue to be there for seniors who need it. 
Last, we will begin the process of injecting consumer choice into the system. Why should our seniors not have some of that? The Medicare System, based on market principles, means better care and more economic care. I am always amazed when the bureaucracy thinks it can outperform the marketplace. We know it can't, we know it never has, and, in this instance, we finally recognize that by putting some market principles in. 
The fundamental reforms in last year's historic welfare reform bill will remain in place. We continue to move toward a system that rewards work and allows the States the freedom to develop new and better approaches. 
Enforceable caps on discretionary appropriations spending--virtually the only thing out of the 1990 budget agreement that worked--will continue through the year 2002. 
Overall, the growth in spending will slow by $270 billion over the next 5 years and $1 trillion over the next 10 years, a saving that will be locked in by permanent law and not be subject to year-to-year political whims. 
New spending will be accomplished with a minimum of bureaucracy and a maximum of State flexibility. 
This is far from the ideal balanced budget bill. But it takes the first major step away from demagoguery and toward genuine entitlement reform. It delivers on and locks in the promise of a balanced budget, something I have demanded and worked for my entire time here serving the State of Idaho. 
Why do I demand that? Because the citizens of my State know that a government that continually spends beyond its means, a government that mounts a $5 trillion debt, a government that allows interest on debt to rapidly move toward becoming the largest single item in its budget, is a government that cannot sustain itself. That we recognize. The chairman of our Budget Committee and the chairman of our Finance Committee recognize that. We all recognize that. That is what our party has stood for. That is what the majority here in Congress has demanded because the citizens of our country have said it is a requirement of government. 
I must say that the Balanced Budget Act of this year and the Taxpayers' Relief Act of this year are responses to demands of the American people. I am proud to have been a part of helping craft them. I look forward to the opportunity to vote for them, to cause them to become law, and to see this economy remain dynamic, create jobs, and provide opportunities for this generation and generations to come. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I recognize the bipartisan nature in which this was created, and I support that. I hope that we can sustain that in years to come to truly get our budget in balance and to do so in a way that remains or creates or participates in a vibrant economy. 
There is no question that this effort was accomplished not by us alone but in a bipartisan effort. Certainly the ranking member, who stands here this evening, was a major contributor. And I recognize that. 
I am always a bit surprised when for the 17 years that I have been here I have always heard, `Oh, we don't need to worry about that. We can balance the budget. We have the will to do it.' Well, we didn't have the will until the American people demanded it of us. Now we do have that will. It will only come by a bipartisan effort. I recognize that this evening. I appreciate it. I think it is a great accomplishment, and the Senator from New Mexico is to be congratulated for it. 
I thank both Senators.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to recognize Mr. Chris Yoder, a fellow Idahoan, who will be leaving his professional staff position at the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs to accept a new challenge with the Commission on Service Members and Veterans Transition Assistance. 
A veteran, himself, of the Vietnam War in Army Intelligence, he continued his dedication to the colleagues by serving 13 years with the Veterans Administration in Boise, ID. There he worked in various capacities as a benefits councilor, claims examiner and education specialist. 
Except for the 102d Congress when he worked for the Veterans Affairs, in Washington DC as a staff assistant to the Deputy Secretary, Mr. Yoder has been with the committee for 12 1/2 years. During that time he served with distinction, helping to fashion policies that serve America's veterans. 
He has always accepted challenges, faced them head on and worked diligently in providing the critical answers that have shaped the positive direction the Veterans Committee has taken. 
Mr. Yoder's efforts have always represented his personal commitment to constituents, the veterans service organizations and members of the committee. His timely initiatives and extraordinary abilities will have lasting results for years to come. 
I have high praise for Chris's leadership, dedication, professionalism and accomplishments. On behalf of myself and the veterans of Idaho, we wish him well in his new endeavor, and wholeheartedly thank him for his outstanding service.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues and friend from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, in the introduction of the National Aquaculture Development, Research, and Promotion Act of 1997. 
This important piece of legislation is designed to help make the United States competitive in the expanding world market for aquaculture products. The United States is poised to become the world leader in aquaculture, yet it remains far beyond other nations, including many with fewer resources and less developed infrastructure. 
Already there are more than 1,000 Idahoans whose jobs are either directly or indirectly connected to aquaculture. They represent a $92 million industry for my home State: An industry committed to a cleaner environment, a safer food supply, and community development. 
However, much more lies ahead of us if the United States is to become a world leader in this growing industry. Despite recent growth, America's annual trade deficit in seafood remains stable at approximately $3 billion--a reduction of which could mean a stronger domestic industry, more jobs, and less dependency on others for our food supply. 
Mr. President, it is for these reasons I am pleased to join my colleague in introducing this measure today.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
And let me thank the Senator from Georgia for bringing us to the floor this afternoon to discuss what hopefully by the end of this week will be a bit of history. And I believe it will be the right kind of history, written by the House and the Senate and the White House, that deals with significant tax relief for the American taxpayer and some very major budget reform. 
I have had the privilege of now serving in the Senate a good number of years and also in the U.S. House. And since the early 1980s, I became an outspoken advocate for a balanced budget. I watched as our debt and deficit grew, becoming increasingly alarmed that somehow we would pass on to our children and their children a legacy of debt that would be almost insurmountable, that could cripple the economy of this country and lead us down a road to economic deterioration and a second- or third-rate Nation. 
Because of concern, shared by many here in the Congress, and by a growing number of American taxpayers, throughout the decade of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, we continued that drumbeat to where it is without question a majority sentiment among the American people today, such an overwhelming majority sentiment that in 1994 they changed the character of the U.S. Congress, and they significantly altered the attitude of a President who came to town not to balance the budget and not to give tax relief but to be able to do quite the opposite, to increase the Federal dominance over the American character, to raise taxes, and to continue a liberal Democratic legacy of an ever-increasingly larger Government taking an ever-increasingly larger chunk of the American worker's paycheck. Thanks to Americans, thanks to Republicans, thanks to conservatives, that message got altered. 
Throughout the last several weeks, because of a budget proposal and a tax proposal put together by the Republican leadership and this President, voted on with the substantial bipartisan support of the U.S. Senate, the White House, the Finance Committees, the Budget Committees, along with the leadership, have been in internal negotiations to bring that about, again, reducing the overall size of Government, moving us toward a balanced budget, and for the first time in 16 years giving tax relief to the American people. 
That agreement is not at hand yet, but we are told that that could well become the case this week. And I hope it is. I hope it gives to the American working family the kind of relief they deserve during a period when they are being taxed at the highest rate ever, that it gives to the American investor an opportunity to change the character of his or her investment to create even more jobs, to keep the economy even stronger than it is today for a longer and a more sustained period of time and that says to the less fortunate in our country, you too will benefit, you too will benefit by being able to keep more of your hard-earned dollars. And it says to those who are concerned about education, you can put a little more away to provide for that day when you will want to help your children gain a higher level of education so they can advance themselves in our society. 
All of that is historic. We may, while serving here on a day-to-day, year-to-year basis, lose that perspective, but I do not think the American people will, because we are saying to them, we heard you, we heard you loudly and clearly. And while a marathon race is not won by a single lap around the track, or the Super Bowl is not won by a single victory at the beginning of the season, this is in itself a victory, a significant victory in that long march away from an ever-larger Government that takes more and more away from the average taxpayer, both in his or her earnings and in his or her freedoms. 
So I hope that the work that has gone on the last 2 weeks, in fact, bears fruit. I am excited about the opportunity to debate these issues on the floor of the Senate this week and to vote by week's end on a historic budget package that continues to bring us toward a balanced budget and a historic tax package that offers tax relief to the average taxpayer again for the second time in 16 years. 
So let me again thank the Senator from Georgia for his continued leadership on this issue, coming to the floor day after day to inform the American people about what we are about and what we are striving to achieve, oftentimes behind closed doors because of the nature of the kind of negotiations that have gone on, but must require ultimately in the end to be made public. So let me thank my colleague from Georgia. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding, and let me thank Senator Hagel and Senator Byrd for bringing this resolution to the floor in a timely manner. I know several of my colleagues wish they could have spent a longer period of time this morning debating the issue, and I can't blame them. Let me suggest to them that this is only the beginning of a long and very important debate for our country to become involved in. It also was very important, though, that the Senate of the United States, the ratifying body of our Government and our country, speak out clearly and boldly before the ad hoc climate change negotiating group convenes next Wednesday in Bonn, and carries their meetings through August 8. The reason it is important that the Senate speak out is because we do not believe the sky is falling. We are not sure if the sky is cracked, and if it is, maybe we need to build a superstructure to hold it up. But this country cannot commit itself to this kind of binding agreement unless the science is clearer and the understanding of the American people is fairly reached when it comes to this issue. 
Let me speak for a few moments about my frustration that our President has decided to use his bully pulpit, in my opinion, to terrorize the American people into supporting the administration's quest for commitments for energy use reduction that are legally binding on the United States. The President has been quite frank about building a propaganda campaign about calamities of future global warming, beginning with yesterday's White House meeting on climate change. The President has indicated his propaganda drive will culminate in a White House conference on global warming in October. The conference is not likely to be a thoughtful roundtable. It may now be more thoughtful, because I think the administration has finally recognized that the Senate in fact will become engaged and must become engaged. 
Why did I use the words I just used? Here is the reason. Here is the plan that our administration is now supporting: That they would cause us to enter into a binding agreement that the United States would be responsible for 48 percent of the world's obligation to reduce energy use. We said a long time ago that any climate change agreement that affects the United States should not be binding, but voluntary on the world. Is the administration's plan a dramatic departure from where we were? Here is where it is. It is dramatic because when we arrive at the year 2010, to achieve our 1990 levels, the United States will be contributing about 20 percent of the world's emissions, while the rest of the world will be contributing 80 percent. Yet China and India and other Asian nations and developing countries, by this administration's negotiations, would be exempt. That is why it is time we come to the floor to speak about this. 
Senate Resolution 98, under the authorship of Senator Byrd and Senator Hagel, says just that, that we cannot become involved unless we are all involved and that we should not become involved unless the science is sure, or so sure that we will commit this country and the rest of the world into a course that could bind us and reshape our economies and clearly design a different destiny for the American people than one that we might otherwise choose. 
The President and the Vice President stand next to flooded homes in the Dakotas and suggest that this unfortunate event is a product of global warming. That is not fair, because the science doesn't prove it. So when I use the word `terrorize,' or I use the word `propaganda,' it is not by chance that I use those words. The science simply doesn't support the claims being made by this administration, it is important to understand that. Last year, in the Leipzig Declaration, 100 scientists from around the world, climate scientists--not politicians, but scientists--expressed their doubts about the validity of computer-driven warming forecasts. Why? You heard the Senator from Oklahoma just now say the reason is the science isn't bearing it up. People who watch 
our satellites say that our satellites tell us we are getting cooler. Yet people who watch our ground temperatures suggest we might be getting warmer. Instead of sponsoring a fair debate, the administration is only using part of the available science, while denegrating the other side. 
What is so important for this country to understand, what is more important for the parliamentarians of the world to understand, is that the President does not necessarily speak for this Senate. But what is critically important is that this Senate will speak for itself. And it is, without question, the responsibility of the Senate of the United States to approve treaties. What we do not want to happen is the lifting of the level of expectation projected by the rhetoric and the selective science by an administration that would bring us into negotiations to produce a treaty in Kyoto in December that simply would not speak to the realities or the responsibilities that we ought to be engaged in. 
The administration must realize that a strong American economy is essential to our Nation if we are going to spend upwards of $2 billion a year on climate change research, if we are going to adapt to changing climate, if needed, and if we are going to adjust our economy and our economic base for those purposes. 
So, I am pleased to endorse, and I hope Senators will join with me in a strong endorsement, of Senate Resolution 98. It is important that we speak now. I view, as others do, that this is a preliminary statement in what will be a long and complex debate for all of us to become involved in, because I don't know where our science will lead us. But if it, in fact, can show us the way and clearly demonstrate that there is a climate change responsibility for this Nation, then all the rest of the nations in the world must participate. We cannot shoulder 48 percent of the burden for the rest of the world. 
Mr. President, let me close with this last chart. If you were to turn the United States into a forest with no emissions whatsoever, by the year 2100 here is the problem with the rest of the world. The problem is that we want to be at 1990 levels by 2010. If you take the United States out of the equation, the total concentration of greenhouse gases hardly changes. Yet this administration, at least by their rhetoric of the last several months, would take China out of it, the other developing world nations out, and leave us to bear the burden. That is why S. Res. 98 is so critical for us today, for the world tomorrow, as we march toward Kyoto in December.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Cable News Network announced this week that it would provide live television coverage of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearings on campaign finance activities. But, Mr. President, their decision was based only on the fact that former Republican National Committee chairman, Haley Barbour, is scheduled to testify. 
CNN has been suspiciously absent in its live coverage of the hearings, only allowing its viewers to see the opening statements of the chairman and the ranking member during the past 2 weeks of the hearings. 
As I understand it, CNN based its decision to provide live coverage of Mr. Barbour's testimony on the judgment that he has celebrity status. Or, as CNN's own Washington Bureau chief, Frank Sesno, called them yesterday, `major players'. 
That is a decision more fitting of the program `Entertainment Tonight', instead of a network which prides itself on being the world's leader of news. 
I am certain that I am not the only one disappointed by CNN's decision to forgo live coverage of the hearings. In fact, on CNN's own Internet web page, an overwhelming number of CNN's viewers are distressed over the network's failure to provide live coverage. 
One viewer wrote, and I quote: 
Although I am very pleased that you are carrying the campaign finance hearings through your Web site, I must say after all of the interminable O.J. hearings you carried live on CNN, why on God's earth aren't you carrying the hearings as well? I am very disappointed. 
It was signed by Jim Merrick on July 16. 
Mr. President, there has been such sufficient controversy over the CNN's lack of live coverage of the hearings--and even the lack of regular coverage of the hearings by the other television networks--that CNN devoted a substantial portion of its program `Inside Politics' on Tuesday, to discuss the uproar. 
In a roundtable discussion, where journalists interview each other about what a great job they're doing, CNN's Judy Woodruff asked ABC's Hal Bruno about the difference of these hearings as compared to the Watergate and Iran-Contra hearings. Hal Bruno replied, and I quote: 
Government was at a standstill in Washington as a result of Watergate and the whole country was immersed in it. And the same was true to a lesser degree with Iran-Contra. These were major stories of revelations of criminal wrongdoing. 
Mr. President, Hal Bruno's comment is an outrage. 
For one, the country was immersed in these events because the television networks were carrying the hearings live. 
And furthermore, the campaign finance hearings have uncovered much more serious charges and allegations. They include: Espionage, foreign influence peddling, campaign corruption and even money laundering. Just look at this summary by the staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee on what has been revealed so far during 2 weeks of hearings. 
Hal Bruno's statement is ludicrous, and CNN's lack of live coverage of the hearings proves that they are ignoring a major news story. 
Mr. President, I have written a letter to CNN president, Tom Johnson, and CNN Washington Bureau chief, Frank Sesno, expressing my disappointment and anger over their decision. This is the same network that covered endless hours of the O.J. Simpson murder trial--a news event that affected relatively few Americans. I have not yet received a reply from my letter, and I doubt I will.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding in opposition to the Feinstein amendment and hope that the Senate would concur with the findings of the committee. Commerce, State, Justice appropriations has dealt in what I believe is an appropriate way with the issue of the ninth circuit court. There should be no surprises. This is simply not a new issue. I have always felt, and I think many concur, that if you want to not resolve an issue, you create a commission and study something once again, and we know that this has been studied and recommendations have been made. 
In 1973, the Hruska Commission suggested that the ninth and the fifth circuits be split, and the fifth circuit was split, the ninth was not. There was simply too much political controversy around it. My guess is today it is a lot more about politics than it is about justice, justice to the citizens of our country who deserve a timely process in the courts, and certainly with the ninth circuit court being as large as it is, as other Senators have spoken to this afternoon, justice appropriately and timely rendered is the question. 
It has been mentioned--I believe the Senator from Montana mentioned that the ninth circuit averages 429 days and that the medium national time average is 315 days. When you are in the midst of a lawsuit, do you set it aside? Do you quit spending money? Do you stop the retainer of the attorneys representing you? I doubt it. And that clock ticks on and the money accumulates, and the cost is high and justice goes unrendered. 
Then the question in this very extended court is to whether the justice is appropriate. The Senator from Utah referenced the number of times the Supreme Court this year has overruled the ninth circuit. Those are all part of the issues that brought the citizens of Idaho to me and to my colleague, Senator Kempthorne, to suggest that it was time we dealt with this issue, that it had been since 1973 that the issue was found to be one of division, one of the appropriate allocation of States, money, and judges, and that simply has not occurred. 
I hope that we would deal with this. 
The bill before us today would put California, Nevada, Guam, and the Northern Marianas in the ninth circuit. It would also create a new twelfth circuit including Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington. I am currently a cosponsor of Senator Murkoswki's bill, S. 431, which splits the ninth circuit a little differently. However, I find the division in the Gregg-Stevens amendment to be very well though out and fair. I think either split of the ninth circuit would work much better than the current organization of the ninth circuit. 
The subject of dividing the ninth circuit split has been discussed now for many years. In fact, as long as 1973, the Hruska Commission suggested the ninth and fifth circuits should be split. Although the fifth circuit was divided, the ninth was not. Ever since then, the debate about splitting the ninth circuit has roared on. 
Frankly, Mr. President, I am perplexed why there is any question about this proposal. The ninth circuit is by the largest circuit in the United States. It currently employs 28 judges--11 more than any other circuit. The U.S. Judicial Conference has called any circuit with more than 15 judges unworkable. I guess that means, in the opinion of the Judicial Conference, we have an unworkable situation. 
The ninth circuit currently serves 45 million people. This is 60 percent more than the next largest district. The Census Bureau has estimated that by 2010, the population in the ninth circuit will top 63 million people, an increase of 40 percent. The situation has worsened since the Hruska Commission suggested a split of the ninth circuit--a trend certain to continue with further delay. 
Over the years of debate on this issue, there has been much discussion of inconsistency and unmanageable caseloads. I would like to change the focus of the argument for just a moment and instead look at the impact on the people of the ninth circuit, which includes the people of Idaho. The size of the ninth circuit also has quite an effect on these individuals. 
The ninth circuit averages 429 days from filing to concluding an appeal. This is much longer than the national median time of 315 days. This affects the individuals who resort to the judicial system to resolve a dispute in their lives. It's been said that people in this country want and expect swift, efficient justice and I think they deserve it. 
It is not fair for the people in the ninth circuit to be subjected to this inefficiency. People want their disputes to be solved quickly so they can go on with their lives. A lawsuit has the ability to consume everything else in one's life. In the ninth circuit, it consumes their lives for a longer period of time. Also, during this extended process, these individuals are forced to continue paying legal fees. Mr. President, I ask you if 100 extra days in litigation sounds like swift justice. 
The huge backlog that develops can lead to different sorts of problems in the Northwest. The economic stability of the Northwest is threatened when suits involving, for example, the timber industry are forced into the backlog of inefficiency. 
It is unquestioned that the ninth circuit covers a huge area. However, when that is combined with the 7,000 new filings the circuit had last year, it becomes almost impossible to keep abreast of legal developments in the circuit. The result is everchanging judicial patterns that inevitably make conflicting rulings. This leads to judicial inconsistency, which is not good for the system, or the people who seek relief through the system. This might help to explain the fact that the ninth circuit has an 82 percent rate of reversal by the Supreme Court of the United States. Mr. President, I ask you if this sounds like efficient justice. 
Opponents of this legislation argue that the extreme size and population of the ninth circuit is not enough of a reason to support a split. However, that was the exact reason for the split of the former eighth circuit, which created the tenth circuit. It was also the exact reason for dividing the fifth circuit and creating the eleventh circuit. In fact, as I said before, when the fifth circuit was split, it was suggested that the ninth circuit be split as well. 
Opponents also argue for the need of a new commission to determine the need for a split of the ninth circuit. Twenty-five years ago the suggestion of just such a commission was to split the ninth circuit. It has grown since then, and is continuing to grow. The proposed split has been discussed for many years now, including Senate Judiciary hearings. There is more than enough data currently in the record to make an informed decision, and that decision should be to split the ninth circuit. 
Mr. President, this situation has been a long time in coming. It is now time for us to act. The split of the fifth circuit worked 25 years ago, so there is no reason we should not expect similar success with the ninth circuit. It is time that we recognize the competing interests of the differing regions in the ninth circuit and split them up. I ask that my colleagues support the split of the ninth circuit in the interest of returning swift, efficient justice to the people of the ninth circuit.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment relative to the inspection of equipment used in the production of agricultural products. For years, FSIS has inspected and certified all equipment used in processing agricultural products. However, FSIS announced on May 2, 1996, its intent to discontinue its prior approval process. 
While the FSIS proposal is still pending, no system of prior approval has been developed anywhere at USDA. 
Mr. President, the Craig amendment would establish a fee for service system for equipment inspection within AMS, which currently inspects processed agriculture products. Let me stress: The system would be entirely voluntary. Those equipment manufacturers who choose to participate would pay for the service and, if the equipment qualifies, become AMS certified. 
This proposal is self-funding and would use the existing trust fund established in section 203(h) of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946. By providing a certification process to replace the FSIS system, the amendment would both reduce the risk that unacceptable equipment could be purchased and installed in processing plants and enhance exports of processing equipment. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the support of the managers of the bill in adopting this amendment.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Graham, to introduce the Imported Produce Labeling Act of 1997. 
For the past 67 years, since Congress passed the Tariff Act of 1930, almost everything imported from abroad has been labeled as to its country of origin. Guidelines now exist for products of virtually every kind--from clothing and toys to prepared food. Pick up almost anything in your local supermarket or department store and you're likely to see its country of origin clearly displayed. 
This is sound trade policy, which has served our Nation well. It is now time, Mr. President, to extend these same labeling requirements to imported produce. 
Currently, containers carrying imported produce from abroad are required, by the same Tariff Act of 1930, to be labeled as to where that produce was grown and packed. This information makes it possible for American importers, shippers, and retailers to know the produce's country of origin. However, that information is never revealed to the consumer. 
What this legislation would require, Mr. President, is for this important information, already in the hands of our retailers and shippers, be passed on to those who ultimately purchase and consume the imported produce. We're asking, quite simply, for retailers to let the American consumer know what they're eating and where it was produced. 
The United States imports approximately 1.7 billion dollars' worth of fruit and vegetables every year. Almost all of this produce is purchased and consumed by unsuspecting shoppers who have no idea where, or under what conditions, it was grown. 
While some might claim these new labeling requirements are unfair or burdensome, these claims are simply not true, and aim to distract the real issue: the consumer's right to know. 
I would point out to these critics, Mr. President, that most of our international trading partners already require such labeling. While I won't take the time to read the names of all these nations now, I would like to draw your attention to two of those with the strictest labeling requirements, Canada and Mexico--our two closest trading partners.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is about time we start giving American consumers the same information granted in these other nations. 
Likewise, this legislation is not overly burdensome. The bill provides for a wide variety of labeling options, any number of which might be easily employed by American retailers to display information they already know. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to consider this legislation seriously. It is time to close the gap of knowledge that currently exists relative to where imported produce is grown. American consumers have the right to know where their food came from and, given the opportunity, will use that information to protect and provide for their families.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to grant congressional consent to the Pacific Northwest Emergency Management Arrangement entered into between the States of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington and the Provinces of British Columbia and the Yukon Territory. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that so many of my colleagues from the Pacific Northwest have joined me in cosponsoring this important legislation. 
This agreement, negotiated and signed by the Governors of the four Pacific Northwest States and their colleagues in Canada, would significantly improve multi-State and binational cooperation during the response phase of natural disasters in the Northwest. In addition, it would provide for region-wide civil defense coordination and guarantee residents of each State emergency services. The agreement does this while protecting the individual sovereignty of each State and Province. 
Mr. President, given the impact of recent natural disasters across the Pacific Northwest, my colleagues can easily understand why this measure is so important. I hope the Senate will act quickly in seeing this measure approved without delay.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the gentleman from Washington State and to add my request that this body go on record in clear support of the Department's Plutonium Disposition Program. In particular, the Department should be commended for all its fine work leading to the January Record of Decision, which chose two options for the disposition of the excess weapons plutonium. These two options--immobilization and use of mixed oxide [MOx] fuel in existing reactors--will set the pace for parallel activities in the former Soviet Union. We should encourage the Department now to implement this decision in an expeditious manner, for the sake of world peace and stability. In particular, we understand that the Department intends to begin the process of selecting the suite of industrial partners that will carry out the MOx Program. I look forward to the fruits of that labor, and strongly encourage the Department to move out expeditiously. Accomplishments in this program can do a lot toward world security, not to mention what it can do for DOE's image and reputation at home and abroad.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in 1988, I helped my colleague from Colorado, Senator Campbell, develop and pass the Colorado Ute Water Settlement Act. It was fair and responsible at that time to deal with a dispute that could only be dealt with in the nature that we solved it with this legislation. 
From that point to now, there has been discussion and dispute and a substantial scaling down of this project. In the high deserts of the West, water is everything. If my colleague from Wisconsin lived in the deserts of the West, he would be scrambling to secure water for his people. He doesn't live there. He doesn't understand the importance of this very, very critical water issue. 
This is a balanced compromise with all parties sharing. These Indians, these native Americans without water can find it very, very difficult to eke out an existence, whereas, with water, they have an opportunity with agriculture to prosper and develop their lands. That is what this issue is all about. 
Let us keep our word and our promise. Let us develop an understanding that when we, from the West, come to our colleagues asking for the development of water in the high deserts, that we work cooperatively with them to do so, as we worked with our colleagues from the upper Midwest to secure flood control and those kinds of things where they have an abundance of water and we have little to no water. 
This is the important issue. I hope the amendment will be rejected by the Senate, recognizing the promises and the commitments made and the kind of cooperative relationship we have with all of our colleagues, where one has an abundance of water; in this instance, we have little to no water. Therefore, to secure, to maintain, to ensure an environment, to actually increase the abundance of wildlife, one must catch and store the water when it is available, and that is what this is all about. Not only for resource use, for environmental reasons, but most assuredly to enhance the ability of native Americans in this instance to improve their lot and to gain what is responsibly and rightfully theirs. 
So I hope that my colleagues will reject this amendment and get on with the commitment we made in 1988 for this very important water project.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me tell the Senator from Wisconsin, it is not my intent to impugn his integrity. I am simply saying when you live in a State with an abundance of water, your feelings about water are different. My colleague's State of Arizona is abundant with water today as a desert because this Congress saw fit to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into water development in his State, and his State is the great beneficiary of those programs today. 
Whether you agree or disagree, the reality is, Arizonans know how to allocate water resources most effectively. But the Ute Indians have not had that opportunity, and I am simply saying that when you are in a high desert, you recognize that if 
human life is to exist, it exists only in the presence of water. 
I think my colleague understands that, but having been born and raised in the high deserts of the West, I think there is an understanding and appreciation that is sometimes difficult to convey, and that was my intent.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to address a provision of S. 1004, the appropriations bill for energy and water development for fiscal year 1998. I refer specifically to the President's request for a new initiative within the Department of Energy, called nuclear energy security. The bill before us contains no funding for this new initiative. I wish to address my colleagues on the reasons for the subcommittee's treatment of this initiative and the direction in which I believe the Department should focus its nuclear energy research and development program. 
The committee report to accompany S. 1004 states that although the committee supports the use of nuclear energy to produce electricity, the Department's proposed program to address technical issues will have insufficient impact to justify the expense and therefore, no funding was provided. I am concerned that the Department of Energy will take the wrong message from this action. 
It is my view, as a member of the Appropriations Committee and as a member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, that this country needs a viable nuclear energy program--both for our energy security and for our national security. Recently, the President commissioned his Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, Energy Research and Development Panel to study and report back on whether the United States should have a nuclear energy program and if so, what its goals should be both domestically and internationally. A lot of good work on this issue has been done, or is underway within the Department of Energy and the national laboratory complex. Specifically, Sandia National Laboratories, in New Mexico has contributed substantially. 
While I won't delineate the findings at length at this time, let me just indicate to my colleagues, that the greatest minds that we have nationally to weigh in on this question have done so, and they believe that the failure to have a strong nuclear energy research and development program will diminish our national security, our economic competitiveness, and the public well-being. The bottom line is that as our primacy in nuclear R&D declines, we will lose our ability to participate on the world stage and to observe and understand the civilian nuclear programs of emerging nations. 
For these reasons, it is my hope that the Department will continue to construct, and will propose as appropriate, a nuclear energy program that fulfills these goals.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my amendment would change the current pay-go procedures by establishing a 60-vote point of order against using tax increases to pay for new mandatory spending increases. My amendment is the first step toward reining in the uncontrolled costs of mandatory spending programs that I believe threaten our fiscal future. This budget should have gone further in entitlement reform and it should not have added more entitlement spending, but there is one reform that should be made definitely, and that is to cause no further harm. 
My amendment will not affect a single current beneficiary of a single existing entitlement program. My amendment will not affect a single person who will qualify to become a beneficiary under the current requirements of any existing entitlement program. My amendment will not prevent the creation of a new entitlement program if there is a true need for the program. It simply will require that such a need be truly demonstrated. 
My amendment will not prevent a tax increase that is used for deficit reduction. 
What my amendment will do is put an end to the fiction that tax increases are capable of offsetting the cost of additional mandatory spending.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, several assertions have been made on the floor this morning that this is not a tax increase if we repeal this depletion allowance. It was also suggested that mining companies don't pay taxes. Wrong, wrong, and wrong again. 
The average mining company pays 32 percent tax with minimum alternative. This would increase it to over 42 percent. I would like to inform the Senator from New Hampshire that mining companies invest about $400 million in each mining operation. He is raising taxes on mining companies that employ thousands of people, in one of the highest paid wage industries in the Nation. He is also attacking the very industrial base of our country. When you come from a State where you have to pledge not to raise taxes, I guess you can raise them if there is some political advantage to do so. That appears to be the case here this morning. 
It is all politics, with no sensitivity toward the strength of the industrial base of this country and the opportunity to continue to provide strong high-paying jobs in the public land States of our Nation.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I would like to take a few moments to pay tribute to Flip Kleffner who, after a long and distinguished career as University of Idaho alumni director, will be retiring June 30. 
I take a personal interest in his retirement because, as a fellow University of Idaho graduate, I've been the beneficiary of all his work. 
Flip has served as alumni director for the past 15 years and has been involved with the University of Idaho most of his life. He is a former student body president and was a standout athlete who excelled at basketball, baseball, and football. In fact, he still holds the school record for the longest punt at 82 yards. 
Flip has always made everything he does a very personal effort. In that regard, he's a tremendous example of how one person really can make a difference. He has quietly given countless hours of volunteer service to his community--in everything from youth sports to education--without expecting anything in return. 
In addition, his efforts to continually improve the quality of education in Idaho have helped the State keep its best and brightest at home. 
Flip has a wonderful sense of humor and is one of the most personable, pleasant people I have ever had the privilege of knowing. He will be greatly missed at the university, but I'm confident he'll remain an active force for good on campus--even in retirement. 
He has had a remarkable career and I wish him all the best now as he enters this new chapter in his life.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Alaska and the two Senators from Nevada in our commitment and belief that the 1872 mining law deserves to be reformed. These four Senators have worked for the last 4 to 5 years to bring responsible and sensitive reform to this old, but very important, law, a law that has served our country well on public lands that allows an individual to go forth to explore, to discover and to develop the mineral wealth of our country. 
It is also important to recognize that this is a public resource, and there needs to be an appropriate balancing act in the effective utilization of a public resource and a return to the taxpayer of the value of that resource. 
Because the 1872 mining law was really intended at a very early time in our country's history to be a development law that allowed growth and development primarily in the public lands of Western States, I, a Western Senator, along with the Senator from Alaska and the two Senators from Nevada as Western Senators, saw a need, along with a good many others of our colleagues, to provide good reform to this old law to allow the mining industry to go forth, to assure there would be a right to discover, a right to develop, but to do all of that in the context of sound environmental policy and, for the first time, to propose a royalty on hard-rock mining; also, to recognize that there was a surface value that is no longer there and an absolute sense of a need to develop western lands. So, therefore, there ought to be a market value placed on the surface rights that one gained as they gained title through the patenting process which allowed that public resource to go to private utilization. 
But for 4 years, this administration has literally refused us the right to do that. This Senate passed mining law reform. It was in the budget reconciliation 2 years ago, and the President vetoed it. So for the Senator from Arkansas to stand on the floor this evening and say there has been no meaningful mining law reform isn't quite true. There has been a very aggressive effort on the part of this Senator; the Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee; the Senator from Louisiana, now retired, Senator Johnston, who was the chairman of that committee; and, of course, the Senators from Nevada who understand the importance of mining, as I do, because it is a critical part of their economic base and the resource development in their State. 
The Senator from Arkansas has another vision of mining. It is called no-mining. For some reason, he believes that this is a source of wealth to the Treasury of this country, and when he sees millions of dollars invested, somehow he immediately equates that as millions of dollars returned to the Treasury, when the fact is that while money can be returned to the Treasury, it takes an average of $400 million to develop an operating mine today, to make sure it is in compliance with the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, to make sure it meets the NEPA requirements, to make sure it is operated in a sound environmental way, while returning a profit to the company and to the investors that put up the nearly $400 million for that development. 
Unlike other kinds of resources, minerals are not sold in Little Rock at a Little Rock value or Boise, ID, at a Boise 
value. They are sold in Little Rock or in Boise based on a world value, a world market, because gold and silver and iron, zinc and lead, and all of those kinds of things that make up the fundamental base of the industrial society that we enjoy are traded in a world environment. 
When that price slips, so it slips at the mine. A mine that one year can be very profitable, the next year can be very unprofitable and can lose money. That has been and is the history of mining in our country. You talk about striking it rich, that happens in mining, but I also know a lot of miners who struck it poor. 
A mining company in our State just a year ago called me and said they wanted me to know that they were shutting down a major mining operation in one of the counties in the State of Idaho. Why? After they had invested millions of dollars, their exploration didn't pan out to be quite what they thought it ought to be. Their drilling didn't determine the projections of the ore body that existed. So they were shutting it down and walking away and writing off millions and millions of dollars of cost in the development of a mill and a plant and a site and all of those necessary tools to bring that mineral out of the ground to the smelter in a refined way. 
I say nothing new on the floor of the Senate tonight. I only bring current the 200-plus-year history of the mining industry of our Nation. 
But reform is necessary, and this Senator, along with the Senator from Alaska--the two Senators from Nevada have just authored a new mining law reform approach. We sat down with the Senator from Arkansas and his staff to try to see if we could not build a bipartisan compromise. That hasn't happened yet, and we want that to happen. We believe in the reform. 
But what the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas proposes tonight is not constructive. It doesn't add to the overall effort to build strong mining law for this country that allows continued development in an environmentally sound way, to build the resource and the wealth base of our Nation and to assure a domestic supply of minerals and metals. 
It does quite the opposite. It goes directly at mining industries in this country, and it could very well render them marginal and, in some instances, less than profitable. When that happens, the mining industry doesn't stay around. It very quickly closes its doors and the average job of $46,000 a year goes wanting, and that mining industry goes to Peru or to Chile or to Colombia or to Ecuador or to Mexico to build the wealth base of those countries and to deny us the $100 billion industry that we have here. 
I don't think that makes good sense. I never have. And I can't understand the thinking of the Senator from Arkansas in that regard, other than he just appears to have it out for the mining industry. 
In my State, it is an important industry. Nationwide, it is tens of thousands of very high-paying jobs, and there is no question that this industry contributes a great deal to our country and hundreds of millions of dollars to the economy on an annualized basis. 
The mining industry already pays taxes. Somehow, because they are able to patent public resources and then develop them, the Senator from Arkansas suggests they pay nothing, they `get a free ride.' That one example on the bottom line of the chart of the Senator from Arkansas is an Idaho-based operation. There may be a billion dollar's worth of reserves in the ground, but that operation isn't operating today. They are not functioning, and the reason they are not is that they are not current in the economy of the marketplace. They may have invested millions of dollars, and they may have paid the Federal Government through the process of the $2.50 an acre surface value in the patenting process, but they are not returning any money today, and their mine sits idle. That is not unusual. That is the way the mining industry works. That is the way it has always worked. My guess is it won't change. 
The mining industry already pays an average in Federal taxes at 32 percent, according to the General Accounting Office. Because of the corporate alternative minimum tax, they currently pay a very high rate. But the Senator from Arkansas says, `Whoop, that's not good enough, stick them again 8 to 10 percent.' So we get them up to 42 percent. Why do you want to pay 42 percent on your income flow if you can move across the border and pay less? That is exactly what has happened. The Senator from Alaska and the Senators from Nevada spoke very clearly about that in their past statements. The exodus out of this country of the mining industry and the jobs and the expertise and the engineering that flows with it is a tragedy to which we shouldn't contribute. 
So I hope that Senators will recognize that we shouldn't be legislating more in relation to this tax bill that we have before us. This comes outside of the agreement. We have worked very hard, and, I must say, the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Finance Committee have done what I think is an excellent job in working to stay inside an agreement that the leadership of the Senate and the House and the President struck as it related to revenue and tax relief. 
Tax relief ought to be creating jobs, it ought to be promoting economic development, it ought to be growing our economy instead of shrinking it, instead of destroying thousands of jobs that I believe this kind of legislation and the Bumpers amendment would accomplish. 
I have before me a chart that talks about the combined direct and indirect contribution of the metals mining industry to the economy of the individual States of this Nation. I could go through that, but here is the bottom line, Mr. President. 
The bottom line is $134,378,000,000 a year. Is that in the pocket of some mining executive? Absolutely not. It is in the work force of Caterpillar equipment in Illinois. It is spread across the country in the supplies and the direct and indirect services that provide for the mining industry. It is in the chemical industry of Delaware. 
I am amazed, but I look down here and see that in Connecticut alone is $1,792,000,000--Connecticut--directly attributable to the mining industry of the country. I did not know there was a mine in Connecticut. Well, there probably is not, but there are major corporate headquarters and there are suppliers, and those suppliers create jobs. 
Of course, when you have a broad-based industry like metals and mining, all States benefit. Literally every State in the Nation has nearly $100 million or more in value of directly associated or related jobs to the metal and the mineral industry of our country. 
That is why we should not be stepping forward in some form to destroy it. We ought to be promoting it. Most importantly, the Senator from Arkansas ought to be working with the Senators from Nevada and from Idaho and from Alaska to get reform that we all want so that the mining industry of the country can know the ground on which it operates and the law to which it must comply. That is what we ought to be about. 
So I hope that tomorrow when we vote on the Bumpers amendment, we can vote it down, recognizing that when we deal with reform in the mining industry, let us deal with it in a comprehensive way in the appropriate authorizing committee with the hearings that are necessary to make sure that what we do fits so that we do not wound an industry that has provided for us well and that continues to employ tens of thousands of people across our country and provide well over $100 billion annually to the wealth base of this country. That is the issue. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to report a sad event in my State of Idaho that claimed the lives of two Guardsmen: Maj. Don Baxter of Boise, commander of the 124th Communications Flight, 124th Wing of the Idaho Air National Guard, and 1st Lt. Will Neal of Picabo, platoon leader with A Company, 1st-183 Aviation Battalion Army National Guard in Boise. 
They were flying reconnaissance over the floods in southwest Idaho where their helicopter crashed. As the natural disaster rages through Idaho, as the communities band together, as we strive to save lives and property, we now must struggle with the reality that these men lost their lives, and CWO Shellby Wurthrich, with A Company, 1st-183 Aviation Battalion Army National Guard of Boise, is still fighting for his life. 
These distinguished men had served their State and communities before. Major Baxter, a full time Guardsman, received many decorations, including the State of Idaho Emergency Ribbon in support of the Fire Suppression in 1994. Lieutenant Neal, a cattleman, received amongst his numerous decorations, the Army Commendation Medal, Army's Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and twice Army Reserve Component Medal. He was also airborne qualified. 
A neighbor who saw the crash, without fear for her life, Ms. Sherry Lang, risked her own life to rescue Chief Warrant Officer Wurthrich before the helicopter exploded into flames. The heroism she displayed exemplifies the spirit of a community pulling together. 
Chief Warrant Officer Wurthrich, recipient of the Army Commendation Medal, Army's Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, twice, Army Reserve Component Medal, and many other decorations, is today being transferred to a burn treatment center in Utah. We pray for his strength during his recovery and ask everyone to remember him in the weeks and months to come. 
As we mourn for the deceased, we mourn our loss and we sympathize with the sorrow of the bereaved. We search for the good things to remember as solace. Most of the richness of the human experience is in what is handed down from one to another--not things of wood and stone, but memories of what they did or said or felt. 
We must remember and emulate these individuals for the best of their lives. As National Guardsmen, they sought out opportunities to safeguard and help the people of Idaho, in times of disasters and distress. With every mission, they risked of danger and injury. Ultimately, they gave their lives in helping their neighbors and their community. 
This is why Idaho mourns their deaths and grieves with their families and understand their loss, for it is our loss, too. We will remember them and their heroic efforts. Life ends, but memories live on.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank you very much. 
I stand this morning to join my colleague, the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], in the introduction of a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on climate change negotiation. 
The Senator from West Virginia and I agree that the administration needs to understand the Senate is very concerned about the potential adverse consequences of the proposed changes to the U.S. Framework Convention on Climate Change to which this body gave its consent shortly after it was signed by President George Bush at the Rio de Janeiro conference in 1992. 
I hope this resolution will be a much needed wake-up call to the administration about the seriousness of the Senate's views on its current negotiating position. I do not think it was proper for this administration to change the position of the United States from a voluntary approach that was endorsed by the entire developed world to a legally binding treaty to impose enforceable greenhouse gas reduction targets by a date certain. 
I am particularly concerned the administration did not consult with Congress prior to taking this new position which I am told was reached in the early morning hours of the last day of the Berlin negotiations. Subsequently, the administration has not sought, and certainly not received, consensus support from the Senate on its new approach. 
The attitude of this administration toward honest scientific inquiry is very troubling. I do not approve of using political science instead of real science. Mr. President, let me repeat that. I do not approve of this administration's use of political science instead of the real science that is critically necessary when negotiating and understanding an issue of this importance. 
It is outrageous that this administration has been running around the country and the whole world, for that matter, claiming, as Deputy Secretary Tim Wirth has done on a number of occasions, that as far as the scientific hypothesis that human activity is warming the planet is concerned, `the debate is over.' 
Instead of fairly testing that hypothesis, this administration is using its $1 billion-plus annual budget to try to prove only that carbon dioxide is warming the planet and to discredit any studies that might appear legitimate to the contrary. 
The Earth has warmed about a degree centigrade since the depths of the of the Little Ice Age of the early 1600's. All but a tiny amount of that increase occurred prior to World War II before significant human loading of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In fact, the world's scientists are still debating the extent, if any, to which human emissions of carbon dioxide rather than predominantly actual causes are actually increasing Earth temperatures. 
There is agreement on one point, however: That any future change in world temperature caused by human activity will be slight and there is no reason to rush to a new agreement in Kyoto in December of this year. 
Finally, Mr. President, it is unacceptable that this administration has refused to admit the details of its proposal or to release any analyses of the anticipated impact of the proposal. The administration has not revealed to us what kinds of differences its proposal would actually have on global temperatures. 
The administration's negotiators have refused to release any of their internal economic studies that show huge decimation in the industrial sector of our economy. One can only assume that it is to ensure that they will have free rein to commit the United States to whatever they decide to do in the early morning hours of the last day of the Kyoto conference in December. This kind of secret planning and hidden agenda is contrary to a democracy, and, Mr. President, it is just flat wrong. 
The administration should immediately start a more public debate and a more honest consultation with the Senate, which, after all, has the final say on whether the United States will be legally bound to any international agreement. A great time to begin to bring this position into the sunshine will be during the Foreign Relations Committee's hearings scheduled for next week by my colleague and the prime cosponsor of the resolution that is coming to the floor this morning, Senator Hagel. So I look forward to a more open and honest airing of the issue. 
I see the Senator from West Virginia is in the Chamber and let me again thank him for his leadership in the authoring of this very important sense-of-the-Senate resolution on global climate change. I am proud to be a sponsor and to work with him on this effort. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, yesterday was the 100th anniversary of the passage of the Forest Service's Organic Act, so it is an appropriate time to reflect on how recent Congresses have addressed Forest Service issues. 
Let me also say to my colleagues, yesterday had sent to each one of your offices a book by Douglas MacCleery called `The American Forests: A History of Resiliency and Recovery.' 
During the 104th Congress, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee conducted the first extended series of oversight hearings on the management of our Federal forests in almost 20 years. As these hearings proceeded, we also consulted with experts in the field of forestry management, participated in and evaluated the results of the Seventh American Forest Congress, and asked the General Accounting Office and others to evaluate the current state of the management of our national forests. As a consequence of these efforts, we have formed some conclusions about the management of our national forests, and today I would like to share these with my colleagues. 
Notwithstanding considerable contemporary controversy, the Forest Service remains a top performer among Federal agencies. The breadth of contemporary controversy over Federal forest management and the cacophony of interest group outcries from all ends of the spectrum tend to obscure the simple fact that much of the time the Forest Service carries out its duties quite effectively. 
Over the decade, the quality of management employed on our Federal forests have been reflected in the integrity of the resources involved. Since the turn of the century, and particularly over the last several decades, the science of resource management has improved dramatically. Our federally owned forests are arguably managed under the most advanced scientific principles and the most stringent environmental controls that have been applied to any managed ecosystem in the world. 
In a historic context, the return on this investment in scientific management is striking. Many Federal forests which some view today as pristine ecological preserves were, earlier in this century, little more than worn-out farm lots. Species of megafauna which were dangerously close to extinction at the turn of the century are now flourishing on our Federal forests. 
The National Forest System provides more recreation opportunities than any other land ownership category in the country. Wood from our national forests made a significant contribution to the American dream of affordable housing for post-war America, and must still continue to make an important contribution to our national fiber needs today. 
The heat generated by present-day conflicts over Federal forest management makes it easy to forget that our national forests are century-long success stories. But this perspective is essential to retain as we go about the task of addressing contemporary problems and improving on our performance in forest resource management. 
Notwithstanding the barrage of negative publicity generated by the pleadings of special interests, I remain highly impressed by the commitment of Forest Service professionals of all disciplines and at all levels. Moreover, after more than 15 hearings on an array of related subjects, I am convinced that the majority of people--those not vested in a particular resource management outcome--are, after a reasonable opportunity to offer their thoughts, prepared to defer to the judgment and expertise of the Forest Service in resource management decisions. In this regard, I have reached four specific conclusions from our oversight. 
First, budget reductions and downsizing have left the agency with significant management problems. Throughout the system their are national forests with critical gaps in resource management expertise and/or personnel shortages. I have come away from our oversight convinced that we simply must find a way to provide the agency with the resources to do the job we want done. I urge my colleagues to join me in this search. 
Second, despite these current fiscal constraints and various and sundry controversies, the spirit of Forest Service employees remains surprisingly strong. This spirit shone through in much of the testimony received from agency employees, particularly during field hearings. I believe we must act now to avoid squandering this endangered resource. 
Third, the breadth and quality of resource and environmental expertise within the Forest Service, even stressed by budget constraints, is nonetheless unique among related Federal agencies. For example, I have come to conclude that the Forest Service's specialists possess: as much or more expertise in endangered species conservation as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; as much or more expertise in managing anadromous fish habitat as the National Marine Fisheries Service; and as much or more expertise in maintaining or restoring water quality in rural, forested watersheds as the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Fourth, in response to probative questions, we finally began to hear the acknowledgment, from other Federal agencies that this expertise exists and that the Forest Service could, in their view, be trusted to use it. I am not convinced that their actions yet reflect these words, but I was glad to hear them, nonetheless. 
Most people still strongly support multiple-use management despite well publicized assertions to the contrary. After listening to over 200 witnesses from all quarters, I have come away convinced that we should continue to use our federally owned forests for a wide variety of purposes as long as these activities do not damage the lands. I believe that the majority of the populace agrees that we should protect wildlife habitat, allow recreation, permit harvesting of trees, grazing of animals, and development of minerals on these lands, and that these activities--if conducted judiciously--can be compatible. I do not believe that the `zero harvest,' or `cattle free' philosophies are as widely supported as their proponents maintain. For example, at the seventh American Forest Congress, the 1,500 participants voted 91 percent to 4 percent to defeat an extremist proposal to eliminate commercial harvest on public lands. 
Moreover, I also strongly suspect from what we heard that most people believe that the way to decide the best mix of uses on Federal forests lands is to give the Forest Service--particularly the resource professionals on the ground--as broad and independent a responsibility as possible to conduct studies, develop comprehensive plans, consult with the public, and then implement the results. Unfortunately, most of the developments in contemporary resource policy over the past 15 years have worked to reduce the forest Service's responsibility. 
That is why last December, I began circulating comprehensive revisions to the 1976 statutes that govern the management of our Federal forest lands. These statutes have not been changed since Congress passed them two decades ago and are in dire need of modernization. The world that we face today is much different than the one we faced in 1976, even as it is different than the one that we faced in 1897. 
Over the course of the last 4 months I have held a series of six informal workshops on the draft that was circulated for the first time last December. These workshops included representatives from all points of view, and were conducted to be as informal and discoursive as possible in hearing all points of view. Since concluding these workshops a few weeks ago, we have been reworking our proposal for introduction this summer. I hope that we can, in this centennial year of the passage of the original Organic Act, make some positive changes--in a bipartisan fashion--that will provide a mandate to carry sustained and enlightened forest stewardship forward for another century.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to add in a small way to the many tributes being offered on behalf of one of our colleagues. 
There are persons lucky enough to witness history, and persons wise enough to study history. Then there are those few who are dynamic enough to make history. 
This week we honor someone who has made more history than most--our distinguished President pro tempore, Strom Thurmond. 
Strom Thurmond was born during the Presidential term of Theodore Roosevelt--probably the only other person in the 20th century to have a comparable energy level. 
And in the same way TR launched America on the great adventure of the 20th century, Strom Thurmond has been a real force in building up and guiding America during that century. 
A few of our colleagues may have been friends with Jack Kennedy; but Strom Thurmond is the one who ran against Harry Truman--and came within a hair of denying him the White House. 
He is the only sitting Senator today who actually was on a general election ballot as a Presidential candidate. 
Strom Thurmond has always been a man of the people. 
In 1954, when the 31-member committee that represented the political establishment of South Carolina froze him out of a special election, Strom Thurmond did what no one before or since has done--ran and won as a write-in candidate for the U.S. Senate. 
Strom Thurmond has always been ahead of his time, with his finger on the pulse of history. 
In the middle of the Johnson landslide in 1964, he moved against the tide, from the Democrat to the Republican party. 
With the next election, he became only the second elected Republican Senator from the deep South since Reconstruction. 
By the time the next two sitting Senators changed party affiliation--30 years later--a majority of the Senators and Representatives from across the Nation--and, for the first time since Reconstruction, a majority from the South--were now in Strom Thurmond's adopted party. 
In fact, he is the only Senator to have served as a Democrat in the majority and the minority, and as Republican in the majority and the minority. 
When we look at the New South today, we see the fruits of the `Thurmond Revolution,' or the `Thurmond Realignment.' He showed the way. 
The issue on which I've probably worked most closely with Strom has been the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
When you work with him closely on an issue like that, you see how, and why, his colleagues revere him. 
I cosponsored the first balanced budget amendment that made it to the floor of the U.S. House in 1982. I've been a part of writing every one since. 
But Strom cosponsored an earlier version in the 1950's. Once again, he was ahead of his time. 
When we finally pass that constitutional amendment, and permanently lock in that balanced budget we achieve in 2002, it will be the `Thurmond Amendment.' 
When you ask Strom Thurmond what his secret is for stamina and energy, he may say something about diet, working out, swimming, or loving the work he does for the people of his State. 
But his secret is, he thinks young--always. 
He probably still considers himself the junior Senator from South Carolina--every time he stands with constituents for a picture in front of the portrait of John C. Calhoun just outside this Chamber. 
One year, his campaign camper was the `Strom Trek.' Another year it was the `Thurmon-ator.' 
And he loves to talk with young people. 
He always has time to talk to the pages and visit with our staffers, treating them with respect and warmth, making them feel special. 
He always remembers to ask about our families, and always imparts some of that joy of life to those around him. 
Strom Thurmond has a joy of life, a love of people, and a sense of duty that give him purpose and energy. 
In a world that we fear is becoming too coarse, he is gracious--and reminds us of the way back to civility. 
He is devoted to God and country. 
He is our most senior Senator and the highest-ranking constitutional officer of the Senate. Best of all for us, Strom Thurmond is our friend and teacher.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. I was proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill when it was introduced. I commend Senator Ashcroft, for his leadership as the principal author of the bill, and Chairman Jeffords, for guiding it through the Labor and Human Resources Committee. 
In a word, this bill is about freedom. Mothers, and fathers and their families, need more freedom in the workplace--more flexibility in balancing the demands of work and family. 
What has the Federal Government all too often given them instead? 
Rules and regulations that are rigid, arbitrary, and one-size-fits all. 
Increasingly over the last 60 years, Federal employment law has reflected the paternalistic attitude of a government that thinks it knows more about work-and-family needs than do the families and workers themselves. 
The apologists of the failed regulatory state will argue that freedom is something granted to the people by the Government; and that freedom is a zero-sum game. For instance, you can't give employees more flexibility without creating an entitlement at the expense of the employer. 
They will offer amendments to this bill next week, asking us to impose more legal straitjackets on workers and employers. We should reject those amendments and opt, instead, for freedom for our workers and their families. 
This bill shows how Government, in its zeal to regulate, has failed our families; and how maintaining basic labor standards, while adding a little dose of freedom and flexibility, will create a win-win situation for employees and employers. 
This bill does not create a right or grant an entitlement. It does not take away from a single worker or employer. It simply removes an obvious example of overkill--of the Government acting as the national nanny. It gives back to workers and their families some of the freedom that was taken away when an earlier Congress went too far in regulating the workplace. 
This bill restores employee choice in an area where, for most private sector workers, the Government had taken it away from them. It allows the employee to arrange flexible work schedules to meet important family needs. It allows the employee the choice between one kind of overtime compensation or another. The employee will still receive time-and-a-half compensation for overtime. Only now the employee will have the freedom to negotiate when and how. 
The apologists of the regulatory state want to expand Federal control over the lives of workers and their families: 
They want the Federal Government, increasingly, to become the personnel manager for every workplace, and the collective bargaining agent for every worker. 
They want the Federal Government to decide a family's priorities for taking time off. But what qualifies Washington, DC, to choose a parent-teacher conference, yes; but the school science fair, no? Dentist appointment, yes; but going to the DMV, no? Some kinds of elder care, yes; versus other kinds, no? 
And you have to take a pay cut if you take their Government-approved leave, because the entitlement mandated under the Family and Medical Leave Act is unpaid leave. 
They want Congress to say to employers with 25 to 49 workers: In 1993 we thought you were a small business. In 1993 we said you didn't have the economies for scale to afford federally mandated leave. Now we think you're a big business and we want to run your employees' benefit package. 
Public employees have the freedom and flexibility that this bill would extend to private sector workers. Flextime and comptime have worked for public employees. These arrangements are overwhelmingly popular with the workers who have been eligible for them. 
Now is the time to pull back a little on the long arm of big brother. Now is the time to give back some of the workplace freedom that previous Congresses took away.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from North Dakota who I think said it so well just a few moments ago as it relates to the outcome of the court actions in the Presiding Officer's home State and the city of Denver. 
What it says about our society is so very clear, that we gave and we give and we protect the rights of our citizens to speak openly and freely in protest against their Government, to express themselves and their opinions without fear that somehow the heavy hand of Government might sweep down on them, but if they use violence as an expression, a political expression, that then they fall within the act of a terrorist, and if so proven to be such, the kind of action or the kind of verdict that came about in Denver is the consequence. 
And that of course is what has marked the civility of our country well over 200 years now. And thank goodness our system still proves, as it apparently has expressed its will in Denver this afternoon, that it does work and it does work effectively. 
So I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from North Dakota in making those statements.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to recognize a member of my staff who will be retiring next Friday after many years of service to me, the State of Idaho, the Senate, and the Nation. 
Norman G. Arseneault came to my office as an American Political Science Association fellow from the Forest Service, USDA more than 6 years ago. He served with distinction in that fellowship program, taking on numerous natural resources problems facing the State of Idaho and working diligently to find solutions. When he completed the fellowship, he returned to the Forest Service to resume what I am sure would have been a distinguished career. 
Shortly after he had returned to the Forest Service, it became clear to me that solutions to the natural resources problems we faced--the wilderness debate in my State, endangered species listing, and a host of others--would benefit from Norm's skills. I offered him a permanent staff position, and, fortunately for Idaho, he accepted. 
Since then, all in my office have benefited from Norm Arseneault's professionalism, good humor, and integrity. He has developed a reputation on the Hill and in the State of Idaho for honesty, straightforwardness, fairness, and competence. It has been my good fortune to have been among those who have known and worked with him on a day-to-day basis. 
As Norm moves on to a new phase in his life, I know the traits that have made him so effective in my office over the past 6 years will service him well in his future endeavors. I am proud to know Norm Arseneault and to have called him friend. I speak for all in my office when I say he will be dearly missed. We wish him the best and God speed.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, on Monday, many of us will be about the land, speaking to veterans on Memorial Day. Throughout this Nation's history and throughout the world's history valiant soldiers have struggled, distinguished themselves, advanced their cause, and fallen in battle. Yet a Memorial Day commemorating America's brave heroes was a long time in coming. 
A national memorial occasion was observed for the first time in 1886. It began with the Grand Army of the Republic, the organization of Union Army veterans. They started, on a nationwide scale, what some southern women in several Dixie cities had been doing as a local spring ceremony--remembering the Civil War dead by placing flowers on their graves. 
Since then, all too many generations have confronted the savagery of war and added their own list to the role of the fallen heroes. What began as a memorial to casualties of one war is now our day to honor those from all of our wars. 
In the beginning, Memorial Day was more popularly known as Decoration Day. I grew up, as probably the President did, knowing it as Decoration Day. I remember my folks saying now we have to go to the graves and to the cemetery to honor our dead In our family on Decoration Day. It was observed by decorating the graves with flowers and flags. That tradition is still a strong one and many thousands of Americans will go to the graves of their loved ones and to veterans and veterans' graves and memorials on Monday to recognize our veterans. 
Our emphasis today should be to remember the supreme sacrifice so many made to protect our great Nation and secure the freedoms we enjoy. 
Gen. John A. Logan, the commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, called for the observance of Memorial Day in 1886. Today, his words are still eloquent and meaningful, and it is fitting that we recall them. He said, `Let no ravages of time testify to coming generations that we have forgotten as a people the cost of a free and undivided Republic.' 
On this Memorial Day, 1997, that we are soon to celebrate, let us acknowledge the terrible cost and honor the fallen heroes who paid for it have made, by rededicating ourselves to their cause. Let us concentrate on preserving our Nation and honoring our cherished freedoms by recognizing those who preserve them for us. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Personal Safety and Community Protection Act. 
In recent years, a movement has swept the Nation to enable individuals to carry concealed firearms for their protection. Forty-two of the fifty States have some right-to-carry permit mechanism in place, and they are finding these laws make a significant impact on crime. 
The benefits of right-to-carry laws were verified by a landmark study released late last year. Following a comprehensive analysis of annual FBI crime statistics from all the Nation's counties, over 15 years, the authors concluded: 
[a]llowing citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it appears to produce no increase in accidental death or suicides. If those states who did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992, approximately 1,800 murders and over 3,000 rapes would have been avoided yearly . . . 
The primary author of the study, John R. Lott Jr. of the University of Chicago Law School, has pointed out that the benefits of concealed-carry laws are not limited to those who carry the weapons but extend to their fellow citizens, as well. The drop in crime is not necessarily the result of using firearms in self-defense, but of criminals changing their behavior to avoid coming into direct contact with a person who might have a gun--which in a concealed-carry State could extend to a wide cross-section of the public. 
The legislation I am introducing today builds on the experience of the States. It is designed to protect the rights of citizens no matter where they may travel in the United States, and to enhance the protection of our communities. 
This bill applies to any person holding a valid concealed firearm carrying permit or license issued by a State, and who is not prohibited from carrying a firearm under Federal law. 
In States that issue concealed carry permits, the individual would be able to carry a concealed firearm in accordance with State laws. In States that do not have right-to-carry laws, the bill sets a reasonable, bright-line Federal standard that would permit carrying except in certain designated places, such as police stations; courthouses; public polling places; meetings of State, county, or municipal governing bodies; schools; passenger areas of airports. 
The second part of the bill provides an exemption for certain qualified current and former law enforcement officers, who bear valid written identification of their status, from laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed firearms. The bill does not override any existing training requirements or restrictions on gun ownership or use by current or former law enforcement officers. The individuals covered by this section of the bill have proven records of responsible, lawful gun use in defense of their fellow citizens and communities. 
Again, Mr. President, this portion of the bill takes a practical, experience-based approach to self defense and community protection. 
I'm pleased to note that my bill is a companion to H.R. 339, introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Cliff Stearns and cosponsored by more than 40 Members from nearly half the States. 
I urge all my colleagues to join us in protecting the rights of your constituents and enhancing the protection of your communities by supporting the Personal Safety and Community Protection Act.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my chairman for yielding. 
Mr. President, I join what I hope is a majority of the Senators on this floor in opposing Hatch-Kennedy. I am not going to argue the merits of it one way or the other. I don't think that is the issue this morning. The issue is that a budget deal gets broken--a budget deal that has been woven together in a bipartisan format that gives both sides some recognized need and that produces a budget that is good for the American people. 
All of us are concerned about child health care, or there wouldn't be $16 billion in this budget agreement for children without health care. Therein lies the issue. 
I think it is important to note that, while my colleague from Oregon just talked about an analysis that said States would lose money, it is very likely they would lose money, and that is, in fact, one of the analyses. It could cost them up to $6.5 billion over 5 years. 
Again, it is against the very direction that we want to head in; that is, empowering the States to take care of their own needs instead of handing them a new Federal mandate and a new program from the top down, telling them what to do and how to do it. We do that, in essence, by stealing away from them the very revenue base that they have been using for these purposes. 
This would directly hurt the health and educational programs in 16 States that earmarked part of their tobacco tax for this purpose. 
This doesn't include the cost of the mandate included in the amendment that will be added on. According to the whip's office, there are 30 State mandates in the proposal. 
Therein is a substantial basis for the objection. 
This Congress has in a bipartisan manner expressed its desire and concern about the health needs of the uninsured young people of this country. That is what the debate ought to be about. 
My guess is that this Congress will work its will as the courts will work their will when it comes to the question of tobacco, when it comes to the question of: Should it be limited, and in what form ought it be limited? But let us not break a budget deal. For this is exactly what will happen with this issue. 
So I hope that we will resolve it in staying with our agreement. We think it is a good one and that this one simply disrupts what is an extremely valuable part of the total program. 
If we are moving toward empowering the States and the individuals to care for their own and their citizens, then Hatch-Kennedy goes directly against that thrust and prescribes again another very large, federally controlled, mandated program that is cross-grain or cross-directional to what we have been attempting to do all along. 
So when you look at all of the aspects that are incorporated in this legislation, it is not precedent setting. It is returning to the past. It is stepping backwards into a large, federally 
controlled bureaucracy that in the end probably doesn't produce the kind of health care that our citizens would want or that our citizens would expect of their way of life or their system of government. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to clarify some issues raised today on the Senate floor by a colleague of mine. Specifically, these issues had to do with a paper entitled `Unforeseen Effects of the Much Touted Tobacco Tax' published on May 16, 1997 by the Senate Republican Policy Committee, of which I am chairman. 
My colleague made several statements about the analysis but failed to address the substance of the paper's argument: That the $6.5 billion loss in state revenue over the next five years will hinder states' ability to provide services to their citizens. This loss of revenue will pressure states to accept a new program that includes many mandates and additional costs that will yet further strain their budgets. Finally, this substantial incursion to a state revenue source establishes a dangerous precedent for further such incursions by the federal government. 
It is a principle of the Republican party that the federal government should not place an unfunded mandate on the states, regardless of the reason. If the end is so laudable, then the federal government should provide the means for delivering it. In the last Congress, a proposal to prevent unfunded mandates was given the Republican party's highest priority. Introduced as the first bill in the Senate, S.1, passed (86-10) with all Republicans supporting it, and sent to the President who signed it. 
The program debated today violated that principle by not only leaving states with an unfunded liability, but reducing their revenues for their own priorities. In short, the program being debated not only would increase states' spending but decrease their revenues at the same time. 
The paper put out by the Republican Policy Committee made that clear. The fact that my colleague chose to ignore it and the underlying problem of the program's approach, does not change the program's impact and should not diminish our concern that the states be treated fairly and honestly by the federal government. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing, with the cosponsorship of Senator Kempthorne, the Coeur d'Alene River Basin Environmental Restoration Act of 1997. This legislation would allow for a workable solution to clean up the historic effects of mining on the Coeur d'Alene Basin in North Idaho. This bill is similar to a bill (S. 1614) I introduced in the last Congress. 
This legislation establishes a process that is centered around an action plan developed between the Governor of the State of Idaho and a Citizens Advisory Commission comprised of fourteen representatives of affected State and Federal government agencies, private citizens, the Coeur d'Alene Indian Tribe; and affected industries. The responsibilities of this Commission are very important to the ultimate success of cleaning up the Basin. I would like to note that a Commission that mirrors the one in this legislation was created by the Idaho legislature and that legislation was signed into law by Governor Phil Batt. I am indeed pleased that Idaho has put in place the citizen committee that is the crux of this plan to clean up the Silver Valley. 
The Silver Valley of North Idaho has made contributions to the national economy and to all of our country's war efforts for well over a century. The federal government has been involved in every phase of mineral production over the history of the Valley. It is, therefore, appropriate that Congress specifically legislate a resolution of natural resources damages in the Coeur d'Alene Basin and participate in funding such a plan. 
I want to make clear this legislation does not interfere with the ongoing Superfund cleanup within the 21-square mile Bunker Hill site. This legislation sets up a framework for voluntary cleanup of affected areas outside this 21-square mile area. In drafting this legislation, I have worked with the mining industry, the Coeur d'Alene tribe, local governments, the Governor of Idaho, and citizens in North Idaho. It is only through the involvement of all these parties that a solution will be reached. 
Throughout this effort it has been clear that all parties want the Basin cleaned up, and they want the cleanup done with the concerns of local citizens and entities addressed and with controls and cleanup decisions made in Idaho, not in Washington, DC. These are the guiding principles that I have applied in developing this legislation. 
Local cleanup has already begun in the headwaters of the Basin's drainage. Nine Mile Creek and Canyon Creek have had proven engineering designs implemented within their drainages. The Coeur d'Alene River Basin Environmental Restoration Act of 1997 would assure this type of meaningful restoration could continue. However, the actions needed in each part of the Basin are not clear. That is why my bill calls for the Governor of Idaho and the Citizens Advisory Commission to develop an Action Plan that can address the varying conditions within the Basin. For example, engineering solutions will certainly work in portions of the Basin--but not every place. The steeper gradient streams in the upper Basin respond well to engineering fixes, but these types of fixes may only exacerbate problems in the lower, flatter portions of the Basin. Local input and control through the action plan can address such diversity and the need for varying environmental fixes. 
The Department of Justice is currently pursuing a lawsuit for alleged natural resources damages in the area addressed by this legislation. For the federal government to follow such a course is folly. When the federal government litigates under Superfund, the members of the legal profession benefit, as litigation eats away at whatever resources are available for a cleanup. Litigation does not benefit the citizens affected by a cleanup and certainly does not benefit the resources that are purported to be the primary consideration when such a suit is pursued. I do not intend to see cleanup resources in North Idaho squandered in litigation. It is my goal to see that Coeur d'Alene Basin cleanup is not litigated away. That is the reason we have introduced this legislation. it will clean up the Basin, not litigiously waste the Basin's resources.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I certainly respect the comments of my colleague, and I will leave it at that because at this moment I would like to announce to my fellow Senators a joyous event in my family. 
Yesterday afternoon at 4:46 my daughter, Shae Czartoryski, with the help of her husband Jeff, gave birth to our first grandchild--Suzanne Craig's and Larry Craig's first grandchild --a beautiful baby girl by the name of Riley Anne Czartoryski. She came in at 6 pounds 6 ounces, and 20 1/2 inches long, and yelling her head off. 
We are just tickled pink about that. 
So, as we talk about life and as we talk about joy, I wanted to share with all of you today a joy in my life, my first grandchild, the first grandchild of our family. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the fiscal year 1998 balanced budget resolution. 
I congratulate the hard-working chairman of the Budget Committee for his leadership and dedication in bringing us to this point, as well as our distinguished majority leader. 
Am I especially happy to be able to use those 2 words, `balanced budget.' 
This budget resolution represents a victory for the American people; for sound, conservative principles; for those of us who have fought for years for a balanced budget; for the seniors who will be protected by a safer, sounder Medicare system; and for the workers of today and the children of tomorrow, who will benefit from a healthier economy and better jobs. 
Some may be disappointed because this is not a `perfect' budget; but it's a big improvement over the status quo; and there's a world of difference between this budget and the big-government, tax-and-spend budgets of just a few years ago. 
Less than 2 years ago, President Clinton was saying we didn't even need to balance the budget; then he said, maybe we could balance by 2005; but the new Republican majority elected in 1994, and reelected in 1996, insisted on a plan to a balanced budget by 2002--and now we've got one. 
Two years ago, when the first Republican Congress in 40 years took office, we found a Medicare system ready to go bankrupt in 2001. 
We said it was time to fix Medicare and we tried to slow its rate of growth to 6 or 7 percent a year, with pro-senior citizen, pro-consumer reforms. 
Some from the other side tried to hit us with 30-second attack ads, claiming that seniors' benefits would be slashed and burned. 
But the American people didn't believe them. 
Today, finally, we have a sober, responsible, bipartisan agreement that says Medicare must be repaired--so that Medicare continues to be there for our seniors who need it. 
And yes, in this budget agreement, Medicare grows at about 6 percent a year. 
Under this budget, Medicare part A will be solvent for a decade. 
The details that finally emerge later this year in a budget reconciliation bill will probably not contain all the structural, market-based reforms that Medicare needs for the long term, but this budget should be a good start. 
Four years ago, the President asked for, and Congress unfortunately passed, the biggest tax increase in history. 
Today, this budget agreement includes real, pro-family, pro-growth, tax cuts. 
We finally begin to roll back that last, huge tax increase. 
The skeptics said you couldn't balance the budget, cut taxes, and get bipartisan agreement. 
But this budget will do those things. 
Let's remember: What this budget begins to do is let the people keep more of their own money. 
Under this budget, we will finally begin to get spending growth under control. 
Will the government still be too big and intrusive? Yes. 
But the Federal Government will spend $1.1 trillion less over the next 10 years than it would have spent under previous policies. 
Spending growth will drop from 4.4 percent a year under previous policies to 3.1 percent a year under this budget--just barely more than inflation. 
The Government will finally begin to shrink relative to the size of the economy. 
Spending will still go up in nominal dollars, but it will drop from 20.8 percent to 18.9 percent of gross domestic product, by 2002. 
Of course, a lot depends on the enforcement provisions that will have to be part of the budget reconciliation legislation later this year. 
I'll be watching that legislation closely. 
We've learned from bitter existence in the past that permanent procedures are needed to keep spending from running wild. 
After all, the road to a $5.3 trillion debt was paved with good intentions. 
That's why we should have passed--and still need--a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
But the budget enforcement rules called for under this budget resolution should help keep us on course to a balanced budget by 2002. 
A majority of the people in America have seen the budget balanced exactly once or never in their lifetimes. 
The last two balanced budgets were in 1960 and 1969. 
A majority of Americans alive today were born after 1960. 
It's time for that destructive trend to end. 
It's time to create a better future for all Americans. 
This budget resolution is the right beginning of that promising future.

Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I have the privilege today to be here on the floor to support S. 717, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. 
First of all, I find it important to congratulate Senator Jeffords, Senator Coats, and Senator Lott, who have worked hard to reach a compromise that I believe this legislation supports. It is an important compromise because this is necessary and important legislation. 
As my colleagues have stated so well here today on the floor, IDEA is our Nation's core special education statute for children with disabilities. In 1975, when the original IDEA passed, Congress accepted responsibility in this area. Now it is our turn to live up to this commitment. 
I happen to have a son-in-law who is a fifth grade schoolteacher. He speaks to me about the difficulties in the classroom when there are not enough resources to be able to handle children who find themselves with these difficulties and the average child who is there in the classroom to learn. He finds himself dividing his time up among these, and sometimes in an inappropriate way, and not offering to all of the children the kind of time that their teacher and their instructor ought to give. 
In the bill before the Senate today we have a balanced approach which takes into account the needs and rights of the local school boards, teachers, parents and, most important, the students. Among its chief provisions is the flexibility it affords local school officials in making alternative interim placement of children with disabilities who bring weapons or drugs to school. This was an area of heated debate, and I am pleased to see the final bill includes an arrangement we can all work with. 
Likewise, I am pleased with the progress the committee has made on other controversial issues such as the recovery of attorney's fees and succession of services. While no parties involved will receive all that they hoped for, this balanced approach is fair, and, I think, it is sound public policy. 
There is, however, some work left to be done. Though perhaps not today, this Congress will, in the very near future, have to take up the issue of full funding for IDEA. There is a role for the Federal Government to play in education, and while those of us who believe in the right of the State and, most important, the right of the local school district to have the primary responsibility, the area of funding of targeted needs and special needs has been something the Federal Government has done well over the last good number of years, and IDEA, in my opinion, is one of those. 
When the law was originally passed in 1975, Congress promised to provide appropriations equal to 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for education. Since S. 717 makes progress toward that important goal, I remained committed to seeing us reach the full funding level. I am confident, however, that this issue will be addressed during our consideration of the budget. Accordingly, I do not see the need for amending S. 717 at this time. 
Again, Madam President, I state my thanks for the work that has been done by all of those involved in the lengthy but successful process of bringing S. 717 to the floor. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Byrd amendment and in support of the shutdown prevention provision, the automatic CR in this bill. 
The purpose of this provision is simple: To prevent another government shutdown, in case all 13 appropriations do not become law by October 1. 
Democrat or Republican Congresses, divided or one-party government, the record has been consistent: The 13 regular appropriations bills are almost never all enacted by October 1. 
The shutdown prevention CR would take millions of innocent bystanders out of the line of fire if Congress and the President take longer than expected to finish the budget details this fall. 
It would protect Federal employees, small businesses supplying Government needs, patients in veterans hospitals, their families, and others. 
If the President vetoes this bill over the shutdown prevention provision: 
He is saying his power to shut down the government in October is more important to him than replenishing funds in emergency programs today. 
He is willing to delay putting money back into FEMA and DOD and other essential projects in this bill. 
He is saying he is not concerned whether disaster relief or operations in Bosnia or other functions are threatened by a shutdown this fall. 
Is he already planning to threaten us with a shutdown to get his way on the budget details, as they are negotiated this summer and fall? 
There is only one reason for opposing this provision: To keep alive the threat of shutting down the Government. 
Some Senators oppose this provision because they are afraid it might be used to prevent spending increases in some programs. But, whether they realize it or not, implicit in that argument is the willingness to use the threat of a shutdown to get those increases. 
The shutdown prevention provision does not undermine the budget agreement, it enforces it. 
It gives the President fallback leverage in case the Congress tries to pass spending cuts or new policy provisions he wants to veto. 
It gives the Congress fallback leverage in case the President demands unrealistic spending increases or policy changes. 
Which would do more damage to the spirit of the budget agreement: Temporary, 100 percent continued funding, or a shutdown? 
The shutdown prevention CR will not become a substitute for implementing the budget agreement. 
The automatic CR is not an end result, but a safety net. 
There are still plenty of details, priorities, cuts and increases that all parties in the appropriations process will be motivated to work out. 
There very well may be some disagreements that drag out the process of agreeing on and implementing all the details of the budget agreement. 
This provision simply ensures there will be time to work out all those details, without a government shutdown looming over the negotiations--and over the American people. 
There is no spending cut here. It is incredible: We keep hearing how many dollars will be slashed, how many jobs will not be filled, if we enact the automatic CR provision. How is it that continuing a function at 100 percent of current levels can be called a cut? 
Why must this provision be passed now? 
No matter when this provision is offered, opponents will use some kind of timing or procedural excuse to oppose it. 
Now they say it's too early. This fall they would say it's too late. Now is the best time to enact this provision, because now it is still an objective, neutral safety net, and because this provision will start the appropriations process with all parties on a level playing field. 
The best time to agree on the fair rules of the game is before the game starts. 
There is no way to write a CR provision that would automatically comply with the spending levels in the budget agreement, as the administration suggests. 
There are still thousands of details to be worked out over the coming months, in the normal legislative process, to implement that agreement. 
We do not know today, for a certainty, all the programs that will go up and which will go down in spending in the end. 
But this provision holds all current services and employees harmless until all those details in next year's budget are worked out. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I don't think the Senator from California knows how much I appreciate her speaking boldly and frankly this afternoon about a very real, human problem, which is the inability to do reasonable and responsible maintenance on structures built over the last hundred years in our country to protect life and property. We are not allowed to do it, in many instances, because of the current Endangered Species Act. And I know, as most Senators know, that that was never the intent of the Endangered Species Act. 
Another reason we are here this afternoon is because my colleague, who is now Presiding Officer, Senator Kempthorne of Idaho, has acted boldly over the last 2 years to try to bring about responsible reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. It just hasn't gotten done. The reason is because too many people behind him want to act timidly. It was because of that, because of the effort that the Senator from Idaho had taken because of a crisis situation that existed in the small north Idaho logging community of Saint Maries, where a flood had occurred, a town had been under water, dikes had been destroyed, and now we were in the rebuilding process this last late fall and winter, at a time of unprecedented snowfall in Idaho, with a perched watershed of nearly 200 percent of normal sitting above this community, and in steps the Fish and Wildlife Service and halts the construction of the dikes, as my colleague from Idaho has expressed, and basically said, `We want you to spend a million dollars mitigating.' Those in the community said, `My goodness, can't you see we are at risk here? Can't you see we have just replaced our homes? Can't you see we have just repaired our livelihoods and we have an impending flood and crisis in the making?' The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said, in essence, we don't care, because the Endangered Species Act requires--thank goodness, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works 
Committee and Senator Reid and Senator Kempthorne and I were able to sit down, after I placed this amendment in the supplemental bill, to crank their tail and get some attention, that it was time we acted just a little boldly to solve a problem. 
I must say that my colleagues did come together and they have acted a little boldly--I appreciate that--to amend the Endangered Species Act. I hope we can get that done in the comprehensive legislation that Senator Kempthorne, Senator Chafee, and Senator Reid are working on. It must be done. We want to protect species of plants and animals and insects; but doggone it, we have to protect human life. The hundreds of millions of dollars worth of investment in the California Delta is at risk today, as the Senator from California has so clearly said, and now it will cost hundreds of millions to replace it, when it would have cost hundreds of thousands just to maintain it. That is what we need in Idaho; that's what we need in the Red River Valley in the Dakotas, in California, in Oregon, and in Washington, and any other place in the Nation where flooding can and does occur, where dikes and levees have been built. We need the legislation that is now before us. I am glad we have come to an agreement where that can be resolved. 
Will mitigation occur after the fact? Of course, it will. We want that to happen. Now, I am disappointed that we could not recognize the financing tool that is necessary and very critical to the Senator from California and important to Idaho. But I am also pleased that my colleague from Nevada would recognize our need in north Idaho and agree to help us mitigate the situation in Saint Maries. So what we have now is an amendment to this supplemental appropriations bill for 1996 and 1997 that eliminates this lengthy, unnecessary delay, that makes eligible flood projects respond to mitigation and activities to go forward. Eligible flood control projects are only allowed to perform preventive and remedial measures directly related to the natural disaster and for imminent safety threats. This is the compromise. It is an important one. It resolves the problem for 2 years--last year and this year. And then if we have not been able to effectively address the Endangered Species Act, as we should--and I know my colleague, the Senator from Idaho, wants to accomplish and is working to accomplish this--my guess is that the Senator from California and I will be back. 
We have to solve our problems in Idaho, we have to solve the problems in California, and we have to solve this problem nationwide that man, persons, humans and his or her property come first when an imminent crisis is at hand, where their lives can be destroyed and their property swept away. They deserve the right to be first. Then we will worry about, as we should, any loss of habitat or species that might occur as a result of this natural disaster. 
So I thank all of the parties for coming together to work with us to resolve this problem. Mr. President, it is my understanding that no one else wishes to address this. I believe we may be now ready for a vote.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me first thank my colleague, Senator Kempthorne, for his action and the work in developing this legislation that appropriately recognizes Vernon Baker, Edward A. Carter, Jr., and Charles L. Thomas in what I think can best be called retroactivity, certainly recognizing that there is a special pension tied to the Medal of Honor. 
The Medal of Honor was given to these African American soldiers and citizens and wonderful people in the appropriate fashion, finally, after a long, long wait. We had the opportunity to be at the White House for the ceremonies, and it was truly moving. 
Recognition of their outstanding courage and daring leadership during their service to their country in World War II was far too long coming, as I mentioned. However, their rewards should not be based upon the delay in their recognition, but based on the moment of their heroism. 
In the case of Vernon Baker, one of my fellow Idahoans--as Senator Kempthorne said, we had the privilege of getting to know he and his wife--more than 50 years have passed before the Nation did the appropriate thing in recognizing their courageous actions and bestowing them with the Congressional Medal of Honor. Now fairness demands that we couple this honor with the benefits entitled to them and the next of kin in the case of the deceased, effective to the dates corresponding to their actions. 
Mr. President, on behalf of a grateful Nation, I once more thank Vernon Baker for his gallant actions on that April day so long ago and encourage the support of my colleague's legislation to resolve this issue for America for all time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill of critical importance to our Nation's cattle industry. The joint United States-Canada Commission on Cattle and Beef is designed to resolve some of the existing differences in trade practices between the two countries. 
I want to thank a number of my colleagues who are joining me as original cosponsors of this legislation. The cosponsors of this bill include Senator Baucus, Senator Burns, Senator Gorton, Senator Kempthorne, and Senator Enzi. 
As a former rancher, I have a firsthand understanding of the challenges that face the cattle industry. The prolonged down cycle is especially troubling because it affects the livelihoods of thousands of ranching families in Idaho and across the country. 
These beef producers are the largest sector of Idaho and American agriculture. Over 1 million families raise over 100 million head of beef cattle every year. This contributes over $36 billion to local economies. Even with the extended cycle of low prices, direct cash receipts from the Idaho cattle industry were almost $620 million in 1995. These totals only represent direct sales; they do not capture the multiplier effect that cattle ranches have in their local economies from expenditures on labor, feed, fuel, property taxes, and other inputs. 
Over the years, cattle operations have provided a decent living and good way of life in exchange for long days, hard work, and dedication. While the investment continues to be high, the returns have been low in recent years. 
The problems facing the cattle industry in recent years are complex. The nature of the market dictates that stable consumption combined with increased productivity and growing herd size yield lower prices to producers. This, combined with high feed prices and limited export opportunities, has caused a near crisis. 
Many Idahoans have contacted me on a number of cattle industry issues. Some suggest the Federal Government intervene in the market to help producers. However, many others have expressed fear that Federal intervention, if experience is any indication, will only complicate matters and may also create a number of unintended results. I tend to agree with the latter. Time and again, I have seen lawmakers and bureaucrats in Washington, DC, albeit well intentioned, take a difficult situation and make it worse. This does not mean that I believe Government has no role to play. I have supported and will continue to support Government involvement in areas like trade, where individual producers cannot help themselves. 
This bill recognizes a number of barriers to international trade that adversely affect American beef producers. The bill is meant to elevate the importance of all trade issues and specifically address some of the pending cattle trade issues between the United States and Canada. 
The United States-Canada Commission on Cattle and Beef is a measure designed to provide immediate, short-term solutions to some of the serious trade problems facing the cattle industry. Specific cattle issues that could be resolved with further discussion include animal health requirements and the availability of feed grains. The bill creates 
a commission composed of three people from each country along with a number of other nonvoting advisors. Within 30 days of passage, the Commission must be in place and within 6 months must issue a preliminary report on how to resolve the existing differences between United States and Canadian trade. 
I know that a number of my colleagues have legislation pending in regards to the cattle market. I would comment that I see this bill as a starting point, not an ending point for cattle industry issues and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my colleague on the Appropriations Committee, the Senator from Nevada, was on the floor just a few moments ago to discuss a provision on an amendment that the chairman and other members of the committee helped me place in this supplemental appropriations that really is a critical issue when it comes to dealing with flooded areas and flood victims, and the rebuilding of structures as it relates to floods along many of the rivers of our country. 
What we are finding out in Idaho is that, in certain instances, it is very difficult to rebuild the levy to once again provide that critical barrier between the human species and his or her property and an endangered species, in this instance because agencies simply can't agree. And, as a result, we go into these extended periods of consultation when the flood waters may be rising again, and the dike or the levy simply doesn't get built because there is not the opportunity, vis-a-vis the Endangered Species Act, to act immediately and quickly and responsibly to deal with these issues. We have found that in Idaho. 
I think the folks in North Dakota and the folks along the Ohio are going to be finding that out very quickly now as the flood waters recede and they begin to look at rebuilding along the rivers and making some of the corrections necessary, and doing so in a quick and timely fashion, in this instance potentially preparing for an additional runoff. That has happened in Idaho because we have had early floods in the first week of January. Several of my counties were subject to the 100-year flood. My hometown of Midvale was under 4 feet of water. Those communities and the Federal agencies responded very quickly to build back those levies immediately, and were able to do so in almost all instances. But in St. Mary's, ID, where a flood occurred in 1996 in the winter in February, here we had actual construction of a levy stopped by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service because they said that EPA and the community failed to respond to the Endangered Species Act. 
It is also interesting that in the delta area of California, Senators from California asked the Assistant Secretary of Interior to waive certain provisions so that citizens in that area could respond immediately, and, of course, that was done. The frustration often comes then when the agencies then step in after the fact and require very, very expensive and extremely costly mitigation. For example, in the area of St. Mary's, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is suggesting maybe $100,000 worth of mitigation, maybe 30-plus additional acres of habitat needing to be replaced, even though in all instances there appeared to be adequate habitat in the area. 
My provision in this bill, that the Senator from Nevada speaks of and is attempting to strike, covers only natural disasters and threats to public safety that occurred in 1996 and 1997. It eliminates the lengthy and unnecessary delay to flood control efforts. It is designed to allow Federal agencies and local communities to respond to human safety, to protect human life and to protect private property, and to protect those as the first line of defense in a flood and in the aftermath of a flood. 
Eligible flood control projects are not required to consult prior to emergency efforts. In other words, the Senator from Nevada was referring to a provision that the House committee put in which said that, if it were a declared disaster--what I am suggesting is that, if the water is rising at an unprecedented rate and the local community and the flood control district think they needed to add another foot to the top of the levy, they can do so because it is an impending emergency. Right now it is impossible to do that, if by doing so they might damage habitat, or something that a Federal agency would declare to be a threatened habitat, or I should say a habitat that was threatened--obviously, an endangered species. What we are talking about is the ability to respond quickly. That is why this provision that I am talking about is in the bill. 
My colleague, Senator Kempthorne, has for the last good number of years worked overtime to try to produce a responsive reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. He continues to do that. We are consulting now on adjustments and changes in this provision in the supplemental. My staff has met with John Chafee's staff and Senator Kempthorne's staff to try to work out these differences so that we can have this kind of timely response. It is critically necessary. 
I cannot believe that the Senate of the United States would not say that human life and private property at a time of impending emergency or at the time of the declaration of emergency should not be protected and responded to in a timely fashion, and not to have to worry about an agency coming in afterwards, and saying, `Well, now you are going to have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate.' Communities will respond. They will want to assure that that 
habitat is sound. But, first and foremost, they ought to have the right that they have always had in this country to protect themselves and their property. I don't care. The area in North Dakota ought to have that right. They ought not have to call Washington, DC, and the Fish and Wildlife Service, and say, `What may we do? We have private property and homes to protect, and we are going to ask you to spend 48 hours a week deciding what we may or may not do.' That kind of time does not happen in an emergency environment. 
I would also look at eligible flood control projects and allow them to perform restructuring and operation and maintenance directly related to the natural disasters or an imminent safety threat. That is what we are talking about here. 
I will work, as we have. We spent yesterday and most of today with the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and the subcommittee chairman, Senator Kempthorne, my colleague, to see if we can resolve this issue in the best interests. Certainly, I want to work with the Senator from Nevada on this issue to resolve it. But we are not going to create loopholes, nor are we going to let Federal agencies stand in the way of timely response to the private citizens and their need for protection of their person and their property. That is clearly the intent of the provision that is within the supplemental at this time. I cannot accept changes in that unless they have as their initial premise that very kind of thing. We just do not need to get at the business of a lengthy process here. That comes and always will come at a time when we can approach it much differently than the declared emergency, or the impending emergency that comes with the crisis. 
We have so hamstrung the citizens of our country by laws that simply disallow them the right to protect themselves and to respond in a timely way. It is amazing to me--that very incident, in my opinion, that happened in the north end of my State in the last couple of months, as we knew we were headed into a runoff season of the year when that river and those dikes needed to be completed and, yet, we really saw a ho-hum attitude on the part of the agencies and a shutdown of operations that resulted in the dike not being prepared in a timely way. 
That is the intent. Mr. President, we are working to resolve this issue. I hope we can do so. But for the time being, the language that is in the bill is important language and it meets the need that many in the House wanted, and that, obviously, many in the Senate believe are necessary also. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I certainly join my colleague, the Senator from Pennsylvania, in his expression of concern and hope for the outcome of the volunteer summit that has just occurred in Philadelphia. I, too, hope that we can keep the dynamics of that going. 
There is no question, though, that one of the blights against voluntarism and giving freely of one's time to the benefit of human kind is what has transpired in this country over the last several decades when we have, in fact, denied the doctrine of charitable immunity; in other words, the ability to go out and give of your time and then by chance you make an accident--or by chance somewhere in the process someone might claim some question of injury--that, all of a sudden, you are liable, the courts take it up, the trial lawyers drag you through the courts, and they put a phenomenal blight on the giving concept that voluntarism is all about. 
That is what S. 543 is about--to clearly prescribe what the limits are so that we don't put a legal damper on the kind of 
energies that are spilling forth from Philadelphia that Colin Powell is trying to once again fire up in this country. It is here. It is already here. It is part of the Judeo-Christian ethic that has made up the great growth of this country over the years. 
I want to relate to you a comment that the director of March of Dimes Easter Seals told me right after the Berlin wall came down and Eastern Europe was freeing itself from the shackles of communism that some of it had been under for 70-plus years; most of it for about 45 years. I was with this gentleman one night at a banquet. We were visiting, and we were both seated at the head table. 
I said, `What are you doing nowadays besides the work of Easter Seals and March of Dimes?" 
He said, `You would be fascinated.' He said, `I am spending a lot of time in Eastern Europe with the countries of Eastern Europe.' 
I said, `Doing what?" 
He said, `Teaching them voluntarism.' 
I said, `Tell me more. What do you mean teaching voluntarism?" 
You and I, Mr. President, would have considered that part of our family heritage, part of going to church, part of the extension of the person of the American citizen--voluntarism. What had happened in Eastern Europe and throughout the greater Soviet empire was that government had taken over. Government had become the operative of people. No longer could you give of yourself. It was government that told you what to do, how to do it, what to say, what to think, and all of those kinds of things. Up until that time, I had forgotten, or I guess I had never really concentrated on the root of voluntarism, and what has transpired in our country over the years from the very early days of the barn raising in your State and mine--of neighbors sharing amongst themselves, because there was never enough work force to go around. So I would come over to your farm and help out, and you would come over to my farm and help out. And together, in a sense of community, we would help each other. That was before the days of lots of laws and lots of trial lawyers, and somebody looking around, and, saying `Gee. You have to be liable for that. It is your fault that something happened. And, therefore, we are going to take you to task on that.' 
Voluntarism has always been a phenomenal force in our country. And it did start from a Judeo-Christian ethic of helping one fellow person. That has been and remains the strength of our country. 
I was so pleased when I heard Colin Powell through a series of interviews leading up to the summit in Philadelphia. In fact, I was pleased but a little disappointed one day when Katie Couric in a rather--at least my interpretation--cynical way said, `Well, but, but, but, surely you have to have Government doing some of these things, and, surely, you have to have a Government program. I mean, you have cut welfare, or Congress cut welfare.' And, very consistently, Colin Powell said there is a role for Government. Yes. But there is a very clear role for people. Government doesn't nurture the child in the community. We can put food to the child. But we cannot nurture the soul. That is a personal relationship. That is a giving kind of relationship that is only put forth through the volunteer effort of the caring individual. 
It was the sense of the Soviet States, if they were truly to become free states again and knowing that government could never provide everything to everybody, that they would have to reignite voluntarism in the voluntary spirit of nearly half a century past. So they were asking large contributive voluntary charitable groups from this country to come across, to extend to them how we did it, and to work with them to rekindle the human spirit in an effort of voluntarism. 
That is what Philadelphia is trying to do--not to rekindle because it is clearly here in this country, and it always has been, but to extend it into other areas, urge people to give more of their time, to urge companies to provide time for their employees 
to go out and participate in the community in a free and giving way, and to knock down some of the barriers that exist in normal life that limit people's ability to contribute to give and to volunteer. 
That is what S. 543 is all about--knocking down the percolation of legal barriers that have built up over the years of somebody trying to make somebody liable for something. We know that when you give of your time it is going to put you at risk. You are willing to give less. You back away, and say, `I can't be a part of contributive or voluntary effort if I might be sued.' I mean that isn't in the spirit of Americanism. That isn't in the spirit of the raising of the barn in Kansas a century ago. Sure, the wall might have fallen down, and you had to pick it back up and somebody might have been hurt. There was always that risk. But it was always understood that nobody was liable under those circumstances--that you weren't trying to profit from it personally, that you weren't trying to gain from it. You were giving. 
That is what this legislation is all about--to recreate at least an understanding that people can give of their time freely without a loss of the immunity they have always had with charitable voluntary efforts. 
So I am truly complimentary of the Senator from Georgia for the tremendous effort that he has put behind this. It has come at a very important time. I must say to my colleagues across the aisle. You are filibustering. Get with it. Don't do that. There may be other reasons. But, if it is for this, it is a bad reason. If the trial lawyers of this country are wanting to play games with this, it is the wrong reason. They ought to go somewhere else instead of trying to go at the voluntary spirit of this country, the energy that built our country that made us what we are. It was not Government. It was people giving freely of themselves to other people. 
That is what this legislation is about. That is what the nations of the former Soviet Union have had to actually seek from us. Yes. They want our institutions of government because they figure that ours is the best form of government. But they want our people institution. They know that they cannot have government alone, that it will not serve the needs of citizens of Poland, or Czechoslovakia, or one of those nations that was barricaded and imprisoned behind the Iron Curtain. 
So they reached out to our great charitable voluntary contributive organizations immediately after the fall of the wall, and said, `Come. Teach us again how you make it work because what we see in America, what we see as the great energy and the spirit of your country, is the blend of government with the blend of the free citizen, both working together for the betterment of humanity and for the betterment of your country.' 
That is what S. 543 is all about. It isn't about trial lawyers taking people to court. There is plenty of that to go on in the private sector, and in the private economy, but not in the private giving should that be allowed. I am thankful that S. 543 speaks so clearly of that. 
I again say to my colleagues on the other side: Get with it. Come on. Stop this filibuster. This is a time to stand together, as former Republican Presidents and former Democratic Presidents and a Democrat President stood together in Philadelphia and said this is Americanism at its best. We should not use Government to tear down voluntarism. We should not use laws to restrict it. Let us use our energies to multiply it for the betterment of our citizens and for mankind. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. I came to the floor to speak to that piece of legislation, but also to speak to the supplemental and the current situation the Senate finds itself in at this moment. 
Senator Dorgan has spoken passionately, as he should, about a concern for the citizens of his State and that their needs are responded to because of the devastating floods that are ongoing in his State. For that, this Senate will respond. 
I now have the privilege of serving on the Appropriations Committee, and I must tell you that it is my intent to support a supplemental appropriation that has disaster relief in it--for the citizens of North Dakota, yes, but also for the citizens of Midvale, ID, my hometown. 
In early January of this year, the national television cameras did not sweep across the 4 feet of water that surged through my hometown, that displaced 40 residents, destroyed homes, took the one small general store and put it out of business. I flew over it a few days later in a helicopter to see utter devastation like I had never seen before and like my friends and neighbors had never witnessed. I remembered looking at the files of the local newspaper and the flood of 1950 when I was a small child in that community. This, of course, was even worse. This was, without doubt, the 100-year flood. 
Now, what I found out at that time--and I have great praise for FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers and others--is that they did respond and they responded immediately. The citizens of Midvale were cared for within the limitations of the law and prescriptive to their needs. I am pleased about that and played a small role in helping them. 
What I also find out is that the citizens of North Dakota are being cared for at this moment. There is adequate money at this moment to deal with the immediate needs. They are being cared for. Will there be necessary moneys for the future needs of rebuilding and repair? No. That is what the supplemental is all about. There is adequate time for a responsible and reasoned debate on what we do about the expenditures of our Government. 
I am going to support a continuing resolution tied to the supplemental appropriation. Why? Because I do not like the budget process gamed. I do not like a President, who owns a bully pulpit, to veto and then stand on that pulpit, when it was his pen that brought the Government to a halt, turning and saying, `Look at those folks up on the Hill. They did not give me what I wanted, so I am shutting the Government down.' He says, `They did not give me what I wanted, so they are shutting the Government down,' and he got away with it. The American people said, `Oh my goodness, isn't that terrible. Congress should not have done that.' 
Congress did not intend to do that. Congress will not do that again. That is why we have considered amongst ourselves the importance of putting together a supplemental with a continuing resolution that has a level of expenditure of 98 percent of the 1997 fiscal year level. That is right and it is responsible. 
Now, I am on the Appropriations Committee. Yes, I am a freshman. I understand that. Does it take away my power and my leverage on the committee? I really do not think so. All appropriators want to produce and pass the 13 appropriations bills that will constitute the new budget for fiscal year 1998. Why? Because it is good policy. The President has some new programs, and he will get them. We have some new programs that we want and some spending reduction levels that we want and a tax package that we want that we think are important for the American people, and we will get there and the budget will be balanced. 
But what the CR gives us is the room to operate and to say to our Government employees, you will not be put at risk and we will not allow you to be gamed. I have a sense there is a little gaming going on now about the need and the urgency. 
Let me make myself clear. It is my understanding, based on an immediate review of the budgets of FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers and other areas, that they have money to deal with the immediate situation, and it has been dealt with. Every citizen in this country that turned on the national news saw Federal employees and Federal people on the ground in North Dakota helping, and they are there today and will be there tomorrow. What is important is that we deal with this issue and deal with it in a responsible and timely way. Will there be add-ons to the supplemental? Yes, there will be.

Mr. CRAIG. The President, as the Commander in Chief, has the latitude within the law to spend beyond the limits of the budget when we have troops in foreign lands. The Food and Foraging Act allows for the President to do that. That case has occurred in Bosnia. What the supplemental offers is some reprogramming of dollars within the defense budget to pay for expenditures that have already been let in the area of Defense. So it is not just flood money. It is clearly reprogramming money for the Department of Defense and for our troops stationed in Bosnia.

Mr. CRAIG. Well, I agree with that, of course. As you know, our budgets operate on a fiscal year basis. My guess is that, come October 1, 1997, when the 1998 budget begins, there will be Federal agencies on the ground in North Dakota negotiating contracts with private contractors to rebuild or restore facilities in those devastated areas. They will be, at that moment, negotiating. If the Government shuts down for any given time, all negotiations have to stop, all transactions have to stop. That is reality. The Government isn't functioning. 
As we found out in the last shutdown, it is a very clear shutdown--cease and desist, turn out the lights, go home--except for only essential employees who, by definition of their employment, might stay on location for the security of the buildings and operations of the facilities. That is reality. 
So I think the point the Senator from Georgia makes is a very clear and important point. Now, with these disasters ongoing and impending, the reality of continuation is very, very important. I have money in this supplemental for Idaho. It could be called disaster money. It goes to my hometown of Midvale and Washington County and Payette County and Jerome County. I have 13 counties in Idaho that have been declared disasters. We have flooding going on in my State as we speak. 
Senator Dorgan mentioned he didn't want any add-ons. Let me tell you of an amendment I am going to try to put on. It deals directly with disaster, and it is an add-on. When a disaster strikes and there is an immediate event and an emergency situation and there needs to be build-back of dikes to protect private property and private life, we have a problem. The problem is that the Endangered Species Act can step in, and external agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services and National Marine Fisheries can oftentimes come in like they have 
in California during the incidents in January of this year. There was a special area designated by the Assistant Secretary to allow the waivers to take place because it had to be an Executive waiver. In St. Marys in north Idaho, a flood event that occurred in 1996 was in the midst of being repaired. At that time, there were over 400 homes in that community under water. As I flew over in a helicopter, just the rooftops were sticking out. The dikes had blown. Now they are repairing them. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stepped in and said, `We don't think you are following the Endangered Species Act. Stop.' That order went out about a month and a half ago. There is no more dike building going on in St. Marys in Benewah County in north Idaho. The water is rising as we speak and the dike is not complete. This is all about habitat for osprey eagles and has nothing to do with human life and property. 
My little amendment says that during the time of a declared emergency--in this instance, I am simply saying 1996 and 1997--the Endangered Species Act doesn't pertain during the time of emergency and emergency repairs to follow. I am sure that that will be the case along the Red River in North Dakota and other areas that we will have to deal with. That is an add-on, and I am sure the Senator from North Dakota would want that. There can be others that can be argued to be direct and specific as it relates to the supplemental. 
Mr. President, I came to the floor to suggest that this Senate deserves to debate and to vote upon S. 543. I find it amazing that, in this system of Government by laws that we all support and believe in, we have found ourselves so encumbered by laws that we can no longer volunteer, or you can't give freely of your time without liability or without risk of liability, or to work in a voluntary organization, and that organization has to take out insurance to protect themselves so that they are exempt from lawsuit. We used to deal with that as a free and open society. We had a doctrine of charitable immunity. In other words, we said, if you are giving to charity and you are giving in a voluntary and charitable way, you are immune from litigation. Well, that no longer exists. Most States abrogated charitable immunity by imposing full liability for damages without adequate consideration of whether unique characteristics of charitable organizations and volunteers warranted some other arrangement. 
I find it amazing that we are being blocked by the party of the President, who has just done a very admirable thing in Philadelphia about voluntarism, to launch a national voluntarism program across this country, which I suspect 100 percent of the Senate believes in, along with the huge majority of the American people. We are now at a standstill on legislation to protect those who would come out in response to our President and to General Powell and to past Presidents and to a nation which really does believe that the way to save our cities of America is not just a Federal program, but to incorporate the cause and caring of citizens of our country that give of their time in a voluntary way. 
I hope that we can pass this legislation. It is literally being filibustered at this moment. Are there extenuating circumstances? Yes, there are. We all know that. It is too bad we can't move on with this legislation and deal with it. But I will tell the Senator this. I mentioned it to him several times on the floor in, I think, appropriate and just ways. We will convene the Appropriations Committee this afternoon, we will mark up a supplemental, and it will have some emergency dollars in it and some defense reprogramming. It will have a CR in it, I believe, and it will probably have other issues in it that Senators, bipartisan Senators, Democrats and Republicans, will find necessary to put in the supplemental. 
I yield to the Senator.

Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for saying so. I said it in the context that it is an add-on. You are right. I think it is appropriate and I think it will have bipartisan support. We are all for the Endangered Species Act, and we want to make sure our Government agencies function and operate in a way that their activities do not damage or threaten endangered species. But in a time of a flood incident or emergency, to invoke a bureaucracy and withhold the ability to immediately get out there and solve that problem and protect private property and human life is really beyond me. Yet, we find ourselves in that circumstance. My amendment will deal with that. 
With those comments, I hope we can move in a timely fashion to deal with S. 543. I hope that, with the work of the 
Appropriations Committee this afternoon, we can have a supplemental come to the floor that deals with disaster relief, that deals with reprogramming of defense dollars. It is going to deal with a lot of other issues. It is not the disaster bill. It should not be said that it is. It is an appropriation bill dealing with supplemental needs, most of them requested by the President and sent to the Congress. We are responding to the administration, in most instances, by dealing with those things that the President feels are necessary and that the majority of the Congress would agree with. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for bringing this special order to the floor and to the attention of our colleagues. 
For those who are watching this morning, yesterday, the Medicare trustees issued a report that was no surprise but, clearly, once again, reaffirmed to the administration and to the Congress of the United States that there is no good news when it comes to the strength and stability of the Medicare trust funds. What we had hoped for was just news. Knowing that it wasn't going to be good, the question was how bad was the bad news going to be? 
Two years ago, the trustees forecasted that the Nation's Medicare Program would be bankrupt, out of money, by the year 2002. Just last year, the trustees revised that prediction, saying bankruptcy would come sooner, in the year 2001. CBO has also predicted that the trustee fund would be broke by 2001, that it would run a deficit. It is now running a deficit. It did for the first time this past year, and it will run a $10 billion deficit this year. In other words, more money is being pulled from the trust fund than is now flowing into the trust fund to make it safe and secure. 
So let's face it. Our Medicare system is in critical condition, and it deserves to be treated as a patient with an illness. In this instance, we--the Congress of the United States and the President--are the doctor. Or, another way to say it, Madam President, is we sit on the board. We are the board of trustees, and the President is the chairman of the board. 
It is our responsibility to fix the problems that are now very, very clear, and which have been repeated for 5 years in a row by the trustees of Medicare. Two-thirds of these trustees are appointed by the President--this President. It is their job to report to him, as they did yesterday, and to the Congress on the health of Medicare. And they have reported that the health is not good at all. So, for 5 years running, not only have we received these reports, but the administration has received the identical reports. 
Last year, recognizing that, we dealt with it. We looked at a 30-year-old health insurance program that provides health insurance coverage for 35 million Americans and said, in that 30-year history, it really hasn't had major overhaul or reform to fit modern health care needs and to fit modern seniors; therefore, we ought to do something about it. And we did. 
That reform went in the balanced budget down to the White House, and the President vetoed it. For a year after that we saw television ad after television ad saying that the Congress of the United States had been irresponsible, that somehow they were trying to destroy Medicare as we know it for the stability and the security of our seniors when, in fact, we had offered a variety of modern options that would not only provide seniors with adequate health care and health care coverage but would address the deficit that, once again yesterday the trustees, appointed by this President, said, `Mr. President, Congress, we report to you that this sick patient called `Medicare' is growing sicker by the day and that it is still a 2001 bankruptcy, but it is not going to be late in 2001 now. It is going to be early in 2001.' 
My guess is, if we do nothing this year, the trustees will come back next year and say, `Well, it is not going to be early 2001 now. It is going to be late 2000.' 
What is the point of our discussion here today? The point is that we are prepared, as a Congress of the United States, to work with this President to reform Medicare, to save it, to secure it, to strengthen it, and to modernize it for the senior citizens of this country. 
I mentioned 35 million Americans being covered. By the year 2001, it is going to be 38 million Americans. So there is always a growing and greater dependency on this program. It clearly is our responsibility to address it, and to address it in the right and appropriate fashion. That is a bipartisan approach. That is the President and the Congress of the United States sitting at the same table. That is not one party trying to lead over another. I am sorry, the House and the minority leader of the House, it is not a political game anymore. You are not going to get any more mileage by demagoging or by pulling the programs out and sticking them under the general fund and allowing them to increase beyond the rate of private health care in this country. 
It is time that we must come together as a group--the board of trustees, those responsible for the strength and security of Medicare--and address it in the appropriate fashion.

Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I want to address one other issue briefly. It is going to become one that all of us will be increasingly involved in as this month plays out and as the House works on it. The Senate will soon deal with the supplemental appropriations. 
My colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, has just entered the Chamber. She, I, and the leader all have recognized the importance of this supplemental appropriations. But we also recognize the importance of avoiding the kind of budget battles in the future that allowed the shutdown of Government a couple of years ago. 
So the Senator from Texas has introduced what I call--and I believe she calls--a `safety net' funding mechanism for 1998 that will disallow Government shutdowns. We call it a `continuing resolution.' We simply say the budget process goes on and the appropriating process goes on, and, while we work out our differences with this administration, let us pass a continuing resolution that is 98 percent of 1997 levels so that we continue to gain our savings toward a balanced budget, but we can turn rationally to the Government itself and say, `We are not going to hold you out as hostage. It is important that we work cooperatively together.' 
I hope that we will continue to look at this. It is time that we deal with it directly. The bill is clearly about politics as usual, and it would change the whole dynamics of the debate. It would allow us to work in a timely and appropriate fashion on the necessary appropriations bills. Twenty-seven days of Government shutdown in December 1995 and January 1996 furloughed over 800,000 Federal employees. There was a lot of political posturing. But in the end nobody gained, and a good number of people got hurt. The Congress of the United States and the President weren't doing what they should have done. 
The Government Shutdown Prevention Act as a continuing resolution coupled with the supplemental will build that very kind of safety net so we can go ahead to continue to work together in a bipartisan manner as we work to resolve our budget differences, strike a budget that is balanced by the year 2002, and deal with the Medicare crisis impending by the reports of the trustees of just this past day. 
These are important issues that the Senate of the United States and this President must come together on. I hope we can do that in the next month, especially on supplementals. But I also hope the President recognizes that Medicare really doesn't deserve to be tinkered with nor nibbled around the edges anymore as a way of solving the problem. 
We don't need a 1-year or a 2-year fix. We really need a long-term reform approach that strengthens, maintains, and offers a variety of options for the seniors of our country so they can have the understanding that this Congress has dealt with their concerns in a way that should not alarm but assures them a strong and a safe program. 
I thank my colleague from Wyoming for establishing this special order. And I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, thank you and let me thank my chairman, not only for yielding but for his leadership on this most important issue that now is being thoughtfully and responsibly debated here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
Madam President, the Chemical Weapons Convention has such far-reaching domestic and national security implications that it deserves the most thorough and thoughtful examination the Senate can give it. I have given this matter a careful review and would like to reiterate some of the conclusions I have reached. 
If I thought supporting this treaty would make chemical weapons disappear, and give us all greater security from these heinous weapons, I would not hesitate in giving my support. Unfortunately, the facts do not demonstrate this; indeed, implementing this treaty may actually increase danger to U.S. citizens and troops. 
The convention has been signed by 160 nations and ratified by only 74--less than 50 percent. Five countries who are thought to have chemical weapons are not even signatories of the convention: Egypt, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, and Syria. Another six nations have signed, but not ratified the convention: China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Israel, and Russia. In short, this convention is not global in scale. 
Even if it were true that this treaty had been signed and ratified by 160 nations, serious problems would remain. Compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention cannot be assured because it is not effectively verifiable. 
I think it is timely and appropriate to remember, as others have mentioned, the principles of Ronald Reagan. Even though he started the process that we are debating today, he would have insisted in the end, while we might trust our allies and our friends around the world, that in every circumstance we must verify. 
Unlike nuclear weapons which require a large, specialized industrial base, chemical weapons can be manufactured almost anywhere. Furthermore, many lethal chemicals are common and have peaceful uses. Chemicals help us to manufacture products such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, plastics, and paints. With such a broad spectrum of uses, it would be difficult to discern the legitimate from the illicit. 
It is also very disturbing to me that ratification of this treaty would abandon a fundamental arms control principle insisted upon over the last 17 years--that the United States must be able to effectively verify compliance with the terms of the treaty. Verification has meant that U.S. intelligence is able to detect a breach in an arms control agreement in time to respond appropriately and assure preservation of our national security interests. I believe the Senate has an obligation to uphold this sound standard. Let me take this opportunity to express my support for Senator Helms' condition in this regard. I applaud his effort to make real verification a condition of CWC implementing legislation, if the treaty is ratified. 
Even if verification of compliance were not a concern, this convention would be difficult to enforce. In a sound arms control treaty, the United States must be able to punish other countries caught in violation of the agreement. The Chemical Weapons Convention provides only vague, unspecified sanctions to be imposed on a country found in breach of the Convention. Ultimately, the Chemical Weapons convention leaves the U.N. Security Council to impose penalties severe enough to change behavior of an outlaw nation. Since any one of the five members of the Security Council can veto any enforcement resolution lodged against them or their friends, China and Russia, for example, could simply veto resolutions imposing sanctions if they disagreed with other Security Council members. In sum, it does not appear that this agreement is verifiable or enforceable. 
Even if the enforcement mechanism to punish violators of the treaty were perfect, countries that represent the greatest threat to United States security such as Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and North Korea have not ratified the treaty and would be under no obligation to comply with its terms and conditions. Furthermore, our intelligence experts tell us that each one of these countries has 
active and aggressive programs to develop and produce chemical weapons. 
Iran has a stockpile of blister, choking, and blood agents possibly exceeding 2,000 tons. Their program is the largest in the Third World. Syria, which has been increasing production of chemical weapons since the 1980's, is home to several radical terrorist organizations, including Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Many worry that Syria could easily supply these organizations with chemical weapons. North Korea has a stockpile of nerve gas, blood agents, and mustard gas. Additionally, North Korea has the ability to unleash large scale chemical attacks through mortars, artillery, multiple rocket launchers, and Scud missiles. Currently, Libya has one chemical weapons production facility in operation, and a larger plant under construction. Iraq has not only a substantial capability, but has demonstrated a willingness to use these weapons against their own people. 
It has been observed that under the CWC, members to the convention would face no difficulty looking for prohibited chemicals in free and open countries which will accurately declare the location of chemical facilities. However, this situation will be much different for rogue states that are a party to the convention. As arms control verification experts correctly point out, `We've never found anything that's been successfully hidden.' Let me repeat that: `We've never found anything that's been successfully hidden.' Will the unintended consequence of the CWC be that villainous states will be more secure, and peaceful states less? 
Furthermore, have all questions raised in regards to the convention's compatibility with our constitution been sufficiently addressed? The Convention creates an international monitoring regime called the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW. The OPCW will be granted the most extensive monitoring power of any arms control treaty ever because it extends 
coverage to governmental and civilian facilities. 
The authority of this international monitoring regime also raises concern about foreign nationals having such broad authority to obtain access to property held by private U.S. citizens. The U.S. chemical industry is known to be one of the top industries targeted for espionage by foreign companies and governments. There is legitimate worry that international inspections could jeopardize confidential business information, trade secrets, and other proprietary data. Since the United States will be expected to pay 25 percent, or approximately $50 million, of the OPCW's operating costs, American tax dollars could be subsidizing increased risk for U.S. business interests. 
There is also an implementation cost that will be borne by private industry. The cost for each inspection has been estimated as high as $500,000 for large chemical companies, and a range of $10,000 to $20,000 for small companies. Costs could become even higher if a shutdown is required for an inspection to safeguard proprietary information or company security. 
Another issue which has not been thoroughly discussed is how the costs incurred with the inspections are to be paid. Estimates of the number of companies to be inspected in America vary from 140 firms to over 10,000 firms. 
And even though we would pay the lion's share of the international monitoring regime's budget, the United States would have no special status over other signatory nations, no veto power, and no assurance of being a member of the executive council. 
In conclusion, making the production and possession of chemical weapons illegal according to international law will not make them disappear. Use of such weapons has been prohibited since 1925 yet we have seen the results of their use. We all know about the tens of thousands of deaths from poison gas in World War I, and no one could forget the tragic photographs of 
the Iranian children killed during the 1980's by the Iraqi government. Illegal? Yes, but still in use, nonetheless. 
I stand today with all Americans expressing a grave concern over the increasing proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. The real question here seems to be whether ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention will increase our own national security. Unfortunately, the answer is no. There is little value in implementing international laws which do little to decrease illegal research, development, and proliferation of chemical weapons worldwide. 
I support the goal of making the world safe from the threat of chemical weapons. I applaud the honorable statement the CWC makes against these heinous weapons. However, I believe the best way to protect ourselves from this threat is by rejecting this treaty. The convention does nothing to better our security, but may even open the door to increasing risks against our vital security interests and infringing on the rights of innocent citizens. For these reason, I am compelled to vote against the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Mr. CRAIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding me time. I think it is very important that what I said be what I said. Let me reiterate that it would be impossible to verify with rogue nations. We know in this country we will verify. Our chemical companies will be an open door. We have always played by the rules of the treaties we have signed and we have never intentionally or purposely violated them. That is not the point I was trying to make, and I think the Senator knows that. 
But, what we do know is that for countries who choose not to play by international rules--and there are a good many out there--it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the international monitoring team to be able to verify compliance. I think that is the point. I have not even discussed, nor did I bring up the point of concern, that we would be releasing information. I am also concerned about espionage. And I did express that. So, it is important that that part of it be understood. Our chemical companies, by this treaty, would be an open door. 
Let me also say I do not believe there is a chemical company in this country that is an expert in international affairs. Nor do I want the executives of these chemical companies negotiating a treaty. Nor do I want them establishing the foreign policy of this 
country. I believe that is the job of the Senator, and it is mine, and the job of this body, and of the President of the United States. 
I'm sorry, no matter what the chemical industry says, frankly, I don't care. What I do care about is the security of this country. What I do care about is our national sovereignty. And what I do care about is the issue of verification. I think this treaty simply does not get us where we need to get for a safer world. 
I must say, I am tremendously proud and I have supported this country's disarming itself of chemical and biological weapons. I encourage us to do that. We have done it and we ought to continue to do it and we ought to make sure that our troops in the field have adequate equipment to be able to protect themselves. 
We must lead by example, but let's not walk into or create the illusionary track that I think the CWC simply offers to the world, and most assuredly to this country.

It is very important that it not be suggested that all who are in favor makes it so lopsided that there is nobody in opposition. May I quote Donald Rumsfeld or James Schlesinger or, most important, Edward O'Malley, who was the Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, chief of counterintelligence under Ronald Reagan. He speaks of many companies' great concerns about both economic and secret espionage and expresses his opposition to it.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my point is simply this. There are reasonable people on both sides of this issue who differ and are very loud about the concerns they have. The chemical industry is not monolithic at all when it comes to support for this. There are a substantial number within it who are extremely concerned that they may expose their companies to tremendous economic risk and to the liability of the loss of their secrets that relate to the formulas for the production of peaceful goods and services to our country. I think it is important that that be said at this time and that the names and quotes of these ladies and gentlemen become a part of the Record. 
I yield back any time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention has such far-reaching domestic and national security implications that it deserves the most thorough and thoughtful examination by the Senate. I have given this matter a careful review and now rise to discuss some of the conclusions I have reached. 
If I thought supporting this treaty would make chemical weapons disappear, and give us all greater security from these heinous weapons, I would not hesitate in giving my support. Unfortunately, the facts do not demonstrate this; indeed, implementing this treaty may actually create opportunities for security breaches. 
The Convention has been signed by 160 nations and ratified by only 70--less than 50 percent. Five countries who are thought to have chemical weapons are not even signatories of the Convention: Egypt, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, and Syria. Another six nations have signed, but not ratified the Convention: China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Israel, and Russia. In short, this Convention is not global in scale. 
Mr. President, even if it were true that this treaty had been signed and ratified by 160 nations, serious problems would remain. Compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention is not verifiable. I think it is timely and appropriate to remember the principle President Reagan insisted upon when negotiating an arms control treaty--trust, but verify. Unlike nuclear weapons which require a large, specialized industrial base, chemical weapons can be manufactured almost anywhere. Moreover, many lethal chemicals are common and have peaceful uses. Chemicals help us to manufacture products such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, plastics, and paints. With such a broad spectrum of uses, it would be difficult to discern the legitimate from the illicit. 
Even if verification of compliance were not a concern, this treaty would be difficult to enforce. In a sound arms control treaty, the United States must be able to punish other countries caught in violation of the agreement. The Chemical Weapons Convention provides only vague, unspecified sanctions to be imposed on a country found in breach of the Convention. Ultimately, the Chemical Weapons Convention leaves the U.N. Security Council to impose penalties severe enough to change behavior out an outlaw nation. Since any one of the five members of the Security Council can veto any enforcement resolution lodged against them or their friends, China and Russia, for example, could simply veto resolutions imposing sanctions if they disagreed with other Security Council members. In sum, Mr. President, it does not appear that this agreement is verifiable or enforceable. 
Appropriate questions have also been raised about the treaty's compatibility with our Constitution. The Convention creates an international monitoring regime called the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW. The OPCW will be granted the most extensive and intrusive monitoring power of any arms control treaty ever because it extends coverage to governmental and civilian facilities. 
The intrusive nature of this treaty brings up important issues in regards to our citizens' constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure of private property. Mr. John Yoo, an acting professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley wrote yesterday in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that `Under the CWC, a drug dealer running a crack house will have more constitutional rights than the law-abiding operator of a chemical plant.' Proponents of the Chemical Weapons Convention have suggested that there are a wide variety of solutions to the constitutional problem. However, the Chemical 
Weapons Convention states that it is `unlawful to disrupt, delay, impede an inspection or refuse entry of an inspection team.' It appears as though this treaty is incompatible with our Constitution. 
Furthermore, Mr. President, I do not want to look for ways to get around the so-called constitutional problem. If the treaty flies in the face of rights protected under the fourth and fifth amendments, we cannot and should not ratify. 
The authority of the international monitoring regime also raises concern about foreign nationals having such broad authority to obtain access to property held by private U.S. citizens. The U.S. chemical industry is known to be one of the top industries targeted for espionage by foreign companies and governments. There is legitimate worry that international inspections could jeopardize confidential business information, trade secrets, and other proprietary data. Since the United States will be expected to pay 25 percent, or approximately $50 million, of the OPCW's operating costs, American tax dollars could be subsidizing increased risk for U.S. business interests. And even though we would pay the lion's share of the OPCW's budget, the United States would have no special status over other signatory nations, no veto power, and no assurance of being a member of the executive council. 
Despite my objections to ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, I believe Senator Kyl's Chemical and Biological Threat Reduction Act will help protect our citizens and troops from the threat of chemical and biological weapons. This bill would establish workable national policies for confronting the chemical and biological weapons threats, while not jeopardizing our national security like the CWC. 
Currently, there exists no U.S. law providing comprehensive criminal, civil, and other penalties for the acquisition, possession, transfer, or use of chemical or biological weapons. Senator Kyl's bill would impose stiff criminal and civil penalties for illegal possession of chemical weapons. The death penalty could be a punishment for an individual who causes the death of another through this bill. 
The Chemical and Biological Threat Reduction Act also imposes mandatory sanctions against nations that use biological and chemical weapons against other countries or their own citizens. Unlike the Chemical Weapons Convention that only vaguely defines sanctions which could be thwarted by the U.N. Security Council, this bill would automatically terminate foreign assistance, suspend arms sales, impose import and export restrictions, and end financial assistance from multilateral banks. This act also would improve the readiness of U.S. military forces against chemical weapons attacks by improving troop preparedness. 
In view of some of the contacts I've had from Idahoans concerning Senator Kyl's bill, I think it's important to point out that this bill does not ratify the flawed Chemical Weapons Convention. It would enhance our own methods to deal with chemical terrorism without making us vulnerable to the defects of the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Mr. President, making the production and possession of chemical weapons illegal according to international law will not make them disappear. Use of such weapons has been prohibited since 1907, yet we have seen the results of their use. We all know about the tens of thousands of deaths from poison gas in World War I, and no one could forget the tragic photographs of the Iranian children killed during the 1980's by the Iraqi Government. Illegal? Yes, but still in use, nonetheless. 
Mr. President, I stand today with all Americans expressing a grave concern over the increasing proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. The real question here seems to be whether ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention will increase our own national security. Unfortunately, the answer is no. There is little value in implementing international laws which do little to decrease illegal research, development, and proliferation of chemical weapons worldwide. 
I support the goal of making the world safe from the threat of chemical weapons. I applaud the honorable statement the CWC makes against these heinous weapons. However, I believe the best way to protect ourselves from this threat is by rejecting this treaty. The Convention does nothing to better our security, but may even open the door to increasing risks against our vital security interests and infringing on the rights of innocent citizens. For these reason, I am compelled to vote against the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from South Dakota today as an original cosponsor of the Imported Meat Labeling Act of 1997. This act would require the labeling of imported meat and meat products prior to their sale at a retail level in the United States. 
For the record, I want my colleagues to know that this type of action is legal under the terms of our GATT Agreement. In addition, a number of groups have policy that support this type of measure including the American Farm Bureau, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and the American Sheep Industry. 
Again, I commend Senator Johnson for introducing the Imported Meat Labeling Act of 1997 and Senator Burns from Montana for his additional efforts on this topic. I hope that other Senators will join us in support of this measure. I would pledge my support of addressing any legitimate concerns that this legislation might raise and ask in return that we seek quick resolution and passage of this bill. 
One legitimate concern with this legislation is the treatment of Canadian cattle that are slaughtered in the United States. Concern along the northern tier States that border Canada is high among all areas of Canadian trade. Producers in these States might ask how cattle that are born in Canada, fed in Canada, but shipped to the United States for slaughter would be labeled. Realistically, these animals are Canadian and the beef produced from them should be labeled as such. However, if the legal interpretation is different, I state my willingness for the record to amend this legislation and address this type of concern.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Georgia for the time he has taken today to bring this critical issue to the floor and for an open discussion among Senators and, hopefully, the American people on a proposed Executive order that our President is at least talking about at this moment, and that the Vice President has pledged that the administration will act upon, which would significantly change the dynamics of Federal contracting. 
Without doubt, open competition in a free enterprise environment is the only way the Government of this country and the taxpayers can expect fair treatment of the tax dollar when it comes to buying the goods of Government or the projects of Government for the citizens of this country. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year in this business of contracting. 
As Government provides services and, of course, provides capital expenditures for construction of roads, bridges, and buildings, that are a part of what we think is necessary, for the President to suggest a whole new dynamics as to how that contracting ought to come about, significantly skewing it toward organized labor is, at best, not being responsible to the taxpayers and, at worst, if I can simply say it, paying off for the great service provided in the last election by organized labor to the Democrat party. 
Is that a blunt and cold statement? Well, it is. But it falls on the heels of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of expenditures, targeted specifically at members of the Republican Party. And now I must say that it appears that union bosses were literally sitting inside the offices of this administration to help craft what we believed would be a significant change in the way the bidding process of a fair and competitive market would work on Government contracts. `Require Federal departments and agencies to evaluate whether a bidder for a Government contract has a satisfactory record of labor relations and other employment practices, in determining whether or not the bidder is a responsible contractor, eligible to receive a particular Government contract.' 
This regulation, if it were to become regulation under Executive order, would require the companies bidding for Federal contracts to have a spotless record of compliance throughout the Federal regulatory spectrum, including collective bargaining, wages, benefits, equal opportunity, health, and safety. 
In an era of regulatory overkill, when OSHA can issue a $13,200 fine to a roofing company for having a broken shovel in the back of a truck, my guess is there is hardly a potential contractor out there today that can meet all of this criteria. And now we have added dramatically to it a second possibility, `to prohibit Government reimbursement of Federal contracts for the costs they incur in unsuccessfully defending against or settling unfair labor practice complaints brought against them by the NLRB.' `Prohibit Government reimbursement of contractors for money they spend to fight unionization of their employees,' and so on and so forth. 
Why is it significant that we talk about this today? The Executive order that we are concerned about has not yet been issued. Well, here is the reason why we talk about it and think it is extremely important. It wasn't very long ago that the Vice President went before organized labor and suggested to them that there would be an Executive order sent forward on worker replacement, and it was. It took a Federal court action to strike down this particular action on the part of the administration as simply being outside the law in relation to the National Labor Relations Board and its ability to make decisions. And, therefore, it was an illegal act, or certainly an act outside the law, and the decision was struck down. 
Now, it is interesting that our Vice President would follow the same process. I think that we can suggest to the courts that this kind of an Executive order would fall under very similar kinds of guidelines that the one of a year ago did, because it probably falls under the Supreme Court's decision of 1986 of Wisconsin Department of Industries. 
I think what concerns all of us is the use of Executive order and rule and regulation on the part of this administration, instead of coming to the Congress of the United States and saying this is good policy. Do you mean this policy can't be debated on the floor of the Senate and voted on as a part of the law for contracting of Government programs? It should be, 
if that is how we are going to make public policy instead of by Executive order of the kind and the nature that is being talked about in this potential Executive order. Union-only subject agreements clearly have an exclusive and an anticompetitive nature to them. It is not for me to give an anti-union speech. Clearly, companies that are unionized ought to have every right to bid. But other companies that meet reasonable standards can compete over good bids, and do it in a fair and responsible way and provide the service to the Government as expected. They ought to have a right in that same market. That is exactly what George Bush said when he said it very clearly in 1992 in an Executive order requiring all Federal agencies to use an open competitive process for all Federal contracts. President Clinton's executive order would revoke this basically. That was revoked in 1983, and this would go even further to narrow it and define who could bid. It just so happens that only a limited few could bid. Last year, if this Executive order, as we understand it, were in place--I guess it is a contract for fiscal year 1993--it would have been well over 13 percent more of them at about $182 billion. 
In addition to contracts with major corporations, a study identified with contracts with Duke University, with Loyola University, and others, would fall subject to them and could well shut them off from their kind of contracts for research and development in the area of AIDS research in one and biomedical research in another. 
Mr. President, what our President proposes and what the Vice President has openly talked about to be expected this next week is in itself, in my opinion, a travesty of the way Government works and the way the executive and the legislative branch come together to build good public policy. This is special interest group legislating in the worst form. It is very bold, and it is very open. But, then again, hundreds of millions of dollars worth of campaign contributions later, I guess they can figure they can be that bold and that open because, certainly, in the shadow of what has occurred in the last election, this appears to be a response to those kinds of levels of participation. 
I thank my colleague and the Senator from Georgia for bringing this issue to the floor. It must be talked about. It must be understood openly by the American people. And, as I say, what the American people want for their tax dollar, its expenditure for and purchase of Government services and the need for capital expenditure within the Government is a fair and open bidding process and a good product in the end. Certainly, the President at this moment may well be accused of attempting to skew that into less competitive and most assuredly a less open process. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this morning, I stand to introduce with my colleague from New Mexico, Jeff Bingaman, legislation that will be called the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1997. I think we have all heard of the old adage that `an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.' That is very true in the legislation that we are proposing today, along with our colleagues from the House. 
Simply stated, medical nutrition therapy involves the assessment of the nutritional status of patients with a condition, illness, or injury that puts them at nutritional risk. Once a problem is identified, a registered dietitian can work with the patient to develop a personal therapy or treatment. Almost 17 million Americans each year, mostly the elderly, are treated for chronic illnesses or injuries that place them at risk of malnutrition. But because of medical nutrition therapy, in many instances, this can be resolved. The only problem today is that these preventive measures are not covered by Medicare. 
Our legislation would simply provide coverage under Medicare part B for medical nutrition therapy services furnished by registered dietitians and nutrition professionals. This is necessary so that the elderly are not denied effective low-technology treatment of their needs. I had the privilege of touring several hospitals in Idaho where medical nutrition therapy is now being used, and the results are dramatic. 
As we begin to closely examine our Medicare system, we must focus on the modernization of a 30-year-old health insurance system for the elderly. We need to make sure that it is truly modern, not only in its payment, its application, its style, but in the broad array of health care services that it responds to. Today, many private health insurance programs recognize medical nutrition therapy. Now, it is time that Medicare did. 
I hope my colleagues will join with Senator Bingaman and myself, as we introduce the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act. It is important that we begin to recognize these services and provide coverage under Medicare part B. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, an estimated 30 million taxpayers will file their Federal income tax returns today. They will be among the more than 100 million households filing returns so far this year. 
Most of these households do not have charitable feelings about the process to which their Government has just subjected them. 
Today, tax day, is the right day to call for tax relief, tax reform, and reform of the Internal Revenue Service. 
The Tax Foundation has announced today that tax freedom day for 1997 will be May 9--128 days into the year and later than it has ever been in our taxpaying history. 
Mr. President, our colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], is a student of classical history. I read recently that subjects in some of the outer provinces of the Roman Empire stirred up civil unrest when Roman plus local taxation reached an estimated 25 percent of their income. 
Today, the typical American family of four pays 38 percent of its income in taxes at all levels--working 3 hours of every 8-hour day just to pay taxes. 
Tax-and-spend liberals don't like it when taxpayers are reminded that it is the taxpayer's money--not the Government's --that is taken in taxes. 
I continue to support reasonable, fair tax relief that is pro-family and pro-economic growth. 
Among other efforts, today, I am joining again as an original cosponsor, with Senator Ashcroft, of the Working Americans Wage Restoration Act. 
American wage-earners are double taxed. They pay Social Security taxes and income taxes twice on the same wages. The least they deserve to an above-the-line deduction against their income taxes for the taxes they pay into Social Security. 
Too often within government, common sense is the least common kind of sense. 
The Ashcroft-Craig bill would be one important step in the right direction. 
American workers and their families need tax relief as soon as we can enact it. They are also clamoring for fundamental tax reform. 
Compliance with the current Federal income tax system costs 5.4 billion hours a year and $200 billion--$700 for every man, woman, and child in America. 
The IRS publishes 480 different tax forms, and another 280 forms to explain the first 480 forms. 
If laid end-to-end, the 8 billion pages of instructions sent out by the IRS every year would circle the Earth 28 times. 
The Internal Revenue Code is too complex, produces arbitrary results, and is far too involved in social engineering. 
It is costing the Government the trust and confidence of the American people. 
That's why Senator Shelby and I will reintroduce the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act--the flat tax bill--in the coming weeks. 
Our bill would create a single, flat, tax rate of 17 percent. Families of modest and middle-class means would be protected--by a personal exemption amounting to $33,800 for a family of four. 
A fair, flat tax system would reward work, promote savings and economic growth, and increase willing compliance with the law. As much as Americans distrust the tax laws, they fear the tax collector who enforces them. 
Small wonder: Drug dealers, child molesters, and organized crime hit men have more legal rights than an average taxpayer whom the IRS suspects of underpaying his or her taxes. 
Blatant disregard for individuals' rights has all been in pursuit of one goal: Get the money. 
An ever-growing Federal Government, with its voracious appetite for taxpayers' hard-earned dollars, has led Congresses dominated for decades by tax-and-spend liberals to expand the powers of the Internal Revenue Service and allow the agency to ignore the due process of law protections to which American citizens otherwise have been entitled. 
Americans expect to enjoy due process of the law as one of their fundamental rights. But that's not the case when you're dealing with the IRS. 
Most of the time, if a criminal suspect is not publicly attracting the attention of a law enforcement officer, no one from the government--from the FBI to the local sheriff--can search their home or seize their property without a warrant from an impartial court, based upon a showing of probable cause. 
But if the IRS thinks someone has underpaid their taxes, it can seize cars and freeze bank accounts on its own authority--without obtaining any kind of impartial, prior approval. 
It can consider the taxpayer guilty until proven innocent. It can impose costly penalties until the taxpayer--sometimes after years of court proceedings--conclusively proves they did nothing wrong. 
So-called `horror stories' about the IRS are multiplying. Sometimes the problem is brought on by a Tax Code that is too complicated even for the IRS to understand. Sometimes the problem is with IRS agents who act outside the law. And sometimes, it happens when IRS officials push to the limit the legal powers they've been granted by past Congresses and Presidents. In any case, there's never an excuse for such behavior. 
Congress is now investigating these incidents. We are working to make the IRS more accountable and the process fairer. 
One of these efforts will take a major step closer to becoming law today--S. 522, the `anti-snooping' bill introduced by Senator Coverdell. I am proud to be a cosponsor. 
This bill will clamp down on rogue IRS agents and put a stop to the unauthorized inspection of taxpayers' information. Years into the age of the computer, this is overdue. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
Congress never should have granted powers to the IRS that allow it--that, in fact, have encouraged it--to trample the due process rights that all Americans should enjoy. 
Criminal activity by individual, rogue IRS agents should not be hidden behind a shield of sovereign immunity. 
We will pass the anti-snooping bill today. It is one small part of a larger reform package that still needs to be passed. 
Many of the other needed reforms are included in another of Senator Coverdell's bills, S. 365, the IRS Accountability Act. I am also proud to be a cosponsor of that bill, as well. 
No people can remain free, or their government effective, if they do not display trust and confidence in each other. 
Yet America's tax system increasingly eats like a corrosive acid at these very bonds of support and legitimacy. 
I am committed to the three-step program necessary to restore fairness to the tax system and trust to the people: 
Pro-family, pro-growth tax relief; a simpler, fairer, flatter Tax Code; and reform for the tax collector, increasing accountability and requiring the IRS to treat the taxpayer with dignity, respect, and due process of the law.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to address a specific provision of the Murkowski substitute amendment to Senate bill 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. This provision is also in the bill as introduced, and was in similar legislation passed by this body in the last session of Congress. This provision is of special importance to my State and I wish, therefore, to clarify its appearance in this important legislation. I refer specifically to section 101, entitled `Obligations of the Secretary of Energy,' paragraph (f), which states, `Nothing in this act is intended to or shall be construed to modify . . . obligations imposed upon the Federal Government by the U.S. District Court of Idaho in an order entered on October 17, 1995, in United States v. Batt (No. 91-0054-S-EJL).' 
Mr. President, the consent order referred to in section 101 of S. 104 binds the State of Idaho, through the Attorney General, and Gov. Philip E. Batt in his official capacity; the Department of Energy, through the general counsel and assistant secretary for environmental management; and the Department of the Navy, through the general counsel and director, Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program to certain terms and conditions to fully resolve all issues in the actions Public Service Co. of Colorado versus Batt and United States versus Batt.

The consent order has a number of compliance points requiring action by the U.S. Department of Energy at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, which have bearing on the overall spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste management storage and disposal program as structured in Senate bill 104. In general terms, the consent order requires specific actions for treatment, storage, disposal, or shipment offsite for disposal of spent fuel and waste at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, and requires these actions to be performed according to a timetable set down in the consent order.

Mr. CRAIG. As I know my colleague from Alaska is aware, the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory has, over the course of its history, received commercial spent nuclear fuel for research and development purposes. One of the largest receipts was the receipt of the discharged core from the Three Mile Island nuclear powerplant 
in the 1980's. Idaho has also received, and continues to store, expended fuel from naval nuclear reactors. One of the key provisions of the consent order is that the DOE is ordered to remove all spent fuel, including naval spent fuel and Three Mile Island spent fuel from Idaho by January 1, 2035.

Mr. CRAIG. The consent order limits shipments of naval spent nuclear fuel into Idaho. Specifically, the total number of shipments of naval spent fuel to Idaho through 2035 shall not exceed 575 shipments and shall not exceed 55 metric tons. Most relevant to our discussion of Senate bill 104, however, is the Department of Energy's commitment, through this settlement agreement, that naval spent fuel stored at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory on the date of the opening of a permanent repository or interim storage facility shall be among the early shipments of spent fuel to the first permanent repository or interim storage facility.

Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from Alaska is correct. The consent order settlement agreement contains a provision that, except for a narrow exception for the treatment of graphite fuel from the Fort St. Vrain reactor in Colorado, the Department of Energy will make no shipments of spent fuel from commercial nuclear powerplants to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Therefore, selection of Idaho for further commercial fuel storage would be inconsistent with and in violation of the consent order.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senate has before it at this moment, and has for some days, through tomorrow, the consideration of Senate bill 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. 
Senator Frank Murkowski, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and myself, along with a good number of others of our colleagues, have recognized the need for this Government and this Congress to clarify its position on high-level nuclear waste and spent fuel in compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 1987. 
As a result of that recognition, that is exactly what we are doing. We are certainly encouraging at this moment a resounding passage of this bill tomorrow. 
Mr. President, last week my colleague from Alaska, the chairman of the committee, introduced the substitute. I am discouraged that in spite of all the work we have done, the administration has not withdrawn its veto threat of this legislation. 
We have listened to the other side. We have incorporated amendments from the other side. We have now picked up substantially more Members from the other side who are supporting this bill. 
I have recently reviewed, once again, the basis for the veto threat and I find no remaining legitimate reason for this administration to be in opposition. 
Let me address just a couple of specifics for just a few moments. 
The statement of administration policy states that S. 104 would effectively establish Nevada as the site of an interim nuclear storage facility before a viability assessment of Yucca Mountain is completed. Not true. Mr. President, let me repeat, that is an untrue statement.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand on the floor today to speak against the Reid-Bryan amendment as it relates to Governors' authority on transportation of materials through their States. 
My colleague from Nevada, who is not only a U.S. Senator but a former Governor of that State, just said something that I found fascinating in the context of this legislation or this amendment. In a dialog with his colleague, the other Senator from Nevada, he suggested that with all of the safeguards and the protections put in, couldn't you go to a Governor and logically argue with him and, therefore, convince him to just sign off, Governor? 
My guess is that as a former Governor of the State of Nevada or a Governor today in Nevada, with all these safeguards, he wouldn't sign off--not because of the science, not because of the engineering, but because of the politics. Plain and simple politics is what is dictating the argument on the floor today--not science, not engineering, not the facts. So, sign off, Governor. Just sign off, and everything will be fine. And the Governor looks over his back shoulder, he looks at the polls, and he sees that the citizens of his State do not want nuclear waste stored in their State no matter how good the science, no matter how good the engineering, no matter how good the record, no matter how good the history of that record. What does he do? Is he the statesman that he should be? Not at all. He is the politician that he is. He says, `My reelection is in trouble if I do thus and so.' 
Why do I speak in this manner? Because Idaho went through that very experience. Idaho has a large amount of interim storage of high-level nuclear material. And a former Governor of our State got a Federal court order to stop the shipment of that waste coming into the State. But could he get the Federal court to ultimately say no waste movement to Idaho? No; what he could get, what any Governor can get, what our S. 104 provides, and what current law provides is that he could assure that the condition in which that waste would be stored both long-term or short-term would be safe, would be environmentally sound, and would not put at risk or put in danger the citizens of that State. 
Why could the Governor not absolutely say, `It cannot cross my borders'? Because we are no longer a confederation of States. We almost fell apart as a nation when we were a confederation. We are now a union bound together by a Constitution that speaks very specifically to interstate commerce, and the ability of a Governor or a State to block the movement of materials or commerce across its border. But what we do say--and what we defend and what S. 104 clearly spells out--is that the Governor of the State and the State itself can condition the movement of materials across its border. 
That is exactly what the State of Idaho did. My Governor over the last several years has signed agreements with the Department of Energy under a Federal court order that conditions the waste that still comes to Idaho across many borders up the rails from Norfolk, VA, to Idaho--2,500-plus miles, 600 shipments over 30 years, and never an accident--with never a human put at risk by the spill of radioactive activity. 
I am not suggesting nor am I attempting to impugn the integrity of the Senators from Nevada. They will do what they must do because they have the right to do it. But let me suggest they do not have the science, and they do not have the engineering. They only have the politics. 
When you look at the amendment that they proposed and at the legislation that the Senator from Alaska, I, and the committee crafted, when you talk about the intricacies of laws, when you look at the legislation that is now law, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, known as HAZMAT which involves the States, which assures that States and Federal transportation of hazardous materials is in concert, that humans are safe and humans are protected, but the reality is that to provide greater protection for the broader good and for the national interests sometimes State borders must be crossed. The HAZMAT system has adopted a uniform, regulated approach toward handling materials regardless of their type. Regulations of these materials allow States authority to conduct certain inspections, and we have even extended that. We have created greater authority in this legislation because several of our Senators--and rightfully so--are concerned about the movement of radioactive materials across their States. And I am concerned when States are not generators of it. My State is a partial generator but a much larger store in a temporary way of waste. 
This second-degree amendment is not just some conditioning amendment. This kills S. 104. This changes the whole character and the context of what the bill itself would do. The Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the committee, has so clearly said that this gives every Governor in every State absolute authority to cancel, stop, or otherwise terminate movement across State borders. We have really never given States that authority. And we should not here. But we have continually done it. And I have argued for it on many occasions under many different examples and legislation that is now law. States have very clear rights. They have 10th amendment rights. And those rights are very strong as it relates to the ability of States to govern themselves and control themselves, and not have the Federal Government impugn that authority, or dictate that authority, or change the character of that authority. But one thing that a State cannot do is lock and block its borders. 
That is, of course, the reason that 208 years ago many of what we now call our Founding Fathers joined in Philadelphia to try to figure out how to get our States back together because we were falling apart largely because States had that kind of absolute authority. The States of Maryland and Virginia were shooting at each other across the Potomac River, or at least 
some of their interests were. And the Confederation was falling apart. That was one of the early parts of a Constitution, to make sure that commerce could flow. 
I think all of the Senators on the floor would argue that this isn't the best form of commerce, and this isn't like what we would like to think of as commerce. But we clearly recognize that in the national interest, when it comes to the rights of States, that the principles of federalism on which our country was founded recognize States' authority to govern matters within their borders but must give way to Federal authority when an issue is one of national scope reaching beyond the particular boundaries of a given State. This is an interesting combination. 
This is not only an issue of national scope. This is a Federal material going to a Federal property--not a private property, not a State-owned property, but Federal land in the State of Nevada. The Senators from Nevada and I are oftentimes very perplexed because we are representatives of States that have very large Federal domains. Sometimes we wish a great amount of that land could either be public-State land, and in some instances private land, but that is not the way it is, and that is not the way our States came into the Union. As a result, we are talking about building an interim storage facility, after viability determination, facilitating a deep geologic repository, long term. And it is not true that this is just going to happen and the Nevada test site was just chosen. Certainly this argument deserves merit. I know it can have the emotion, and I certainly know it has its politics because I live with nuclear radioactive politics in my State every day because we are a repository temporarily of large volumes of high-level waste from our nuclear Navy. I also know that it has been handled safely for decades, and it is a sound place to store it on a temporary basis until such time as a permanent repository is developed. 
As I have mentioned, over 600 shipments have moved across numerous State borders from as far away as from Norfolk, VA, to the deserts of Idaho. And it has been done safely, soundly, and responsibly because of our country's recognition of the risk and the liability to human safety. And we have never compromised a human, and we never will. 
We cannot kill S. 104. I hope that when the Senator from Alaska places the tabling motion that our colleagues will join with us to table the second-degree amendment because there is no question about its intent. I believe it is not a constitutional amendment. But then again we don't judge the Constitution here on the floor. We only try to live with it and live under it. That is not ours to make that judgment. But I do not believe the courts of our country would allow the Governor of the State of Nevada or Idaho the privilege of absolute cancellation, or absolute border blockage. 
And that is, of course, in my opinion, what this amendment ultimately does. So I would ask my colleagues to join with us, those who support S. 104, in the need to recognize the importance of the building of a national deep geological repository for high-level materials and high-level nuclear spent fuel and that they would vote down the second-degree amendment and vote for the tabling motion. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from Nevada said you and I portrayed the transportation as safe as transporting a quart of milk home from the store. I think the record ought to be corrected. The transportation system for nuclear waste is safer than transporting a quart of milk home. 
Have you ever dropped a quart of milk on the floor of the supermarket or on the floor of the kitchen? I have, and I have burst the container. You can drop these containers 50 feet onto a piece of concrete and they do not burst. That is the characteristics of the container. 
I think, when we also get in our car at the supermarket and drive home, we do not have a police escort in front of us and behind us, making sure that the road is perfectly clear so someone does not sideswipe us at the intersection or hit us as we are leaving. 
I know what the Senator from Nevada was trying to do. But the reality is, the transportation of high-level radioactive materials in this country is, by far, much safer than transporting a quart of milk home from the supermarket. There is a lot of milk spilled between the supermarket and the kitchen of the average residence in our country. But to our knowledge not one curie of radioactivity has ever been spilled going from a reactor to a storage site, once it was containerized and in its mode of transportation. 
I thank my colleague for yielding. That is an important correction. We ought not make light of our arguments here because the facts are very clear when it comes to transporting this critical material.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I address this body to express my support of S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. 
Today, I wish to address specifically provisions of the substitute amendment introduced yesterday by the chairman, my colleague from Alaska. 
Before I discuss the details of our substitute amendment, however, I would like to set the backdrop for my remarks. 
This week, while debating the motion to proceed, you have heard my colleague from Alaska, the able chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, invite those who say they cannot support provisions of this bill, S. 104, to suggest alternatives. 
I hope all of my colleagues heard this invitation and I know some of my colleagues accepted this invitation. 
The provisions of our substitute are a product of this invitation, to participate with us in solving this national problem--the problem of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste, and how to address this problem in a timely manner. 
We have listened to those who have expressed concerns about this legislation. 
In our effort to continue and enhance the strong bipartisan support for this legislation, our substitute addresses, point-by-point, the concerns expressed by the other side. 
Let me discuss these changed provisions. 
First, we had heard concerns that the schedule outlined in S. 104 for the development of an interim storage facility is unrealistic. 
Mr. President, our substitute now extends the schedule for siting and licensing of the interim storage facility: from the original proposal of the year 1999, we now have a facility operating in 2003. 
But let me talk about why we have extended the schedule. 
The interim storage facility will be licensed by fully exercising all provisions of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing process. 
We have extended the schedule for environmental reviews. 
We have extended the schedule for public involvement in this licensing process. 
Let me repeat this. 
We have heard allegations that S. 104 does not allow for public involvement. 
Public involvement during licensing has always been part of the S. 104 process for an interim storage facility. 
By extending our schedule to 2003, there will be even more time and ample opportunity for the public to participate in the licensing process. 
Another provision that is changed by our substitute is that we have shortened the license duration--the operating period--of the interim storage facility from 100 years to 40 years. 
We have also provided that the amount of fuel and high-level radioactive waste stored in the interim storage facility will be only that amount needed to fulfill the Government's obligations until a permanent repository is available. 
Mr. President, we are not looking for a blank check on this facility. 
We propose to build only what is needed to stem the Government's looming financial liability under the lawsuit and the contracts signed in 1982. 
We have accommodated our critics on their concerns regarding pre-emption of other laws. 
Our substitute now contains language virtually identical to the preemption provision of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. 
I hope this finally puts to rest the entirely misguided allegation that this legislation will gut environmental laws. 
That simply has never been the truth. 
The language of our substitute on the issue of preemption requires compliance with applicable environmental laws and hopefully puts this issue to rest. 
Finally, our substitute revises the approach to setting an environmental standard for the deep geologic repository.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to join Senators Hutchison of Texas and McCain, Chairman Stevens, our majority leader, Senator Lott, and others, as an original cosponsor of the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. 
Under this bill, if fiscal year 1998 starts before any of the 13 regular appropriations bills become law, no part of the Government would shut down because of the delay. 
Funding would automatically continue at 98 percent of fiscal year 1997 levels. 
Some of us feel 98 percent is too high. And automatic continuing appropriations may not be the perfect way to fund programs. 
But this process would meet two important tests, best described by two old, familiar rules of thumb: 
There is an old saying: `When you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.' 
And we all know the First Rule of Medicine: `Do no harm.' 
These two rules of thumb explain why we need the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. 
This is not a long-term, structural change in the budget process. It's not a plan to balance the budget. But it is a very much-needed stopgap reform, in case of another budget impasse. Indeed, it may prevent such an impasse. 
It will help us work toward a balanced budget, without disrupting the lives and work of millions of innocent bystanders, both inside and outside the Federal Government. 
The first step toward balancing the budget is, stop digging. 
For 36 of the last 37 years, the government has overspent. Every year, no matter what the process, no matter what the negotiations, spending goes up. 
Many times--not just last year--liberals have threatened to shut down the government if they didn't get their spending hikes. 
This bill says, `No More!' to that upward spiral. If there's gridlock, at least spending will not go up as a result. It will go down, just slightly. 
We also need to remind the budget doctors: Do no harm. 
In the last two Government shutdowns, in Idaho--We had a VA hospital wonder if it would have critical medicines on hand from week to week; we had small businesses wonder if they should deliver goods that Government offices had ordered--and if they would ever get paid; and we had Government workers first worry about feeding their families and making their house payments, and then outraged that they were ordered not to do the jobs they and other taxpayers were paying for. 
This bill says, `We will not allow these innocent Americans to be taken hostage again, by either side in a budget dispute.' 
Keeping the Government open at 98 percent of current spending is a responsible, fair, even generous formula. And it is consistent with the reasonable fiscal restraint that we have begun, with the last Congress, to work for. 
The time to pass this reform is now. 
Once the appropriations process begins in earnest, too many parties are going to look at any reform like this in terms of whether they win or lose, compared with what's in their appropriations bill, or what they might get if their allies threaten another Government shutdown. 
Now is the time we are most likely to see this reform judged on it own merits, for what it is: Shutdown prevention, a level playing field, legislation for the public good. 
I urge my colleagues to join as cosponsors of this bill, and to support every effort to enact this reform into law as quickly as possible.

<TEXT>
 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to transfer certain facilities at the Minidoka irrigation project to the Burley Irrigation District. The introduction of this legislation results from a hearing I held in the Senate Energy Committee in the past Congress and is nearly identical to S. 1291 from that Congress. I am introducing this project-specific legislation because it is obvious to me a general transfer bill is not workable; each reclamation project has unique qualities, and projects should be addressed individually or in distinct groupings. 
The Reclamation Act of 1902 was part of the history of Federal public land laws designed to transfer lands out of Federal ownership and to settle this Nation. The origins of that policy predate the Constitution and derive from the early debates that led to the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The particular needs and circumstances of the arid and semiarid lands west of the 100th meridian led to various proposals to reclaim the lands, including the Desert Land Act and the Carey Act. In his State of the Union Message of 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt finally called for the Federal Government to intervene to develop the reservoirs and works necessary to accomplish such irrigation. The reclamation program was enormously successful. It grew from the irrigation program contemplated by one President Roosevelt to the massive works constructed four decades later by the second President Roosevelt. For those of us in the Northwest, there is a very personal meaning to a line from Woody Guthrie's song about the Columbia that goes: `your power is turning our darkness to dawn, so roll on Columbia, roll on.' 
If what is known now had been known then, some projects may have been constructed differently. However, that is not the question we have before us. The central question is whether and to what extent the Federal Government should seek to transfer the title and responsibility for these projects. Has the Federal mission been accomplished? 
The best transfer case would be the single purpose irrigation or municipal and industrial [M&I] system that is fully repaid, operation has long since been transferred, and the water rights are held privately. That is the case with the Burley Irrigation District transfer. 
The transfer of title is not a new idea. Authority to transfer title to the All American Canal is contained in section 7 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928. General authority is contained in the 1955 Distribution Systems Loan Act. Recently, Congress passed legislation dealing with Elephant Butte and Vermejo. 
The Burley Irrigation District is part of the Minidoka project that was built under the authorization of the 1902. Reclamation Act. By a contract executed in 1926, the District assumed the operation and maintenance of the system. 
All construction contracts and costs for the canals system, pumping plants, power house, transmission lines and other improvements have been paid in full. Contracts for storage space at Minidoka, American Falls, and Palisades reservoirs have been paid in full, along with all maintenance fees. This project is a perfect example of the Federal Government maintaining only a bare title, and that title should now be transferred to the project recipients who have paid for the facilities and the rights of the Burley Irrigation District.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the unanimous consent that our chairman has just put before the Senate and has been accepted is good news. It is good news that we can move immediately to consideration of S. 104 starting tomorrow afternoon. 
I think it also portends what we all know here, that S. 104 has a substantial majority support in this Senate and the Senators from Nevada recognize, and we appreciate their recognition of the fact, that this is an issue that is of national scope. While I understand and appreciate their strong defense of Nevada, I also can recognize the need to speak nationally about a national problem and the responsiveness of States, like yours and like mine, who wish to find safe, sound, environmentally recognized storage locations for both high-level waste and nuclear spent fuel, to seek that location in the Yucca Mountain facility that is currently under investigation. 
What I wish to do this afternoon is address several points that have been raised by my colleagues from Nevada, some of them yesterday, and some of them today. Before I do that, however, I want to turn briefly to the subject of underground nuclear weapons testing. Yesterday, I addressed this body and discussed in general terms the Nevada test site. I referred to a photo which I have here again behind me which is the Nevada test site. I asked my assembled colleagues to consider whether an interim storage site for spent nuclear fuel and waste could really have a detrimental impact on this land. Every one of the pockmarks in the landscape is a product of underground explosions of nuclear devices. This is the most exploded area on the face of the Earth, maybe other than where the late Soviet Union once did its underground testing, once it had stopped its atmospheric testing. 
What I am suggesting is that this is not a pristine environment. It is a place where it is reasonable and responsible, if the kinds of geologic testing that are now going on confirm the fact that we can build an underground deep geologic repository near this location, then we can put an interim storage facility here it would ultimately serve as a receiving and conditioning facility for transferring the waste to the deep underground geologic storage. 
Weapons explosions have gone on here for decades. As I listened to my colleague, the senior Senator from Nevada yesterday, I got the sense that he is dead set against any nuclear materials in his State of Nevada. All I have to do is remind the Senators of Nevada, this is Nevada. This is where, for decades, our nuclear testing has gone on, on Federal properties, in that State. Is it not reasonable to assume that the Senate ought to have the right to look at and make consideration of this facility as an interim site? 
I recall, however, that last year my colleague from Nevada did support the restart of underground nuclear testing at this very site. Now, Mr. President, I do not mention this to be critical to any Member who supported the testing program--the kind of program which is vital to both States and to our national interests. Defense missions are important, and we have to recognize and balance the issues. When I say that, of course, I defend the right of my colleagues to defend their interest. But it is time we look at national interests in the context and in the balance. Let us talk about what underground nuclear tests involve. 
These pockmarks, as you see here, represent the drilling of a deep hole and the exploding of a nuclear device within that. These explosions leave all of these same nuclear components--the same ones that we talked about as being contained in the spent fuel and the high-level waste that we want to dispose of in an underground storage facility near the test site. I suggest, Mr. President, the kind of storage we are talking about is going to be quantum safer, quantum safer, than the kind of explosive activities that went on this terrain during the past decades. Nuclear testing was allowed at this site for decades. To our knowledge it has not caused serious concerns for the water table, or the types of standards we are requiring for a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain. 
Now, I ask my colleagues to consider this. I want to quote from my former colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, Bennett Johnston, when we debated this matter last session. This is Senator Bennett Johnston speaking. `If it is safe to conduct hundreds of nuclear tests, it is much more safe to store * * * nuclear waste under Yucca Mountain in containers which themselves pose quite a barrier to any contamination.' 
Now, I wish to address several comments that I heard yesterday, because I believe some clarification, or even correction, is necessary. We heard from our Nevada colleagues that the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board has said that an interim storage facility is simply not needed. For the benefit of my colleagues who were not present at the committee hearing on February 5, I am compelled to quote directly from the Chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, Dr. Cohon, in his testimony before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Under the heading of `Key Conclusions,' Dr. Cohon said: `A centralized storage facility will be needed.' 
Let me repeat that. Dr. Cohon, Chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, said: `A centralized storage facility will be needed. Planning for it should begin immediately.' 
However, he did go on to state: `There are no compelling technical or safety reasons to move spent fuel to a centralized storage facility for the next few years.' 
`Technical or safety reasons * * *.' 
Mr. President, you will notice that Dr. Cohon is silent on the other reasons--contractual obligations, lawsuits, failure to implement the 1998 deadline of the current waste act, financial liabilities. 
Furthermore, as we all know and the DOE has acknowledged, it will take more than a few years to license and construct an interim storage facility. Even if we were to begin today, right now, immediately, it is still going to take time to make it happen and to make it happen through all of the Federal laws and with an environmentally safe, sound, and acceptable design. 
Dr. Cohon testified that steps leading to centralized storage `should begin immediately.' That is exactly what Dr. Cohon was speaking of. S. 104 directs that the steps leading to that interim storage be initiated. 
Let me quote from the board's second key conclusion on the interim storage: `Significant advantages can be derived from siting a storage facility adjacent to the repository.' 
That is what the board has said. That is exactly what S. 104 does. For some reason, it is very difficult, if not absolutely incorrect, to portray that S. 104 is somewhere out of step with the current Nuclear Waste Policy Act or with the board's finding--this board of technical and professional people who had been brought together for the purpose of establishing the findings necessary to build a permanent repository. 
Dr. Cohon goes on to recommend that an interim storage facility be located at the Nevada Test Site only after site viability is determined. 
Mr. President, let me dismiss another allegation from our opponents--that S. 104 short-circuits the viability process. It flat doesn't happen, and the bill doesn't proceed in that manner. S. 104 sites an interim storage facility at the Nevada Test Site after site viability is complete--not before viability, not instead of viability, but after viability. That is what the language of the proposed law says. 
I am growing weary of a variety of charges that relate to S. 104 short-circuiting the science of the waste program. That is the argument that has been placed by my opponents, that somehow the scientific progress gets short-circuited. That is unfounded. It is done to create fear among those who have not studied the issue thoroughly. It is always important on issues like nuclear waste and high-level nuclear radioactive materials that science be a major player. Therefore, it is always easy to wave the flag of `no science' and say it is an unsafe action or we should not be doing that. That simply is not the case here; it has never been the case. The scientists have been at the forefront of all of these actions, and they have led the development of the whole process to the point of where we are. 
This brings me to another area that has been the subject of misinformation. My guess is that it is just going to be the subject of misinformation throughout the debate--the issue of 
transportation. During my remarks yesterday, I went through, in some detail, the tests that are required to be performed before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will license the containers that are used to transport spent nuclear fuel over highways or railways. What I would like to do is repeat that this has never been an issue, and it isn't an issue now. That isn't to say it isn't a political issue; it is a political issue, but it cannot be argued on scientific grounds, on engineering grounds and, most important, after the 2,500 loads of nuclear material that have traveled across this country over the last several decades, it cannot even be argued after the fact that somehow there was an accident that resulted in human injury as a result of radiation. There were accidents, but the containers and the material were totally safe. 
We did hear an allegation yesterday that it is so dangerous to transport these materials that we have never successfully licensed a shipping vessel for transportation of spent fuel. The fact is, not only have spent fuel shipping containers been successfully tested and licensed, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission currently has over 20 different types of shipping containers--not 20 different containers, but 20 different types of shipping containers--that it has successfully licensed. Let me repeat that. It has successfully licensed them for use over highways or railways. These are containers that have passed all of the tremendously rigorous tests that I outlined for you yesterday, such as the drop test, the puncture test, the fire test, the water immersion test; all of them have been licensed under those standards. 
This brings me to another erroneous charge that I wish to dismiss. It is the charge that these testing requirements are not adequate to meet real-life accidents. Oh, my goodness. I can't imagine that even could be suggested. You don't drop a metal container 50 feet onto a hard, immovable concrete slab and have that container bounce and stay whole time after time and even suggest that the test itself wasn't real life. It is extraordinary. It is well beyond the norm. 
We have heard that the fire test requires a temperature of only 1,475 degrees Fahrenheit and that gasoline fires can burn hotter than this. Well, we need to look at all of the parameters of the fire test to see if it is tough enough for real-life accident conditions. 
In response to the gasoline concern, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was asked to investigate if the fire temperature required for testing was hot enough. They concluded that when you look at all of the fire parameters, not just temperature, but duration, insulation, how the container is positioned in the flame, look at all of these factors in combination, actual fires would not exceed in overall severity the fire test that the shipping containers must go through. Now, this is one of the best scientific labs in the world. This is the best test that you can create anywhere to check the integrity of the container. After doing so, they said that the container was adequate to meet the standards and the risks involved. 
The overall point is that these issues and allegations have been investigated, tested, studied, and, in every case, they have been ultimately debunked. Again, my argument, my premise is that this debate has nothing to do with science, nothing to do with geology, to date, nothing to do with engineering facts. Those have all been established for decades. Those facts are unrefutable. It has everything to do with politics. 
There are enough studies and papers on these issues to fill technical libraries at every national laboratory across the country, including the Idaho National Laboratory. It is time to move beyond the hyperbole and scare tactics.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, when it comes to establishing national priorities--and I know what our President is doing in the area that I am about to discuss now--it is a great frustration to many States across our Nation because this President refuses--I repeat, refuses--to take a firm position and 
establish as a national priority in this country the appropriate handling of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste in a way that is acceptable to the American people and commensurate with the public law. 
So what I am about to speak to is a piece of Senate legislation that I and the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee introduced on this floor last year, and that we passed last year in the U.S. Senate with 63 votes--63 bipartisan voices that said that this administration was wrong with their policy, and wrong with their priorities when it came to honoring public law and the 42 States that felt it necessary that this President honor public law. I am talking about the expeditious and timely management of high-level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel. 
For all the right reasons, our Nation has spent a long time generating radioactive materials--nearly five decades. Most of this material is the byproduct of two principal activities: National defense operations, and commercial nuclear power plants. While it was our national policy for well over five decades that the Federal Government have oversight and primacy in the area of management and control of nuclear materials, it is no longer, tragically enough, a high-level policy of this country that is discernible by administrative position and by the clearness of administrative leadership. That is why we are here today on the floor of the U.S. Senate debating a timely action that this country must take to be responsible for the five decades of activity in the generation of high-level radioactive waste. 
What I am talking about clearly is a national concern. To ignore this responsibility would be unwise, irresponsible, and in some instances, with regard to taking timely action, unsafe. 
I am pleased now to rise in support of Senate bill 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. As I mentioned, last year I and the Senator from Alaska were here on the floor with the Senators from Nevada debating a similar bill, although this year we have changed the bill some by actions in the committee itself and by possible amendments that will be made here on the floor during the course of the debate and the final vote on this legislation. 
What we are talking about is the timely storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste from our Nation's defense program and from, of course, the commercial nuclear power plants. Senate bill 104 creates an integrated system that will ensure construction of an interim storage facility and permanent repository to manage spent fuel and high-level waste that is currently stored in over 80 sites in 41 States across this country. 
I have in the backdrop a map of our country that demonstrates the locations of reactors and storage sites, 80 sites in 41 States. Yet our administration basically has had no policy for nearly two decades on this issue. 
We spoke as a Congress and we spoke as a people in 1982: That there needed to be a national policy and a national program. The legislation that we have before us, in my opinion, demonstrates that kind of critical need, and the need also to operate and respond in a timely fashion. 
Transferring nuclear waste from the many defense and commercial nuclear sites to a single Federal facility beginning in 1998 was the intent of the Congress and the President of the United States when the Nuclear Waste Policy Act passed in 1982. 
It became law. It was signed by the President. It was a national commitment. It was this Nation speaking to the need to handle the kind of waste that I am talking about and to do so in a safe and responsible fashion. 
Unbelievably, we are less than one year away--just 9 months--from the date when the Department of Energy is obligated by the law that was passed in 1982 and is obligated under contract, in response to the law signed and honored by our Government, to accept the waste. Now we have to come to the floor in the 11th hour and plead with this administration to come with us in the shaping of 
national policy to deal with this issue. Just last year the U.S. Court of Appeals reaffirmed the Federal obligation. 
The Nevada test site was selected in the early 1970's as one of the sites under consideration for a geologic repository. This site has been under study for now over two decades by scientists and engineers. Here is a photograph of the Nevada test site where the interim storage facility would be located. Scientists and engineers at Yucca Mountain near this site where a permanent geologic repository for these high-level wastes would be placed have conducted the most thorough and comprehensive geological survey ever undertaken on any piece of property on the face of the Earth. 
Let me repeat that claim because I believe it to be valid. The site that we are looking at, the Yucca Mountain deep geologic repository, has been studied more thoroughly, more comprehensively, both from a geologic point of view, from a seismic point of view, and from the overall need to meet the certification process for it to be a permanent, safe, high-level waste repository--that site has been more comprehensively studied than any piece of real estate on the face of the Earth. During all of this time and all of the studies, nothing has been discovered which would indicate that this site is unsuitable for use as a repository. 
Because of the endless bureaucratic delays that have plagued the program, the Federal Government now says it will not have a repository operating until the year 2010 at the earliest. Remember, this was a Federal Government that in 1982 signed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act committing by contract to take the waste by 1998, 9 months from now. Yet this administration and their representatives at the Department of Energy shrugged their shoulders and said, `Well, gee, the year 2010 will have to do because we just can't get there.' Yet the courts last year said `Wrong. Foul ball. Go back to home plate. You have to abide by the law.' And the Department of Energy said, `Yes. You are right. We do have to do that. We recognized that.' 
This is 12 years after the Federal Government is contractually obligated to take title to and remove spent fuel from civilian power plants. Electric consumers and taxpayers have committed approximately $12 billion solely to study, test and build a radioactive waste management system. So when the Federal Government made its obligation in 1982 to the taxpayer, but most importantly the ratepayer of the utilities that were generating electricity through nuclear power, and the Government owed this commitment by paying out money to build the facility, to do the siting, to do the studies, to do all of the test work and to have a facility ready to operate and receive by 1998. That was a $12 billion commitment and $4.5 billion of that money has already been spent. This chart will give you an idea of where the moneys come from. 
So, in other words, these were the folks that made the commitments. These were the folks that signed the contracts. These were the folks that believed that the Federal Government was an honorable agent that would honor those contracts. And the courts just this past year said, `You are right. The Federal Government has to do it.' And the administration says, `Well, we can't do it. In fact, we probably won't be able to do it until 2010, or sometime beyond.' 
We enjoy the benefits of having the world's most reliable and powerful electricity supplies to drive our economy. In supplying more than 20 percent of the Nation's electricity, nuclear energy is part of the foundation of our Nation's high standard of living and economic growth. Twenty percent of the lights in our country, of the industry in our country, of the economy of our country, is fueled by nuclear power plants. 
Mr. President, here is the thing that frustrates me most. I am going to quote from the President of the United States, this President. This is the President who doesn't have any idea how he will honor the commitment that the courts said just this last year he has to honor. This is the President who, in my opinion, has established the most antinuclear policy and attitude of any President since Harry Truman. Yet, this President this year in his fiscal 1998 budget request for the Department of Energy includes the following statement. 
He says, or the Department of Energy says, this President's Department of Energy:  
[Nuclear power] plants represent a $200 billion investment by electric ratepayers and provide reliable baseload power without emitting harmful pollutants such as those associated with global climate change. 
In other words, it is this President who recognizes that nuclear power or electrical power generated by nuclear energy is the safest, the cleanest, and provides a huge investment of $200 billion. Yet, this is the President who shrugs his shoulders and says, `But we don't know what to do with the waste. We do not have a policy. We cannot react.' 
I agree with the statement that I just quoted from the Department of Energy's fiscal year 1998 budget. Nuclear power is a major generator. Nuclear power is safe. Nuclear power is clean. Responsible management and disposal of spent fuel from these plants is a vital component of the energy security of this country and is, in my opinion, the No. 1 environmental issue that we face. Managing the waste stream safely and soundly is the No. 1 environmental issue in 41 States at 81 sites across this country.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, before I speak in relation to the motion to proceed on S. 104, let me only say to the minority leader of the Senate, with due respect to him--and I do respect Senator Daschle--the Senate and the leadership of the Senate and the House, for well over a month and a half, deferred to the President and the responsibility of the President in submitting a budget to Congress. I sat on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives and listened to our President refer to the submitting of a balanced budget; 12 times in the State of the Union address our President spoke of a balanced budget. We received that budget. No one chose, in their own good form, to criticize it. In fact, we sent it off to be analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office. And it came back. 
I must report to the minority leader that it was not a balanced budget, and we all know that now. It was well out of balance by nearly $100 billion for the 4 years of this President, with the inclusion of a major tax increase and some tax cuts. And then, of course, the year after this President leaves office, the tax cuts go away, the tax increases stay, and a major cut in programs or a major increase in revenue. That is why we haven't dealt with the budget, because we were willing to give this President the benefit of the doubt. Certainly the Senator knows that, and it was a fair willingness on our part. 
Now that that day has passed, the Senate is beginning to work its will on the budget. We first wanted the President to have a fair and uncriticized opportunity, and that is exactly what he got. But in all fairness, the public now knows that this President's budget includes major spending increases and major new Federal programs and no real commitment to balance, not in the context of the political reality that certainly the minority leader operates in and that we operate in. No Congress has made those kinds of dramatic cuts, nor, frankly, have they raised that much revenue as the President is proposing, because while he appears to give on one hand, he rapidly takes away on the other. 
In all instances, his program spending wraps up, a major increase in 1 year of $25 billion of new domestic spending in this country. That is what we are wrestling with. Certainly, this Senate is going to deal with the budget, and they are going to deal with it in a very timely manner. What I hope we can do is something that I know the minority leader will appreciate and that is to deal with it in a bipartisan way. That we can accomplish and we should accomplish. Already, moderate and conservative Democrats are speaking up and saying they can't deal with the President's budget, not in the context of our commitment. Our commitment was that if we would not support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, we could produce a balanced budget without it. 
Now, the Senator knows how disappointed I was that he worked so hard to destroy the vote on a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution, because I worked a long time to get that because I think that without it we won't get a balanced budget. But all the while he was working to change that vote and worked with the administration to do so, there was a constant drumbeat of promise to get us to a balanced budget by the year 2002. 
I know that the Senator was sincere in that commitment. We are committed to that commitment. But we cannot get there with the President's schedule of new spending, and we cannot get there with the President's new tax increases, and we cannot get there with doing all of the cuts and all of the changes in the fifth year after this President has left office. It must start now. It must ramp its way toward the year 2002. Let it be said--and I think it is important that it be said--that for the last 2 weeks, with the President's commitment and with the leadership's commitment, meetings have gone on. I think the only problem is that everybody has been sitting around at those meetings talking about how delightful it is that they are meeting, instead of time lines and 
commitments to the American people meeting what we have said to the American people we would give them, and that is, of course, a balanced budget by 2002. 
We need to start this year, not 4 years out. We don't need major tax increases to get there, and we can do so with reasonable responses to our domestic spending, not major new programs, but reprogramming, giving the priorities where it ought to be. Many of those is where the President knows he wants them, and we are willing to participate in that. So the budget process is now well underway. But it took a month's detour, with the commitment that it would allow the time for the President's budget to play out. That has now played out. We now need to get on to the real budgeting that is the responsibility of the Congress. 
I would be happy to let the minority leader comment, if he wishes, before I go on with my discussion on the nuclear waste bill.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, regaining my time, we are certainly going to have ample time to debate the budget and budget issues. But I did think it was important to respond to the minority leader as it relates to his overall statement today and what we have done here in the last month that I think was an effort to accommodate this President. Now it is the job of the Congress to get on with their business, and they will, and those priorities will be well spelled out, and we will continue our efforts toward a balanced budget and a reduced deficit which the President did not honor in his commitment of his new budget, although what the Senator from Nevada has said certainly is a valid statement. The Congress has participated jointly in that.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is now prepared to take up the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. It is time that this Congress clarify its intentions for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste. It is for this reason that I introduced the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996, which passed successfully in this body last year, and it is why I am a sponsor of S. 104 this year. We must resolve the problem that this Nation faces with disposing of nuclear material. Congress must recognize its responsibility to set a clear and definitive nuclear disposal policy. With the passage of this legislation in the last Congress, the Senate expressed its will that Government fulfill its responsibilities. 
One major provision of this legislation directs that an interim storage facility be constructed at Area 25 at the Nevada Test Site and that the interim facility be prepared to accept materials by November 30, 1999. The first phase of this two-phase facility will be of a sufficient size to accept spent fuel from commercial reactors, shut down reactors and the Department of Energy. 
As reported out of Committee, S. 104 includes a provision which I introduced. This provision clarifies Congress' intent to provide for the timely removal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste from the Government's national laboratories and defense programs. Under this provision, the Department of Energy is required to remove Government nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel from our national laboratory sites in an amount equal to at least 5 percent of the total waste DOE accepts into the interim storage facility every year. 
In addition to the billions of dollars that utility ratepayers have contributed to the disposal fund, taxpayers have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to the disposal program for the removal of spent fuel and nuclear waste from the Nation's national laboratory sites. The provision I have sponsored makes good on the Government's commitment to clean up these sites and shows a return on the taxpayer money committed to this disposal program. 
This provision assures that the spent fuel from the U.S. Navy reactors currently stored at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory will begin to be sent to the interim storage facility beginning in 1999. This is good news for both the DOE and for Idaho. Spent nuclear fuel will be moved out of Idaho well before the agreed date of 2035 called for in the agreement between Idaho Governor Batt, the DOE and the Navy. The fuel that is now temporarily stored in Idaho will be at the designated facility designed for long term disposal. 
In my opinion, this legislation is important because it closes off the `escape routes' that exist in past legislation on this issue and have stymied the opening of a facility that actually accepts spent nuclear fuel and stores or disposes of it at a permanent facility. S. 104 closes these escape routes by specifying an interim facility location and a date for the opening of that facility. 
Congress must own up to its responsibilities for the disposal of nuclear materials that it assumed through statute in 1982; a responsibility that 40 utilities and other organizations from 23 States are suing the Federal Government right now in the U.S. Court of Appeals to fulfill. The passage of S. 104 will take a major step in that direction and stem the Government's potential liability for failure to fulfill its contractual commitments--a potential hemorrhage of billions of dollars in judgments against the Department of Energy. By this action, spent nuclear fuel that is currently stored at nearly 100 different sites around the country--sites that were never designed for long-term storage--will be move to one central location: A location that is specially designed for such storage. 
In the course of this debate, we will hear a lot of discussion from those on both sides of this issue about transportation. Those who don't want to address the nuclear waste issue are likely to raise the specter of a `mobile Chernobyl.' This scaremongering is simply not supported by the facts. 
The fact is that there have been over 2,500 commercial shipments of spent fuel in the United States, and that there has not been a single death or injury from the radioactive nature of the cargo. Let me add to these statistics by noting that in my State there have been over 600 shipments of Navy fuel and over 4,000 other shipments of radioactive material. Again, there have been no injuries related to the radioactive nature of these shipments. This is an exemplary safety record--a product of the care and rigorous attention with which these materials are transported. 
I know that many people would prefer not to address the problem of spent nuclear fuel disposal. But for this Congress not to address the problem would be irresponsible. As the legislative body that sets policy for the Nation, Congress cannot sit by and watch while a key component of the energy security of this Nation, and the source of 20 percent of our country's electricity, nuclear power, drowns in its own waste. 
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 will do what neither the 1982 nor the 1987 act accomplished, and that is to definitively resolve the question of what to do with spent nuclear fuel in a timely manner. I look forward to its successful passage.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to speak on `A History of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, 1947-1997.' 
Fifty years ago, the Senate established the Republican and Democratic policy committees. At the end of the Second World War and at the beginning of the cold war, U.S. Senators had concluded that this venerable old institution needed modernization to enable it to handle the increasingly complex foreign and domestic issues on its agenda, and to hold its own against an expanding presidential influence. 
From 1945 to 1946, a joint committee chaired by Senator Robert M. LaFollette, Jr., a Republican from Wisconsin, and Representative Mike Monroney, an Oklahoma Democrat, investigated ways to reform the legislative branch. The joint committee proposed creation of professional staffs for each standing committee and allowing Senators and Representatives to appoint administrative assistants. It also recommended expansion of the Legislative Reference Service, now known as the Congressional Research Service. Those reforms were incorporated into the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. 
One proposal that was not included in the act was the joint committee's recommendation that the Senate and House establish policy committees to assist the parties in promoting their legislative agenda. House Speaker Sam Rayburn feared that such policy committees might 
threaten his authority and refused to support them. Although the idea was dropped from the Legislative Reorganization Act, it was shortly thereafter incorporated in an appropriations bill but authorized policy committees for the Senate alone. Some time later the House also established policy committees. 
Chief credit for the policy committees belongs to Ohio Republican Senator Robert A. Taft. As chairman of the Republican Steering Committee, from 1944 to 1946, Taft firmly believed in thorough preparation and expertise. Although Republicans were then in the minority, Taft used the Steering Committee to plan and coordinate the party's legislative program, rather that wait to react defensively against the initiatives of the President and the majority party. Under Taft the Steering Committee helped Republican Senators become better informed on pending issues. His staff ran evening meetings that some called a night school for Senators. The Republican Steering Committee became the model for the proposed policy committees. Indeed, when the policy committees were written into law, the Republican Conference simply redesignated its Steering Committee as the Republican Policy Committee. Chairman Taft and all of the other members of the Steering Committee become the first members of the Policy Committee. 
The Republican Policy Committee came into existence at the beginning of the 80th Congress, just as Republicans resumed the majority in the Senate and House. The 50th anniversary finds Republicans back in the majority in both Houses of Congress. Over the years the Policy Committee's services and functions have expanded considerably. Since 1947, it has produced the very useful Record Vote Analyses. Since 1956, it has hosted working lunches each week for Republican Senators. Since 1987, it has operated an in-house bulletin-board cable information channel to keep Senators and their staffs apprised of Senate floor activities and the upcoming agenda. In 1995, the Policy Committee stood among the first Senate offices to develop a home page on the Internet's World Wide Web, to provide information inside and outside the Senate on its publications, and to share information on key Republican policies. 
The Policy Committee staff prepares both brief and indepth reports on the major issues facing the Senate. The Policy Committee conducts seminars for new legislative staff members, and holds issue forums and roundtable discussions for Senators. It also hosts regular meetings for staff directors, legislative directors, and press secretaries. 
During its first 50 years, the Republican Policy Committee grew into a thriving operation staffed by a variety of experts. Working directly with the Senators, and educating the journalists who report on them, the Policy Committee has assisted Republican Senators in setting policy, enacting legislation, and getting their message out. That is an accomplishment entirely consistent with the goals that Robert Taft set in founding the Republican Policy Committee. The story of how those goals were achieved is contained in the history of the Policy Committee that was prepared by the Senate Historical Office, and will now be available for Senators, staff, students, and the general public. 
I understand that the Democratic Policy Committee is considering a companion publication, and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate its chairman, Senator Tom Daschle, and cochairman, Senator Harry Reid, on our mutual 50th anniversary.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Indiana for bringing together for us what is a perplexing issue. 
I had watched from afar, because I am not a Member of the Intelligence Committee, the process of the interviewing of the nominee, Tony Lake. While I know there was considerable controversy and an unwillingness on the part of this administration to send forth the full FBI file, that was really the only argument I ever heard. Finally some of that file came, but certainly not all of it did, nor was there ever full disclosure. 
Yet on the evening news last night I watched a very indignant President talking about the corruption of the procedure. And nowhere during all of this did I understand that there was any corruption, only a request for knowledge, for information to decide whether the No. 1 intelligence officer of this country was eligible to serve in that position. 
The Senator from Indiana has told us the rest of the story. And the rest of the story is that Tony Lake is a refugee of this administration's mispractices, if not illegal acts. He is not a refugee of this Congress' failure to act, because we were doing what is our constitutional responsibility. 
I, too, today voted for an independent counsel. Two weeks ago I called for an independent counsel, as I think most of us were growing to believe that anything we did here would be either tainted by the opposition or tainted by the media as somehow a partisan act. 
What the Intelligence Committee of the Senate did was not partisan. It was constitutional. It was responsible. What the President did in his `mea culpa, mea culpa' last night was the first to the altar of the sinners to say `not I' when in fact the stories are now pouring out that somehow the process was corrupted and that Tony Lake, as an instrument of that process, grew corrupt along with it. 
Just because the great Soviet empire and communism as a sweeping rave of `isms' around the world seems to be on the rapid decline, is foreign policy and the integrity of foreign policy in our country any less important? I would suggest that it is not. 
When foreign countries wish to influence the most economically powerful country in the world for purposes of commerce or access to its decisionmaking, that in itself is of concern. And it has to be this Congress that understands that and this President that understands that and in no way allows foreign policy, decisionmaking, or any part of that process to be biased by undue influence. And yet day after day, now almost hourly, the stories pile up. Tony Lake is now part of that story. 
Janet Reno must step aside from what appears to be at this moment a gross conflict of interest and do what is her statutory responsibility, and that is to appoint an independent counsel. Then let the chips fall where they may. And I do not know where they will fall. And I do not think the Senator from Indiana knows. 
We are talking about allegations, allegations that were first launched, not by a politician, but by the media itself. It was an article in the Los Angeles Times back in the latter days of the last campaign that argued that somehow there appeared to be an issue of corruption or an issue of compromise or an issue of illegality as it relates to how this administration, most importantly, this President and his Presidential campaign had raised money. 
Now Janet Reno, do your job. Call the independent counsel. Get on with the business of ferreting out whether there were illegal acts involved in the corruption of or the compromise of this President and this President's foreign policymaking. 
And, thank goodness, through all of the winnowing process Tony Lake is now out of the picture and we can get on with the business of reviewing nominees who can meet the test of integrity and legitimacy in conducting what is still a very important part of this country's affairs, and that is our intelligence-gathering network, the eyes and ears of a government who is responsible for conducting the foreign policy of a nation that still remains critical to the security of our country and our financial and economic well-being. 
I thank my colleague from Indiana for so clearly pointing these issues out. I yield back my time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am proud to join with my colleague from Florida today in the introduction of the Puerto Rico Self-Determination Act. 
In the 104th Congress, I joined as a cosponsor of S. 2019, with a bipartisan effort in the Senate to deal with this issue. I know that some of my colleagues will question the need for Congress to take up this issue. The most common reaction is that we should let Puerto Ricans decide the issue for themselves. The problem with that approach is that there are two parties in that relationship: Congress, due to its constitutional plenary power expressly vested in it by the territorial clause of article IV, section 3, clause 2, on the one hand and the people of Puerto Rico who have U.S. citizenship but are not yet fully self-governing on the other. 
When Congress failed to approve legislation to provide a status resolution process in 1991, the Puerto Ricans conducted a status vote, and the commonwealth option was defined on the ballot in the terms most favorable to its approval, to the point that it promised a lot more than Congress could ever approve. Even with the ballot definition that would significantly enhance the current status, the existing commonwealth relationship received less than a majority of the vote. So there is a serious issue of the legitimacy of the current less-than-equal or less-than-full self-governing status, especially given the U.S. assertion to the United Nations in 1953 that Puerto Rico was on a path toward decolonization. 
That is why the legislature of Puerto Rico passed Concurrent Resolution 2, on January 23, 1997, requesting Congress to sponsor a vote based on definitions it would be willing to consider, if approved by voters. With timely approval of this legislation, 1997 will be the year Congress provides the framework for the resolution of the Puerto Rican status question, through a three-phase decisionmaking process that will culminate during the second decade of the next century. It will be a process with respect to the right of residents of Puerto Rico to become fully self-governing, based on local self-determination, and, at the same time, recognizes that the United States also has a right of self-determination in its relationship to Puerto Rico. 
Consequently, resolution of the status of Puerto Rico should take place in accordance with the terms of a transition plan that is determined by Congress to be in the national interest. Acceptance of such a congressionally approved transition plan by the qualified voters of Puerto Rico in a free and informed act of self-determination will be required before the process leading to change of the present status will commence. 
The bill that I am introducing today, joined in by nine other colleagues, and my colleague from Florida, creates an evenhanded process that can lead to either separate sovereignty or statehood, depending on whether Congress and the residents of Puerto Rico approve the terms of the implementation of either of the two options of full self-government. Preservation of the current status also will be an option on the plebiscite ballot. However, the existing unincorporated territory status, including the commonwealth structure of local government, is not a constitutionally guaranteed form of self-government. Thus, until full self-government is achieved for Puerto Rico, there will be a need for periodic self-determination procedures as provided in this legislation. 
Whichever new status proves acceptable to Congress and the people of Puerto Rico, final implementation of the new status could be subject to approval by Congress and the people of Puerto Rico, at such time in the first or second decade of the next century as a transition process is completed. 
This explanation of the bill should dispel any concern in this body or the House that empowerment of the people of Puerto Rico to exercise the right of self-determination will impair the ability of Congress to work its will regarding the status of Puerto Rico. 
Mr. President, in 1956, 4 years after Congress and the people of Puerto Rico approved the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Supreme Court considered the constitutional nature and status of unincorporated territories such as Puerto Rico. In its opinion in the case of Reid v. Covert (354 U.S. 1), the Supreme Court confirmed that the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution--article IV, section 3, clause 2--confers on Congress the power, in the court's words, `. . . to provide rules and regulations to govern temporarily territories with wholly dissimilar traditions and institutions . . .' 
While the Reid case was not a territorial status decision, it is significant that the Supreme Court's opinion in this case recognizes the temporary nature of the unincorporated territory status defined by the high court in an earlier line of status decisions known as the Insular Cases. For even though Puerto Ricans have had statutory U.S. citizenship since 1917, and local constitutional self-government similar to that of the States since 1952, it has become quite clear that U.S. citizens residing in an unincorporated territory cannot become fully self-governing in the Federal constitutional system on the basis of equality with their fellow citizens residing in the States of the Union. 
Specifically, unincorporated territorial status with the commonwealth structure for local self-government cannot be converted into a permanent form of union with constitutionally guaranteed U.S. citizenship, or equal legal and political rights with citizens in the States including voting rights in national elections and representation in Congress. At the same time, Congress cannot abdicate, divest or dispose of its constitutional authority and responsibility under the territorial clause or be bound by a statutory conferral of special rights intended to make the citizens of a territory whole for the lack of equal rights under the Federal constitution. 
The concept of an unalterable bilateral pact between Congress and the territories is politically implausible and constitutionally impermissible. A mutual consent based relationship would amount to a local veto power over acts of Congress and would give the territories rights and powers superior to those of the States. Indeed, I am not certain what the results would be if the States were given the option of trading in representation in Congress and the vote in Presidential elections for the power to veto Federal law, but it is a prospect inconsistent with American federalism. 
Thus, altering our constitutional system to attempt to accommodate the unincorporated territories in this way would be a disproportionate, inequitable, and politically perverse remedy for the problems the territories are experiencing due to the lack of voting in Federal elections or representation in Congress. 
Moreover, the concept of enhancing a less-than-equal status so that the disenfranchisement of U.S. citizens in the Federal political proces becomes permanent would arrest the process of self-determination and decolonization that began when the local constitution was established by Congress and the voters in the territory in 1952. 
It would reverse the progress that has been made toward full self-government to attempt to transform a temporary territorial status into a permanent one, although that is precisely what has been attempted by some in Puerto Rico for the last 40 years. Some in Congress have facilitated and promoted the fatally flawed notion that Puerto Rico could become a nation within a nation--if only at the level of partisan politics while being careful never to formally accept or commit that it could be constitutionally sustained. 
In reality, Puerto Rico is capable of becoming a State or a separate nation, or of remaining under the territorial clause if that is what the people and Congress prefer. But a decision to retain territorial status must be based on acceptance that this is a temporary status under the territorial clause, which can lead to full self-government 
outside the territorial clause only when Congress and the voters determine to pursue a recognized form of separate nationhood or full incorporation into the Federal political process leading to statehood. 
Thus, the question becomes one of how long can a less-than-equal and non-self-governing status continue now that Puerto Rico has constitutional self-government at the local level and has established institutions and traditions which are based upon, modeled after, and highly compatible with those of the United States? How long is temporary when we consider that Puerto Rico has been within U.S. sovereignty and the U.S. customs territory for a century? 
The proposals in the past that the self-determination process be self-executing may have had the appearance of empowering the people to determine their destiny. However, any attempt to bind Congress and the people to a choice the full effect and implications of which cannot be known at the time the initial choice is made is actually a form of disempowerment. For self-determination to be legitimate it must be informed, and a one-stage binding and self-executing process prevent both parties to the process--Congress and the people--from knowing what it is they are approving. 
Any process which does not enable Congress and the voters to define the options and approve the terms for implementation through a democratic process which involves a response by each party to the freely expressed wishes of the other as part of an orderly self-determination procedure is a formula for stagnation under the status quo. 
That is why the legislation defining a self-determination process for Puerto Rico must be based on the successful process Congress prescribed in 1950 through which the current constitution was approved by Congress and the voters in 1952. That process empowered the people and Congress to approve the process itself, then approve the new relationship defined through the process. 
As explained below, this is the most democratic procedure possible given the complicated dilemma faced by the United States and Puerto Rico. For only when the people express their preference between status options defined in a manner acceptable to Congress can the United States inform the people of the terms under which the preferred option could be accepted by Congress. This would empower the people to then engage in an informed act of self-determination, and it would empower Congress to define the national interest throughout the process. 
In the 104th Congress, S. 2019, was a response to Concurrent Resolution 62, adopted by the Legislature of Puerto Rico on December 14, 1994, and directed to the U.S. Congress, requesting a response to the results of a 1993 plebiscite conducted in Puerto Rico under local law. See, Congressional Record S9555-S9559, August 2, 1996. Like a similar locally managed vote in 1967, the 1993 vote did not resolve the question of Puerto Rico's future status, in large part because of pervasive confusion and misinformation about the legal nature of Puerto Rico's current status. 
The problem of chronic nonproductive debate in Puerto Rico and in Congress with respect to definition of the current status of Puerto Rico, as well as the options for change, is examined carefully in House Report 104-713, part 1, July 26, 1996, pp. 8-23, 29-36. In addition to responding to Resolution 62 by introducing legislation addressing the subject matter of that request by the elected representatives of the residents of Puerto Rico, S. 2019 was intended to complement and support the efforts of a bipartisan group of knowledgeable Members in the House to address the troubling issues raised in House Report 104-713, part 1.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. 
Let me say to the Senator from Arkansas, if our Founding Fathers were here today, they would suggest that Thomas Jefferson was right. They would also have suggested that tinkering with the Constitution gave us the 13th amendment, which abolished slavery. I know the Senator from Arkansas would agree with me that it was a good amendment. He would probably also agree that the 19th amendment, when Congress tinkered with the idea that women should have a right to vote, was the right thing to do. Tinkering, generationally, has produced 27 amendments to our Constitution that, my guess is, the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Idaho would agree were generally the right things to do at those times in our Nation's history. 
Mr. President, I rise in support today of what could become the 28th amendment to our Constitution. Let me thank the leadership that has worked so hard on this. Of course, there is Senator Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; our majority leader, Trent Lott; majority whip, Don Nickles; the President pro tempore; certainly, the Senator from Nevada, Senator Bryan; Senator Graham from Florida; the Senator from Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun. They deserve recognition for bringing this critical issue to the floor. It is not a sunshine amendment. I first helped introduce this in 1982. It will not go away tomorrow. If we fail today, we will be back next year and the next and the next, until the American people gain their wish, which is to convince this Congress, with the power of the Constitution, that we should become fiscally responsible.

Mr. CRAIG. The question of whether Congress should pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is one of the few truly momentous votes facing this country and the Congress today. The decision we face is in a class of votes like that of a declaration of war. The vote this afternoon will be a vote to end a war. 
For more than 28 years, the national debt and the special interest groups that feed off the taxpayers have waged a war against our economy and, most importantly, a brutal war against the integrity of the investment of the senior citizens and the opportunity of our children and our Nation's future. The spoils of that war is a $5.3 trillion debt. That debt fuels inflation and squeezes the senior community that lives on fixed incomes. That debt already depresses wages and living standards of the working families. 
More than one-half of all personal income taxes paid--let me repeat that, Mr. President--more than one-half of all personal income taxes that are paid today go to pay interest on debt alone. 
The costs of unbalanced budgets will be the most oppressive to our children. A child born today will pay nearly $200,000 in additional taxes, not to pay down the debt, but to pay interest on that debt. 
Under today's trends, when a child born today is fully grown and reaches his or her most productive years, not just the Government, but the entire economy could well be in bankruptcy. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office puts it this way: The Federal `debt would exceed levels the economy could reasonably support.' In other words, somehow, a generation from now, we could actually see that generation having to jettison a debt under a declaration of bankruptcy as a nation. That should not be allowed to happen, and this Congress and this Senate this afternoon have an opportunity to make the kind of change that is needed. We can offer to the American people an opportunity for them to debate this issue and, in every State's capital around the Nation, reclaim their authority over their central Government, by placing into the Constitution the restriction and the positive guidelines that this and every Congress must balance its budget. 
Some who vote `no' today may claim that they want a balanced budget, or even a balanced budget amendment. They may use some other amendment as an excuse. But it should be said, and it should be said often, until the vote occurs this afternoon, a `no' vote today is a vote for the status quo, which means a growing Federal debt and a borrow-and-spend policy that has dominated this Government and this Congress for well over 30 years. 
No wonder our former colleague Paul Simon calls it `fiscal child abuse' to continue this binge of borrow-and-spend. 
This is a moral issue. 
The money being borrowed and spent today belongs to our children. They will pay the bill for years of profligate spending. 
Thomas Jefferson said it well:  
The question whether one generation has the right to bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves.

Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair. I thank the senior Senator from Utah for his tremendous leadership on this issue and the hours of debate he has conducted in the Chamber in behalf of the passage of a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution. 
Mr. President, I feel compelled to rise one more time to discuss how the Social Security trust funds would be treated under the balanced budget amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1. 
Unfortunately, day after day, we hear reference made to what the Congressional Research Service supposedly said about this subject. 
It is about time to put these issues to rest, once and for all. 
Therefore, Congressman Charlie Stenholm and I submitted several more questions to CRS. 
We asked CRS to compare, in several areas, the impact of two different kinds of balanced budget amendments: One that excluded Social Security from budget calculations, as several amendments to Senate Joint Resolution 1 would have; and one that counts all Federal spending in the budget, as does Senate Joint Resolution 1 as reported.

<TEXT>
Mr. CRAIG. There are compelling reasons for not excluding Social Security from budget calculations. Some Senators may feel there are good reasons for that exclusion. Some Senators may feel there are good reasons to vote against Senate Joint Resolution 1. 
But this table and the CRS memo it summarizes convincingly show that several of the reasons offered for voting against Senate Joint Resolution 1 simply do not stand up. 
In three key respects, S.J.Res. 1 and the amendments to exclude Social Security, such as the Reid and Dorgan amendments, would operate identically. 
First, neither approach would change the way Social Security surpluses are invested in Treasury bonds. Some have called that raiding the trust funds. But the Social Security Act required that from the start, because Treasury bonds are the safest investment in the world. 
If the Social Security trust funds are being raided today, and if that so-called raiding continued under Senate Joint Resolution 1, then it would also continue under the Dorgan, Reid, and Feinstein amendments. 
Those amendments don't change the law in this area. 
So there's no reason here to vote for those amendments and against Senate Joint Resolution 1. 
Second, consistent with its two previous memos, this new CRS memo confirms again that the following is equally true for both approaches: The Treasury will redeem Treasury bonds held by the Social Security trust funds; the Treasury will repay cash borrowed from the trust funds; and the trust funds will pay out benefits as promised. 
I want to emphasize the consistency of CRS here. 
The February 5 CRS memo was misunderstood and misrepresented. Some continue to make the misstatements today. 
CRS clarified that misunderstanding in a February 12 memo. But the misstatements continue. 
This newer CRS memo makes it clear that, if there were a problem drawing upon Social Security surpluses in the future under Senate Joint Resolution 1--and there is not--then the same problem would exist under the Reid and Dorgan amendments. 
So there's no reason here to vote for those amendments and against Senate Joint Resolution 1. 
Third, neither version would overturn the current law that protects the balances of the Social Security trust funds. 
Under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, there are points of order--a 60-vote point of order in the Senate--against any legislation that would change trust fund outlays or receipts in a way that would erode the balances in the trust funds. 
So there's no reason here to vote for those amendments and against Senate Joint Resolution 1. 
Fourth, in a fourth key area, one version, Senate Joint Resolution 1, would take the current, statutory process of protecting the Social Security balances, and elevate it into the Constitution. 
Senate Joint Resolution 1 prohibits any change that would increase deficits or reduce surpluses--including those in the Social Security trust fund balances. 
The Dorgan, Feinstein, and Reid amendments, by contrast, would allow the Social Security trust funds to run unlimited deficits. 
Whether you have been for or against amendments excluding Social Security from the budget calculations, those amendments did not pass. 
Now, if you really care about Social Security, you will still vote for Senate Joint Resolution 1 on final passage. 
Under the status quo, we will add another $3 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. 
Does anyone think that adding nearly another $3 trillion to the debt is good for Social Security? 
The debt is the threat to Social Security. The debt is the threat to our children and their standard of living. 
Passing the balanced budget amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, is the answer.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, last week several Senators and Representatives held a bipartisan, bicameral press event on the Capitol Grounds. Among other things, we received a letter, signed by more than 250 economists, endorsing the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The letter was put together by the American Legislative Exchange Council, the largest bipartisan individual association of State legislators in the country. 
These economists, from both sides of the political aisle, have signed an open letter to Congress, asking us to approve the balanced budget amendment. Both Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, they have based their support of the balanced budget amendment upon sound reasoning and a concern that America's future will be crippled if Federal deficits are allowed to continue. Among the signatories are James Buchanan, a Nobel laureate in economics, as well as William E. Simon, who served as Secretary of the Treasury from 1974 to 1977. 
The balanced budget amendment is not a partisan issue--it is an economic and moral issue. We need to recognize that through deficit spending we are selfishly spending on ourselves today the earnings that will be confiscated from future generations without their consent or knowledge. 
The balanced budget amendment to the Constitution imposes procedural constraints on the making of budgetary choices. It doesn't take away the power of the Congress to spend or tax. The amendment requires only that the Congress and the Executive spend no more than what they collect on taxes. 
The effects of the balanced budget amendment would be real as well as symbolic. Elected politicians would be forced to act responsibly and make fiscal choices within meaningfully constructed boundaries. Congress would be faced with important decisions regarding the financial fate of programs sooner rather than later. In its simplest terms, the balanced budget amendment amounts to little more than honesty in budgeting. 
It is time to acknowledge that mere statutes that claim to control Federal spending or deficits have failed. It is time to adopt constitutional control through a balanced budget amendment. 
I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the letter that was signed by over 250 economists who believe that Congress must place constitutional restraints on spending.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, recently, the citizens of Idaho, through their elected representatives in the State legislature, called upon the Members of the U.S. Congress to pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. This is further proof that Idahoans are acutely aware of the devastating impact 28 deficits in a row and 36 unbalanced budgets in 37 years have had on our country. 
If asked, the overwhelming majority of Idahoans would say it is not right to saddle every child born today with nearly $200,000 in additional taxes just to pay interest on the national debt. 
Most Idahoans would say it is not right to rob future generations of the opportunity to participate in a vibrant, growing economy. They understand the implications of the Congressional Budget Office's words, that without changes in current tax and spend policies, the Federal `debt would exceed levels the economy could reasonably support.' 
Most Idahoans can see the debt is the threat to Social Security and that no program, no matter how important, can survive the squeeze of increasing interest payments on the debt--$344 billion in fiscal year 1996. 
Idahoans have known for years that balancing the budget would have an immediate positive impact on American families. In 1982 I was encouraged by Idahoans to vote for BBA. If the BBA would have passed then, the national income would be at least 5 percent higher today, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
Idahoans understand passing the BBA would put more than $1,500 a year into the pockets of American families--per DRI-McGraw-Hill, and others. 
The citizens of Idaho are hard working, wise, and astute in their understanding of the need for the BBA. They know you don't need to be clairvoyant to see what the future holds if our current course of fiscal irresponsibility is maintained.

Mr. CRAIG. Idaho is not the only State in the Union with wise citizens who have requested Congress send them a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Yesterday, along with a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives, I accepted a letter delivered by the bipartisan American Legislative Exchange Council in which nearly 600 State legislators from across the country urge Congress to approve a Federal BBA. 
These State representatives have eloquently articulated the momentous nature of, and need for, the BBA. They state that we `will be faced with many historic opportunities to advance the American dream of freedom, opportunity and prosperity. But none will be as significant as enacting and sending to the states for ratification a Constitutional Balanced Budget Amendment.'

Mr. CRAIG. As is pointed out in this letter, congressional passage is just the first step--next, during ratification, in State capitols and coffee shops, the American people would begin one of the greatest debates ever, one of the greatest civics lessons ever, on the size and scope of their Federal Government. 
Mr. President, 70 to 80 percent of Americans are calling on the Congress to pass the BBA and provide them with the opportunity to, once and for all, put our fiscal house in order. It is unconscionable for us to ignore that call. 
The wisdom of our Founding Fathers is evident in the construction of our Constitution. They reached a delicate balance by creating a document strong enough to ultimately hold the States, with all their competing interests, together, yet with a mechanism allowing the flexibility necessary for future generations to deal with the unforeseen circumstances they knew would develop. 
The Constitution of the United States vests the ultimate responsibility to approve or disapprove constitutional amendments with the people, as represented by their elected State legislatures. Mr. President, it is time that Congress tap into the wisdom displayed by Idahoans, the Nation's State legislators, and our country's Founding Fathers by passing Senate Joint Resolution 1 and sending the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to the States for ratification. 
[Exhibit 1 
Legislature of the State of Idaho, Senate Joint Memorial No. 102 
Whereas, the annual federal budget has not been balanced since 1969, and the federal public debt is now more than five trillion dollars, or twenty thousand dollars for every man, woman and child in America; and 
Whereas, continued deficit spending demonstrates an unwillingness or inability of both the federal executive and legislative branches to spend no more than available revenues; and 
Whereas, fiscal irresponsibility at the federal level is lowering our standard of living, destroying jobs, and endangering economic opportunity now and for the next generation; and 
Whereas, the federal government's unlimited ability to borrow raises questions about fundamental principles and responsibilities of government, with potentially profound consequences for the nation and its people, making it an appropriate subject for limitation by the Constitution of the United States; and 
Whereas, the Constitution of the United States vests the ultimate responsibility to approve or disapprove constitutional amendments with the people, as represented by their elected state legislatures; and opposition by a small minority repeatedly has thwarted the will of the people that a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution should be submitted to the states for ratification; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the members of the First Regular Session of the Fifty-fourth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Representatives concurring therein, That the Congress of the United States expeditiously pass, and propose to the legislatures of the several states for ratification, an amendment to the Constitution of the United States requiring, in the absence of a national emergency, that the total of all federal appropriations made by the Congress for any fiscal year may not exceed the total of all estimated federal revenues for that fiscal year; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Congress, the congressional delegation representing the state of Idaho in the Congress of the United States, and to the Secretary of State and the presiding officers of both houses of the Legislatures of each of the other states in the Union. 
[Exhibit 2 
Open Letter From State Legislators to Congress 
Dear Member of Congress: As members of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) we would like to take this opportunity to welcome the 105th Congress. It is both an exciting and challenging time to be an elected official in this great nation. 
During the next few years, you will be faced with many historic opportunities to advance the American dream of freedom, opportunity and prosperity. But none will be as significant as enacting and sending to the states for ratification a Constitutional Balanced Budget Amendment. 
As state legislators who must balance our state budgets each year, we understand the difficult choices you will face. Unfortunately, as the past 29 years have shown, it has been impossible for past Congresses to withstand the political pressure of special interests and make the tough choices necessary to balance the budget. Clearly, the federal budget process is broken and needs fixing. As the experience in the states shows, balanced budget amendments work, and a federal Balanced Budget Amendment is the only way to guarantee the fiscal integrity of this nation and a solvent future for our children and grandchildren. Therefore, we call on you to exercise the courage and fiscal responsibility to stand up to the special interests who are willing to place their interests ahead of the nation's future. 
We hope that the 105th Congress will make the Balanced Budget Amendment its first priority. The nation cannot afford to wait. The federal government cannot continue to borrow from future generations to pay for current consumption. If deficit spending is not curbed now, when it can be done sensibly and gradually, it will have to be done under desperate circumstances. The only way to ensure that programs like Social Security and Medicare are there for us and our children is to set a course of fiscal responsibility today. 
As you may know, ALEC is the nation's largest bipartisan, individual membership association of state legislators, with nearly 3,000 members. ALEC is dedicated to the Jeffersonian principles of individual liberty, limited government and the free enterprise system. We believe that reducing the devastating $5 trillion national debt is central to these principles and critical to the strength of the nation's economy. 
The historic opportunity to provide a brighter, more prosperous future lies in your hands. We in the states are up to the challenge and ready to ratify the Balanced Budget Amendment. This is not about whether you are a Democrat or Republican or a liberal or conservative--this is about what you must do for the future of this great nation. It is up to you to make the right choice for this country, the fiscally responsible choice--pass a Balanced Budget Amendment.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, years ago, we changed our Constitution to assure that never again in this Nation would we have human bondage. We changed our Constitution to allow women to vote. Today, we are asking this Senate to allow the American people to once again change the Constitution to step away from fiscal bondage or the risk of a bankrupt Government, to take off the backs of our children and grandchildren the burdensome, overpowering debt that we are causing them to accumulate. 
Yes, it is time once again that we ask the American people to change their Constitution to require us to balance the budget, to bring fiscal sanity to our Government, and to ensure the stability of this country, its economy, and the American dream for future generations.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have addressed the Senate already on the need for an independent counsel to investigate the growing scandal concerning fundraising. Along those same lines, I recommend to all my colleagues a thoughtful editorial from the Washington Post entitled `The Fund-Raising Fiasco: The Democrats' Problem . . .'.

Mr. CRAIG. In speaking in morning business this morning, I want to express my concern, actually for the first time, on an issue that has been brewing publicly and not so publicly for well over 2 months now. As the Senate struggles to try to develop a mechanism under which we can effectively investigate the alleged wrongdoing at the White House as it relates to Presidential campaign fundraising, the issue gets larger and larger by the day. Yesterday, I finally believed it was time to speak out in relation to the Justice Department appointing independent counsel. I say so because it is obvious to me now that the public does not want the Congress to grind itself into gridlock and partisan fracturing in an effort to do what it should responsibly do, and that is investigate alleged wrongdoing or violations of law on the part of the executive branch. 
Be that as it may, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are also finding themselves in what I believe to now be a most embarrassing situation, having to argue that we probably ought not to do this, or to reduce the scope of what we should legitimately do, all in defense of a President who, by the hour, appears to be increasingly more involved in what is allegedly wrongdoing or violation of Federal campaign law. 
So, yesterday, I asked the Attorney General in a press release to appoint independent counsel and to move ahead with what she and the Justice Department must responsibly and rightfully do. The New York Times editorialized, and they said this: 
Janet Reno's insistence that she is waiting for creditable evidence before appointing an independent counsel has now reached a point of mindlessness. By the standards that applied to the Carter, Reagan, and Bush administrations, the threshold for appointing an independent counsel has been reached and passed. If she will but look, Ms. Reno will see a pervasive pattern of reckless behavior and an array of suspicious incidents that cry out for an independent counsel. 
That editorial went on to say--it speaks of the White House, and it says: 
Presidents and their White House aides are inevitably involved in campaign planning, as certainly U.S. Senators are in the planning of their campaigns. But, by openly bartering Presidential invitations for political contribution and by relentlessly mixing official and political, this administration has gone so far beyond the normal rules of political behavior and the traditional interpretation of Federal law that even so dogged a Democrat as Pat Moynihan. . . . 
And so on and so forth. And it speaks again for Ms. Reno to appoint that independent counsel. 
This morning in the Washington Times, again, headlines, `Reno Not Ready for Outside Probe.' 
My question today is to Ms. Reno. When will you be ready? When there is a massive public outcry of wrongdoing or alleged wrongdoing? When the evidence piles so high at the door of the White House that you cannot step across the threshold to go see your friend, the President, Mr. Clinton? 
Ms. Reno, wake up. Listen to what is being said in public. It is time to act. It is time we develop an independent counsel, bipartisan, nonpartisan, to investigate what is now verging on a major scandal. Someone asked me while I was traveling in Idaho last week, `Why is the President out advocating campaign finance reform when it appears that he is the greatest violator?' I said, `There is an old adage that those who sin the most are the first to the altar.' 
We find it increasingly embarrassing to read in the newspapers everyday that somehow the White House, the very image of this country, was used for personal gain in a way that no other President has used it. 
So, once again, today I call on the Attorney General to do what she must responsibly do. The allegations grow by the day. Ms. Reno, do what you should do. Appoint an independent counsel to investigate, in a nonpartisan way, what should be done, for the sake of the Presidency and the White House itself. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal article entitled `Irate Clinton Blasts Moves for Counsel' be printed in today's Record.

Mr. CRAIG. I thank my colleague from Wyoming for yielding. Let me say at the outset of my comments that I am pleased to join with Senator Graham today in a discussion about an area of the balanced budget amendment that he admits is not necessarily viewed with the kind of critical nature that other parts of the amendment have been. The Senator from Florida has, in a very sincere way, taken a close look at this and tried to offer an alternative that maybe on the outset bears some attractiveness. I was approached by the Senator and in good faith took a detailed look at his amendment, and my reaction in the next few minutes are as follows. 
I do not question the sincerity at all of the Senator from Florida for what he is attempting to do here, to assure that the trust funds of Social Security are held solvent from his perspective and yet to deal with the issue of debt. Our amendment is straightforward. 
Section 1 contains the balanced budget rule, total outlays should not exceed total receipts except by a three-fifths vote. Section 6 allows good-faith use of reasonable estimates in planning a balanced budget. In Senate Joint Resolution 1 the numbers match up. The balanced budget rule and the enforcement of that rule correspond with each other. 
Over the years, as we have worked to refine this amendment, and I must say that the amendment that we have before the Senate has been well over a decade in refinement so that if we enshrine this in the Constitution we believe it will work in a total sense, while I say all of that, section 2 requires a three-fifths vote to increase the limit on debt held by the public. If the Congress balanced the budget every year, the debt held by the public will not increase. That is, in reality, the balanced budget. That is what the public would expect that is what we would accomplish by the language of the amendment. 
Therefore, freezing the limit on debt held by the public directly enforces honest and accurate estimates to produce a balanced budget. That, of course, is another one of our goals, to engage the executive and the legislative branches, the Office of Management and Budget with the Congressional Budget Office and the appropriate budget members to make as accurate as possible the projections that produce the revenue to offset the expenditures. 
The relationship among deficit debt and trust funds is important here and this is the crux of the Graham amendment. Debt held by public is Federal debt owed to debtors outside Government. When an official trust fund runs a surplus, by law it must invest the surplus funds in Treasury securities. For example, the Treasury is required to borrow those funds--money moving inside Government, not outside Government. 
These interagency or intragovernmental borrowings, plus debt held by public, money we borrow from the public with the selling of Treasury notes, is included in gross debt. If the budget is balanced, debt held by public does not change. If the budget is balanced and all trust funds continue to run a surplus, then the gross debt goes up. By the very nature of the money in those surpluses, of those trust funds being loaned to the Government, so the Government general fund, if you will, owes. Therefore, it has debt, debt back to the trust funds. If the budget is balanced and the trust funds run a deficit, the gross debt goes down. That is the frustration of the Graham amendment. 
Under the Graham amendment the numbers, in my opinion, do not match up. The Graham amendment places a section 2 limit on debt held by the public with a limit on gross debt. That is the crux of his amendment, changing public to gross. Congress can only comply with the section 1 balanced budget rule and still be significantly out of compliance with section 2 limits. That creates the schism, if you will, in the amendment to the Constitution, in my opinion, if the Graham amendment were to become a part of it. 
Therefore, if Congress precisely balances the budget, then it must either repeatedly muster a three-fifths vote to allow the trust funds to run a surplus, or to avoid a three-fifths vote on the gross debt limit raid and reduce the trust fund surpluses. That would be the ultimate outcome in my opinion of how Congress would have to react to the Graham amendment if it were to become a part. 
If Congress does not want to reduce the trust fund balance, then it must run large surpluses by cutting spending in the nontrust fund part of the budget or by raising taxes. 
For the years 2002 to 2007, that means up to $435 billion in additional cuts or taxes, in my opinion. Long-term impact of the Graham amendment on debt and deficit would then be as follows. It would be politically difficult for Congress to continually outperform the balanced budget rule in section 1, that is, run large surpluses. It may be much easier to muster the three-fifths vote to increase the gross debt limit and say it is a `technicality,' a `necessity,' to allow trust funds to run a surplus; therefore, there will be upward pressure on debt. 
Senator Graham is right, this is complicated. That is why not a lot of people focus on it. But I disagree with him not only on the frustration of it, but on the outcome of it. Without a section 2 limit on debt held by the public that directly enforces honest and accurate budget estimates, Congress and the President will continue to face political pressure to use the rosy scenario estimates; therefore, it will still be easier to deficit spend. 
One of the things I believe the amendment that we have introduced on the floor forces is as accurate and as honest estimates as you can get, because if, in fact, you produce a deficit, the ability to move that deficit in the debt is a tough vote, and it really forces the fiscal constraints and the tough decisions that we want our balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to cause this Congress to deal with. 
Even if the gross debt limit under the Graham amendment remains frozen at $6.7 trillion, as his chart would suggest, it still leaves room to add an additional $2.9 trillion to debt held by the public between the years 2019 and 2029. 
My argument is simply this, Mr. President, and I will take the Graham chart and simply extend the line, because this is discretionary on the part of the Congress. It is arguable, by his figures, that there is a decline, but the ceiling remains upward. I know the Congress, and I think Senator Graham knows the Congress. If they have room to spend, oh, boy, do they love to spend. That $2.9 trillion gives them that opportunity, to actually increase real debt. So what would happen down here in debt held by the public, potentially, under this? This line turns upward. This category of debt held by the public versus the green category, which is debt held by other trusts, and the red, of course, is the Social Security trust funds, that line begins to move up. 
In the year 2029, the Graham amendment allows a $6.7 trillion debt, while our amendment as proposed, Senate Joint Resolution 1, allows a $5.8 trillion debt--almost a trillion dollars less. I figure that a trillion dollars is a lot of money, especially when it's borrowed, it's debt, and you are paying interest on it. That is one of the great frustrations we are dealing with today --that finally debt has caught up with us. We used to argue that debt was a good stimulus to the economy and, oh, well, the public owed it to themselves, it was no big deal. But, today, it is the second largest item in the Federal budget, soon to shove them all out if we continue this kind of debt creation under deficit spending. 
This is why I have to oppose the Graham amendment, because I don't believe that it gets us to where we want to go. I think I now understand what the Senator from Florida tries to do, and it is not a criticism of what he tries to do; it is an observation of what he tries to do. Where I think its weaknesses rest--because, if you talk gross debt but you don't talk debt held by the public, it changes the whole dynamics of the process, as I understand it, and in this outyear period. Somebody might say, `Senator Craig, why are you worried about 2029?' We are talking about the 28th amendment to the Constitution. We are talking about a process that we have been well over a decade in trying to create, and it will not be changed easily, or overnight, if it is in error or if the Graham amendment were to become part of it and then we were to find it creates this kind of glitch. We would struggle for decades trying to solve that, with the potential of increasing the debt structure by well over a trillion dollars. The last I checked, interest on a debt of a trillion dollars is significant--probably around $50 billion a year. 
That is the reality of the amendment, as I see it, and certainly I stand to be corrected. Of course, he knows his amendment a great deal better than I. I tried to study it because I knew the Senator was sincere in his effort to deal with this in a legitimate way and at the same time recognize, as we all want to recognize, the protection of the trust funds, which now help finance the debt structure of this country. 
I believe, if you keep it within the unified budget, if you recognize all debt, then you create the kind of honesty that you must play with in a sincere and direct way and force both the executive branch of our Government and the legislative branch of our Government, in each and every budget cycle, to produce the kind of honest estimates that drive the budget process to produce actual spending at or near balance on an annualized basis. 
With those comments, I stand in opposition to the Graham amendment and certainly urge my colleagues to oppose it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair. 
I will not take much more time to discuss the Graham amendment other than the disagreement that he and I might have as relates to the ceiling that is created, and while I would argue that what he wishes to accomplish is impossible to do, and that is a buy down of debt, unless by this whole character of activity here from now until the year 2019 we have changed the whole culture of political pressure in this country and interest group activity, my guess is that the pressure to spend money, if the system would allow it, beyond the balance because of the limit on the debt ceiling, would be great. 
He and I recognize the tremendously laudable goal of trying to buy down debt, and I think Americans are all asking us, well, if you in fact can get the budget balanced in the timeframe that you are suggesting, does that mean then we are going to get rid of some of this debt, because interest on debt is going to be even higher by the year 2002 than it is today because we are still creating debt. Even under our scenario, as conservative as it is and as damning as this administration thinks it is, we are still going to be creating lots of debt out there because we are still deficit spending. Although ours is declining and the President's is in reality increasing, we are still creating debt. So I do not blame the Senator from Florida for wanting to find a time in which we can buy down debt. I would like to do the same. But his is not an obligation to do that; his is only an opportunity to do that. And therein lies the difference in why I think what we do today is the right thing by not amending the proposed amendment. 
Social Security is a concern of all of ours and it has been, and you have heard a lot of debate in the Chamber in the last 3 weeks about Social Security. It is a social contract and a financial obligation that we hold to the senior citizens of our country. None of us want to deny it or walk away from it. We want to deal with it responsibly and straightforward and we want to create the fiscal environment in which we can honor that debt. 
I am one of those who believes that if we fail to balance the budget, there will come a day when we cannot honor that debt. We should not suffer the illusion that a bankrupt government can send checks out. Tragically enough, there are some Social Security recipients who believe that somehow they will be held whole while the rest of the world collapses, the world of a Government that is so badly in debt that it cannot honor its commitments or, more importantly, at a time when the public would simply reject it. 
Gross interest payments this year reached $344 billion, fiscal year 1996. The debt grows, the mandatory interest payments grow. Here are the figures. Social Security, we spent $347 billion on Social Security this year; gross interest on debt, $344 billion; defense, $266 billion; all the domestic discretionary programs, $248 billion; Medicare, $191 billion; Medicaid, $92 billion; net interest on debt held by public, a subset of gross interest or gross debt, the kind that the Senator from Florida was talking about, $241 billion. 
The reality of what we do is damning the future of this country, damning the future of the obligations we hold to the seniors of our communities if we fail in balancing the budget. 
The President, I believe, 12 times in his State of the Union said he was going to produce a balanced budget, and we all held our breath and did not criticize and waited for that budget to come to the Hill. And, voila, the words did not meet the fine print--$120 billion of deficit straight lined 
until the end of his term and then, guess what? He leaves office and says: Now it is time to do the heavy lifting. You either have to take away the tax cuts I have given or cut spending dramatically. 
I am sorry, Mr. President. Once again your rhetoric just does not match up to your performance, and that budget does not work, and you have not dealt with a balanced budget in the honest and straightforward way that the Senator from Florida or the Senator from Idaho or the majority of Congress or a supermajority of the American people want us to deal with it. And that is a declining deficit structure to the year 2002 when all of this comes into balance. 
The reality of the obligation to Social Security does not go away, but the honesty of budgeting materializes, and because we have created a unified budget the real pressure to cut so that we can honor the debt obligation to Social Security is there. We must get our fiscal house in order. We cannot, nor should we ever, allow interest on gross debt to become the greatest single expenditure in the Federal budget, and yet we are clearly headed in that direction. By most reasonable budget guesstimates we have missed that by only $3 billion this year. 
I know what any good business person or any good analyst of a business would say if the figures were like this in a business. They would say you are out of business; you are bankrupt; you cannot service your debt; you cannot afford to operate in this manner. However, because we can create debt in the nature that we have now for nearly 30 years, we continue. Of course, that obligation gets immediately transferred outward into the future to our children, to our grandchildren, and somehow we are fair weather; we just go on saying we have done our job in a responsible way. 
I was saddened yesterday that the Senator from New Jersey would not honor his obligation and his verbal commitment to the citizens of his State. That is a tragedy, but he has made his choice. We all make our choices. Those are tough choices. The pressures are great here, but they are not so great as to walk away from your commitment to your citizens, to your public and to the oath of office. What we are trying to do is enshrine within the Constitution an obligation that Thomas Jefferson was so very clear about when he said there should have been an 11th amendment to the Bill of Rights and that was that we could not borrow. Now, we could have borrowed inside the budget but we could not borrow from outside the budget. 
What we are suggesting is that we cannot borrow from outside the budget. We can borrow from inside the budget, and that is what we are doing now, and that is the unified budget. It does not make the obligation go away. It does not make the legal commitment go away. It does not say to the baby boomers that, when you get ready to retire your check won't be in the mail. What says to the baby boomers that your check may be threatened and may someday not be in the mail is the perpetual increase of debt, that which the Senator from Wyoming pointed out a few moments ago with all of those books stacked before him. It is one budget piled upon another budget piled upon another budget. 
Regarding half of those 28, half of those 28 budgets, the politicians who assembled them, interestingly enough, had the public tenacity to say they are heading toward balance. For 3 years we have been saying we are headed toward balance. The President's State of the Union Address before the American people assembled: `I will produce balanced budgets.' Oh, come on, Mr. President. We have read the fine print. You do not produce a balanced budget and you are not trying. You raise taxes, you raise revenue, you spend more for new programs, and after you have left office you say, `Now, if you want to get it balanced, you either raise taxes or you cut spending.' Big-time stuff, $50-billion, $60-billion-type stuff--tough to do. Most important, he knows it's impossible to do. It is impossible to do unless Senate Joint Resolution 1 is the organic law of the land. 
It is the Constitution through which the public views its Government and controls its Government and tells its Government what to do. That is the test before us. 
While the Senator from Florida in a responsible way attempts to address that, I ask that we reject his amendment because of the risk of increasing debt by at least another $1 trillion or more inside what we could definitionally call a balanced budget. We dare not do that to our public. Most important, we dare not allow that kind of latitude in future Congresses. I am not going to be here then. The Senator from Florida is not going to be here then. But his action, my action, the action of this Senate, whether it is on Senate Joint Resolution 1 amended by the Senator from Florida, or if it is left as it is presented, will be the law of the land that dictates to the Congress and to the Senate in the year 2019 or 2028: This is how you operate. These are the parameters within which you must perform, in which you must make priorities for spending. It must be balanced, it must be honest, it must be fair. 
What we do here is going to be important both in the short term and in the long term. What we do must be honest and must be clear and undefinitional to future Congresses so, just like the first amendment or the second or the third, they are not arbitrary, they are not capricious, they do not create those kinds of actions. They are real and we honor them. So our language must be clear and unambiguous. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join us in opposing the amendment by the Senator from Florida. I do not believe it creates the environment in which we must operate. I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment points to a problem that doesn't exist and then solves it with a loophole. 
Why are we debating the balanced budget amendment in the first place? Because past Congresses have built up a national debt of more than $5.3 trillion, in an abuse of their power of the purse. 
So what does the Kennedy amendment prescribe? It says, let's put the fox in charge of the henhouse. It says Congress doesn't have to comply with this amendment unless it wants to. It says, if Congress says it is complying with this amendment, then no one else can question that. 
I do believe Members of Congress take their constitutional responsibilities seriously. I do believe that most Members really would prefer balanced budgets to running up another $5 trillion in debt. But I don't believe that every particle of every possibility of independent review should be removed from this amendment. 
We will win the war against debt, the war for our economic future the same way we won the cold war: Not by fighting, but by being strong enough to deter. We need to defeat the Kennedy amendment to keep the balanced budget amendment strong enough to deter future fiscal abuse. 
Senator Hatch has spoken eloquently about the legal precedents and judicial doctrines that demonstrate there will not be a problem with judicial activism under Senate Joint Resolution 1. I will only touch on the broadest of those. 
In our Constitution today, we have something called separation of powers among the three branches of government. 
It already gives Congress exclusive power of the purse, saying, `No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law. * * * ' Only the Congress can make law; only the Congress can decide how to spend money. 
It already gives Congress exclusive power to tax. It says, `All bills to raise revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives. * * *' 
Only the Congress can tax, founded upon the Revolutionary War principle of `No taxation without representation.' 
It already gives Congress the power to limit the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, in article III of the Constitution. 
It already gives Congress the power to limit, by law, what budgetary actions the President can take, as it did in the Impoundment Control and Budget Act of 1976, as it did in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, and as it did in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. 
The balanced budget amendment does not in any way change the current balance of power among the three branches of Government. It does not grant the courts or the President any power they don't already have. 
To clarify the matter, the amendment already says, in section 6, `The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation. * * *' 
But, in some very limited cases, the possibility of outside review should be left open. For example: 
Under our Constitution, the courts have already addressed the issue of whether a bill that originated in the Senate, and had the incidental effect of increasing revenues, should have originated in the House. 
Similarly, under Senate Joint Resolution 1, if the Congress passed a bill to increase taxes by voice vote, instead of a majority of the whole number on a rollcall vote, and claimed the bill would not raise taxes, it is fair and reasonable for the Supreme Court to say, no, that bill is unconstitutional, and it is struck down. 
Under Senate Joint Resolution 1, let's say some future Congress set up a shell game to get around the 3/5 vote on the debt limit. Perhaps they could set up a super Fannie Mae that borrows from the public, and then lends to the Treasury. It is fair and reasonable for the Supreme Court to say, no, that is an obvious attempt to subvert the Constitution, and it is struck down. 
In no case, under this amendment, would--or could--the courts rewrite the details of a budget or order a tax increase. They simply couldn't, period. 
But the courts could do what they do today: 
If a case is obvious, if a party has specific standing, if a controversy is justiciable, and if the political question doctrine does not apply--  
Then the Court could look at an act of Congress, or an action of the Executive, and say, no, that violates the Constitution. Stop. Do not pass `Go'. Do not collect $200 billion. Start over again. 
In short, the rule has been, ought to be, that the Court can simply say what the law is, not make new law. 
Some may raise the specter of the Missouri versus Jenkins court case. But that case, however dubious on its own merits, has nothing in common with the arguments being raised here. 
In that case, a Federal court ordered a local school district to raise revenues to pay for a federally mandated desegregation plan. 
In other words, the Federal court was ordering someone else to comply with Federal law. 
That case had nothing to do with Congress, with Federal taxes or with constitutional separation of powers. 
Finally, the Kennedy amendment would only feed public cynicism. 
When the Senate adopted a less sweeping limitation on judicial review in the last Congress, the Nunn amendment, I heard from Idahoans who felt that that amendment had put the fox in charge of the henhouse. 
People will realize that the Kennedy amendment says, the same branch of government that has run up $5.3 trillion in debt should be the sole arbiter of what does, and what does not, comply with a rule against running up another $5 trillion. 
The Kennedy amendment is being offered by opponents of the balanced budget amendment, not to improve it, but in an attempt to kill it. The amendment should be defeated.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, Public Law 94-199, designating the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, was signed into law December 31, 1975. 
Section 10 of the act recognizes that the use of both motorized and nonmotorized river craft are valid activities on the Snake River within the recreation area. 
The language seems clear. However, assurances by the Congress and the Forest Service 22 years ago that the long-established and traditional use of motorized river craft would be continued are now being callously disregarded by the agency. 
The most recent indication of this attitude has arisen during a review and revision of the river management plan for the NRA. Despite the lack of any demonstrable resource problems, and in the face of overwhelming public support for motorized river craft, the agency has again decided to close part of the river to powerboats. The new river management plan would close the heart of the canyon to motorized river craft for 21 days during the peak of the recreation season. Such a closure would also prohibit traditional motor use of the wild river segment to reach privately-owned lands within the scenic river segment of the NRA. 
The revised management plan is still in dispute as the result of appeals filed by commercial motorized river users. The vast majority of people, over 80 percent, who recreate in the Hells Canyon segment of the Snake River do so by motorized river craft. Some are private boaters, but most travel with commercial guides on scenic tours. This popular form of recreation is accomplished with a minimum of impact to the river, the land or other resources. 
Most river users, motorized and non-motorized, are willing to share the river. However, a small group of non-motorized users objects to seeing powered craft even though they have a rich choice of nonmotorized alternatives in this geographic area, such as the Selway and Middle Fork of the Salmon Rivers. Motorized users, however, don't have that luxury. The only other white water rivers open to them in the entire Wild and Scenic River System are portions of the Rogue and Salmon Rivers. Without a single doubt, the Hells Canyon portion of the Snake River is our Nation's premier whitewater power boating river. 
Mr. President, the Snake River is different from most rivers in the Wild and Scenic System. It is a high-volume river with a long and colorful history of use by motorized river craft. The first paying passengers to traverse its rapids on a motor boat made their journey on the 110-foot Colonel Wright in 1865. Later, the 136-foot Shoshone made its plunge through the canyon from Boise to Lewiston in 1870 and was followed by the 165-foot Norma in 1895. Gasoline-powered craft began hauling people, produce, and supplies in and out of the canyon in 1910, and the first contract for regular mail delivery was signed in 1919, continuing today. The Corps of Engineers began blasting rocks and improving channels in 1903. They worked continuously until 1975 to make the river safer for navigation. 
Mr. President, as you can see, the use of motorized river craft is deeply interwoven in the history, traditions, and culture of Hells Canyon. That is why Congress deliberately created a non-wilderness corridor for the entire length of the river in the authorizing legislation. During debate, Congress tried to make it clear that use of both motorized and nonmotorized river craft would be valid uses of the river within the recreation area--the entire river for the entire year. It was not their intent in 1975 to allow the managing agency to decide that one valid use would prevail to the exclusive use over the other. 
Quite clearly, the issue of power boating's validity will not be settled unless decided by the courts or unless Public Law 94-199 is clarified by Congress. The courts are already burdened by too many cases of this type, resulting in a waste of time, energy, and financial resources for both the United States and its citizens. The only practical and permanent resolution of this issue is to clarify congressional intent in a manner that will not allow any future misunderstanding. This is what I propose to do with this legislation.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Iowa for the tremendously important statement he has made. I am amazed at what I think many of us would call gimmickry when it comes to the legitimate and responsible debate over the balanced budget amendment to our Constitution. There is not a Senator on this floor who is not committed to upholding the fiscal integrity and the solvency of the Social Security system of our country. Many of us have voted to do that time and time again, and those votes have produced, in fact, a strong, stable, and secure system to ensure supplemental income for the senior community of our country. But that does not deny us the responsibility of being fiscally responsible. 
The amendment of my colleague from Nevada, while I believe he is sincere, is frustrating to me and at times angry, that it appears at this moment, by press conferences recently held, that there is an effort to game this issue, much like the administration attempted to game Medicare in the last election, when this Congress was legitimately and responsibly involved in trying to save and secure our Medicare system, a system that provides a critical need for the senior community of our country. 
There is absolutely nothing, in my opinion, in the years I have studied the balanced budget amendment to our Constitution, and I find myself reasonably knowledgeable as it relates to the budget itself, that you should separate any portion of the budget from its responsibility of being balanced under a unified budget. 
The week before last, prior to the recess, we saw many of our colleagues on the other side of this issue rush to the floor, claiming that the Congressional Research Service memo confirmed their argument and confirmed their logic that somehow Social Security had to be removed from this amendment, or this proposed amendment. The Congressional Research Service came back with these words: `We have been and are being misrepresented in what we believe to be our findings of the facts and our interpretation.' 
If this is so, then there is reason to be frustrated and there is reason to be a little angry that some would game the system, actually attempting, in my opinion, to distort what is, in fact, the representation of the Congressional Research Service. While I at times have taken legitimate criticism directed toward the Congressional Research Service, I have not tried to say what they said is not what they said that somebody else said. That, of course, is part of the argument that some are using now with the issue of Social Security. 
Oh, it is a way out and it is a way to hide. It is a way to hide from the legitimate vote, up or down, on a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. Why should you be frightened of it? If you are not for a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution, vote no. If you really do not believe in it, vote no. 
If you believe in deficit spending, vote no. But don't try the gimmickry that we have seen. I will repeat the use of that word. We have seen a multitude of amendments come to the floor, and if each one of them had been attached to the constitutional amendment, three-quarters of the Federal budget would be off-budget again, outside of a balanced budget amendment, and able to run free and in deficit for any length of time the Congress so chose. I don't believe that is the intent of the Congress itself. 
I do believe we are listening to the American people at this moment. And, again, the President eloquently, and I believe 12 or 13 times, in his State of the Union Address, said he was sending up a balanced budget. We all, quietly, appropriately, and respectfully, waited for his budget to come to the Hill. We got it, but I must say that it is not in balance. It is a $120 billion deficit across the board. Yet, he calls that balanced. 
Mr. President, get a new set of glasses. I know you are getting to be middle-aged. You better get bifocals because the fine print says that isn't what you are saying. Of course, after he leaves office, then the tough cuts are made to argue his point of a balanced budget, or the tax relief he has proposed would simply be taken away. 
Social Security deserves to be a legitimate and responsible part of the total budget. This job I hold, to which I have sworn an oath of office, also makes me a member of the board of directors of the Social Security system, in essence. The Senator from Nevada and I are dedicated to the long-term stability of the Social Security system. Taking it off budget, allowing it to run deficits, disallowing its responsible and reasonable management through the budget process, does not make a lot of sense. I don't argue separate accounting, I don't argue the legitimate approach that shows or demonstrates to the Social Security recipients what is legitimately his or hers. That is all right and responsible, and we can agree on that. But I suggest that the amendment before us is subterfuge, that it does not resolve the problem. 
Social Security officials have continually said, `How do you save Social Security?' You balance the budget. A bankrupt Government is not going to write a check to anybody in any way. It is a Government who is fiscally responsible, a Government whose budgets are balanced, that can write Social Security checks. It is not independent of any portion of the Federal Government, and it must be taken in the whole of the context of that Government. 
I am disappointed to have to address what are blatant scare tactics that some groups are using on the balanced budget amendment and Social Security. 
Recently, we were hit with a press item that claimed the Congressional Research Service had issued a memo confirming a so-called study by an outside advocacy group--the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities--concerning Social Security and the balanced budget amendment. 
This group has always opposed the balanced budget amendment and consistently opposed reducing the deficit with meaningful domestic spending restraint. 
I say I am disappointed, but I am also angry. I hate to say it, but what CRS actually said has been misrepresented. I have not read everyone's press releases, so I simply assume it was that outside group that was overreaching. 
CRS did not endorse any study or paper by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. CRS did not reach the same conclusion that the balanced budget amendment would in any way impair drawing down the Social Security trust fund surpluses to pay promised benefits when the time came. 
We've all heard the term `G-I-G-O--garbage in, garbage out.' CRS apparently was handed a narrowly written request. They responded, appropriately, with a technically precise memo on February 5. Others released that memo to the press on February 12. 
Part of what CFR said was misrepresented and part was left out. 
The CRS memo was about accounting. It was about what would and would not be included in the calculations of a budget deficit, surplus, or balance under Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
But the spin from opponents of the balanced budget amendment was that the amendment might cause some Social Security checks to be held up. 
The two things have absolutely nothing to do with each other. But the original CRS memo was written in technical language. That made it easy for someone to fabricate a scare story about what it meant. 
On February 12, CRS issued a clarifying memo, also technically precise. They told my staff that, clearly, there was what they charitably called `a misunderstanding.' 
First of all, let's be clear: The first CRS memo talks about the year 2019 and after. Curiously, I have not seen much about that date, 22 years from now, in press reports. We might be tempted to think the intent was to scare today's senior citizens about their Social Security. 
Now, what happens in the year 2019? Social Security outlays are projected to start exceeding receipts. Under the balanced budget amendment, the rest of the Government would have to run a surplus to make sure the overall budget is balanced. 
That is good--it means that, in the long run, assuming for the moment no other reforms are made in the meantime, the balanced budget amendment would make sure we do not abandon our commitment to Social Security beneficiaries. 
The real balanced budget amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, requires us to make sure that a non-Social Security surplus covers any Social Security deficit in the future. That is good for seniors, good for Social Security, and good for the economy. 
So, it all sounds like scare tactics to me. When you are losing on substance, terrorize the senior citizens. 
Let us look at what CRS really said: In its original February 5 memo, CRS said, `(T)his does not mean that Social Security benefits could not be paid, if the rest of receipts into the Treasury for a particular year exceed outlays, this amount could be used to offset the Social Security deficit.' 
Well, this is exactly what our balanced budget amendment requires--that those other, non-Social Security accounts run a surplus. That would protect seniors. 
The February 5, CRS memo continues, `And of course, tax or expenditure provisions, or both, could be altered to create a new balance.' Well, that's exactly what the President's Advisory Council, and the minority leader, and others have talked about. 
Those are the parts of the original CRS memo that get left out when balanced budget amendment opponents quote that memo. 
Now, let us look at the February 12, CRS memo:  
We are not (CRS emphasizes `not') concluding that the Trust Funds surpluses could not be drawn down to pay beneficiaries. The BBA would not require that result. . . . 
Only if no other receipts in any particular year could be found would the possibility of a limitation on drawing down the Trust Funds arise. 
In other words, if the Federal Government was otherwise totally broke would this possibility arise. 
And of course, we know the way to prevent the Government from going totally broke: Pass the balanced budget amendment. 
It has been said here on the floor that CRS did not change its original position. That is right. Its original position has been misunderstood and misrepresented. 
I see my colleague from Texas has arrived, and I believe he has the time until 12:30 under a unanimous-consent request. My guess is if his comments extend beyond that, he can find the cooperation of some of our colleagues here on the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I will state the schedule of today's session. 
This morning, there will be a period of morning business until the hour of 11 a.m. At 11 a.m. the Senate will resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. Under the order, Senator Byrd will be recognized immediately to make a statement regarding the resolution. At the hour of 1:30 today, under a previous consent order, the Senate will resume debate on the pending amendment relating to national security, which was offered by Senator Dodd. Debate on that amendment will be equally divided until 5:30 today, at which time the Senate will proceed to a vote on or in relation to Senator Dodd's amendment. 
Once again, all Senators can expect a rollcall vote at approximately 5:30 today. Additional votes can be expected during today's session on any further amendments that may be ordered to Senate Joint Resolution 1, or, perhaps, on any available nominations, as well as on one or two Senate resolutions, which we are attempting to clear for consideration. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. CRAIG. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. President, the Dodd amendment is more loophole than law. 
Whatever the Senator's intentions, this amendment actually would put a two-step loophole in the balanced budget amendment and in the Constitution: 
Step one: Declare a military threat with a simple majority; 
Step two: Deficit spend as much as you want, on whatever you want. 
That's it. The plain words of this amendment actually do nothing to help military preparedness.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing on behalf of myself and my cosponsors Senators Bryan, Cochran, and Bennett, a bill to reauthorize the highly successful National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992. The act established a cooperative geologic mapping program among the U.S. Geological Survey, State geological surveys, and geological programs at institutions of higher education in the United States. The goal of this program is to accelerate and improve the efficiency of detailed geologic mapping of critical areas in the Nation by coordinating and using the combined talents of the three participating groups. 
Detailed geologic mapping is an indispensable source of information for a broad range of societal activities and benefits, including the delineation and protection of sources of safe drinking water; assessments of coal, petroleum, natural gas, construction materials, metals, and other natural resources; understanding the physical and biological interactions that define ecosystems, and that control, and are a measure of environmental health; identification and mitigation of natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, subsidence, and other ground failures; and many other resource and land-use planning requirements. 
Only about 20 percent of the Nation is mapped at a scale adequate to meet these critical needs. Additional high-priority areas for detailed geologic mapping have been identified at State level by State-map advisory committees, and include Federal, State, and local needs and priorities. 
Funding for the program has been incorporated in the budget of the U.S. Geological Survey. State geological surveys and university participants receive funding from the program through a competitive proposal process that requires 1:1 matching funds from the applicant. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me to ensure the continued efficient collection and availability of this fundamental earth-science information.

Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Alaska, for making a very clear statement of what happens when a country creates the kind of debt which our country has over the last 30 years and the kind of priorities we have to shift to in funding simply to service debt. 
The Senator from Alaska talked about the impact of interest on debt. Standing here or sitting here or stacked here beside me are 28 budgets, 28 consecutive budgets of the last 28 fiscal years of our Government that have been out of balance. In other words, that have had deficits that got spun into debt that have created the $5.3 trillion debt we have today. 
As a result of that, in the last fiscal cycle and the one we are currently in and the one we are currently examining, this Senate and the Congress at large is going to have to consider outlays of upwards of $250 billion to $260 billion to pay the interest on this stack of books or, more clearly spoken, on the debt that was generated by the budgets that are housed in this stack of budgets. 
Of these 28 budgets, 14 of them were intended to be deficit budgets, with no excuse or no apology on the part of the Congress that passed them. But there were the other 14 you would find in the language of the book that would suggest the intent was to balance in the future, or it was designed as a sequence of budgets to balance. 
Interestingly enough, that is the very debate this Congress and our President are involved in at this moment. In fact, the President was here today in the President's Room just behind the Chamber discussing his budget proposal and the leaders of our Senate were there along with the leaders of the House comparing notes and deciding where they might work together to bridge the gap of the kind of impasse we have had and get to a balanced budget. But it is not a balanced budget. It is one budget of a series of budgets that promises to bring balance by a given time, in this case by the year 2002, as did 14 of these budgets. 
Mr. President, 28 years later, 14 budgets in deficit and 14 intended to be balanced, we now are faced with the circumstance the Senator from Alaska has spoken about, a $5.3 trillion debt, $250 to $260 billion of interest paid on debt depending on the rate of interest and the amount our notes are negotiated under, under the 3-year cycle under which our notes get renegotiated, and here is the rest of the story. 
The President, and I do not question his sincerity, presents a budget for fiscal year 1998, of the U.S. Government, that will have about 250 billion dollars' worth of net interest costs, which is about 14.8 percent of the entire Federal budget. Here is what happens in a Government like ours when we have to commit such a phenomenal amount of our resource to interest on debt. Let me give these comparatives. This is work that has been done by our policy committee as an examination of reality because, when we talk about 250 billion dollars' worth of interest on debt, to serve debt, that means that creditors, people who buy our bonds, are owed money. A fair amount of that flows to foreign countries and foreign interest, but a fair amount of it flows to our own citizens and to their stocks and to their trust accounts. 
But 250 billion dollars' worth of net interest in the President's 1998 fiscal budget is something like this. It is 21 times as much on interest as we are spending on agricultural programs. In other words, our priority in budgeting today is to spend 21 times more on interest than we do on agriculture. So our priority is not agriculture, it is paying our debt. Better spoken, I should say paying our creditors who have loaned us their money to service the debt. 
What about international affairs? We are the last great superpower of the cold war period. We play an important role in the decisions of the world and our presence oftentimes causes other nations to think differently about how they would conduct their business, both internally and externally. Yet, today, 17 times as much on interest is paid as on international affairs. So, for those of our constituents who say you are spending too much on foreign aid, I would say we are spending 17 times more on debt, interest on debt. Again, clearly spelling out the priorities that we have forced ourselves into as a great nation, simply because we could not control our spending appetite. 
We pay 11 times as much on interest as on natural resources and the environment. This President, this administration, likes to call itself the environmental administration. And there is not a Senator on this floor who does not want to make sure that Government policy in cooperation with the private sector promotes a positive, cleaner environment. And yet, today, when it comes to priorities of dollars and cents, we pay 11 times more to service the debt created by these 28 budgets as we do on interest rates. Where are our priorities? They are to pay our creditors so we can continue to have debt. 
We spend 10 times as much on interest as on the administration of justice. That is the Justice Department, that is the FBI, that is our engagement in the war on drugs, that is trying to curtail illicit activities that flow across our borders that somehow damage our citizenry. Yet, if you looked at our budget today, you would say that Congress is more preoccupied with paying interest on debt than they are with protecting our citizens against drugs, if you were to look at the actual expenditure of money. Why? Because 30 years worth of fiscal irresponsibilities have forced us to pay more attention to servicing our debt than the flow of drugs across our borders and the kind of impact they have on our citizens and our children. 
We pay six times as much on interest as on benefits and services for veterans. A very large veterans group is now visiting our community, this Nation's Capitol. I was just visited by a nice contingent of Veterans of Foreign Wars. This evening, there is a large gathering of hundreds of Veterans of Foreign Wars in this city, men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our freedom. Many of them are concerned about the future of the Veterans Administration and the veterans health care delivery system, and will we honor our commitment to them and to the World War II veterans who are now reaching a peak in their need for health care services? Yet, today, this Government, by the nature of its fiscal irresponsibility of the last 28 years, is going to pay six times more on interest as on the benefits and services to veterans. Is it our priority? It has to be our priority if we are to maintain our fiscal solvency as a nation. We must progressively ignore the true interests and priorities of our country in light of paying our creditors. 
Four times as much on interest as on education, training, and employment programs; yet our President, in his State of the Union, just this past week prioritized for our Nation and for the decade ahead the issue of our involvement in education at all levels. None of us disputes that priority. All of us recognize that our public schools are in need and, in many instances, they are failing. Yet, today, as we wrestle with the 1998 budget, what will be the first priority? Funding interest on debt created by irresponsible Congresses of the past that generated 5.3 trillion dollars' worth of debt. So where in all of these 
priorities will education fall? It is not going to be first. It cannot be first. What is first? Paying interest on debt. It has to be taken right off the top. It has to be taken right off the top of Government expenditures, just the way interest on serving the debt in the private sector is taken right off the top of all the money coming in. Because if you do not take it off the top, and you do not pay your debts or your interest on debts, if you do not service your debt you do not borrow any money. You are busted. You are bankrupt. And that, of course, is exactly what has happened to this country. 
Now, nearing the largest single item in the Federal budget is interest on debt. So when our colleagues stand on the floor and say, as the President said the other night, `Oh, gee whiz, you guys have the votes and I have the signature. You pass a balanced budget and I will sign it,' what this President knows and what he clearly has demonstrated in the budget that he has sent to the Hill, is that it is not in balance. It is about $120 to $130 to $140 to $150 billion out of balance for the next 5 years. Then, if he really honors the tax cuts--which he does not, because he agrees in his budget that he takes them back to fund the deficit to create the balance in the outyears, because he needs more money--what he is really saying is that his budget is not in balance. Why? Partly because of interest on debt. 
Where does the National Government get $250 billion to pay its interest costs? By adding together all corporate income taxes, that is only $190 billion. Believe it or not, if we choose to double corporate income tax in this country we would just get enough and a little more to pay interest on debt. And all Federal excise taxes--that is $61 billion. I think the point I am making, and the point the Senator from Alaska made, is we do not believe the Congress truly has the will. We do not believe any President, Republican or Democrat, can find the total will to work for, make the tough choices, and get to a balanced budget in the kind of timeframe and with the kind of reasonableness that the American people have demanded of us. That is why I and others so strongly believe we need the kind of constitutional framework to operate within, that creates the kind of political discipline and fiscal discipline to produce a balanced budget. 
Who do we owe it to? We owe it to a lot of people. But most important, we owe it to future generations, because it is our children and our grandchildren who will pay off the debt. More important, if we continue to create debt without servicing debt, without bringing debt down in the future, more and more of the resources of our young, when they grow to maturity, will have to go to pay the creditor instead of fund the kind of Government they want, or to fund the kind of services they want from Government; but, more important, to keep some of their own money so they can have their own lives and their own families, and have their part of the American dream as our generation has had it. 
There need not be any pointed finger or accusation as to whose fault these budgets have been, because, while most of them in the 28-year period could be, arguably, Democratic budgets, a fair number of them were Republican budgets. 
A fair number of them were created under Republican Presidents. All of them were out of balance, and all of them had deficits, and all of them created the $5.3 trillion debt that this country experiences today. 
So I really think we ought to quit chasing our tail. The arguments that we have heard for the last decade are the same arguments, and the President makes the argument today that is certainly not original that a few Presidents before him have made but all who oppose a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution make. And that is that you cannot tie the hands of Government, that this would be much too rigid, that it would cause conflict within the economy, that it might cause us to not have the priorities in Government that we want. 
What they are really all saying is that nobody is willing to make the tough choices, and 28 years of budgets clearly demonstrate that. That is why I think it is important that we reflect on the words of Thomas Jefferson who said that if there is 1 more amendment to the 10, the 11th amendment he would have added was to disallow the ability of Government to borrow, because he was fearful of a representative republic being able to vote itself money, and we have done that year in and year out. 
As a result of that, we are now here wrestling, as all Presidents and Congresses do, with what do we do with the debt, what do we do with the deficit, and where do we find the money to spend on some of these critical programs. 
The Senator from Alaska is right. When a nation overspends itself, when a Congress no longer prioritizes as to where the limited resources of the tax dollars go, but takes $250 billion right off the top and says that has to go to interest on debt, Mr. President, it is time we change, and that is why many of us have stood on this floor and argued for years that this is the mechanism to bring that change, this is the mechanism to bring the kind of political and fiscal discipline and responsibility that this Congress must have, because there isn't a Senator on this floor who can just vote it without the real discipline that a Constitution brings. 
So this is why I hope that, in the ensuing days, all of our colleagues join together to support the balanced budget amendment to our Constitution and to give the citizens of this country the right, under the Constitution, to debate the issue in the capitals of their States to determine whether they want to change the organic law of this country to discipline this Government to cause this Government to react in a way that they perceive, as I, to be a much healthier action on behalf of the economy, the citizens and future generations. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me first of all react to the Senator from Vermont's inclusion of Jack Kemp's remarks of yesterday into the Record. Jack Kemp does not support our balanced budget because he feels it is not strong enough in one respect; it does not require the tax limitation that Jack Kemp believes is necessary. Over the years I have debated this at length with Congressman Kemp. He knows that what our amendment does is a substantial movement in the right direction. While I would have liked tax limitation over time, we know that is a vote that cannot be won on the floor of the Senate or the House. That is why we have left tax limitation up to the true limiters, and that is the electorate, to decide if a tax increase should produce a change in the makeup of the U.S. Congress. So we are not going to put our Government on automatic pilot, as would be the subtle insinuation of Senator Durbin in arguing that, somehow, this amendment is not flexible enough and therefore we need his majority-vote waiver. 
Let me talk about putting whims in the budget process, because I believe that is exactly what would be done if you favor the Durbin amendment. It does not require this Senate to make tough choices, and it creates almost an unlimited opportunity for deficit spending. The balanced budget amendment as we have proposed it, and as it has been introduced on the floor of the Senate by Senator Hatch, is flexible enough. It allows deficit spending if 60 percent, or three-fifths of the majority of the Congress, vote that way. If there is a true long-term emergency, the votes will be there to respond to it. 
Let me cite some examples. The Senator from Illinois knows these examples. He has participated, as have I, in a fair number of them. From 1962 to the present, there have been 12 economic stimulus packages passed by Congress. All 12 have received three-fifths votes in the Congress. So, every time there was a true emergency and collectively the Senate or the House decided it was just that, the three-fifths majority written into this balanced budget amendment was garnered. In other words, when there is legitimacy, and not just the easy pass go that we have had now for decades upon decades, that has built the stack of unbalanced budgets here on this table, but when it was really necessary, the record clearly shows that the support of three-fifths of the Congress was there. 
Of course, there was one so-called economic stimulus package that did not pass at first. We got involved in a filibuster in 1993 on a so-called stimulus package, but at that time a recovery was already underway. Every economist in the country said, `We are in a recovery; why are you pumping more deficit spending into the economy and risking a surge of inflation?' And, of course, we did filibuster, and that deficit spending package failed, largely because it was nickel-and-dime kind of stuff, to build a swimming pool here or paint a mural there or create some kind of make-work somewhere else. It had nothing to do with job training to a great extent, or job creation. Yet some were pushing it, even when economists were saying, `Yes, in fact, the economy is recovering.' 
But even when that first, large bill did not pass in 1993, an overwhelming majority of the Congress still showed compassion for those actually in need; we soon passed a stripped-down bill, which 
extended unemployment benefits. 
While we do not use the word `emergency' in the balanced budget amendment, clearly an emergency is whatever three-fifths of the Congress term it is. That is a reasonable test of what is a true emergency. So, those 12 economic stimulus packages that I referred to since 1962 were deemed by the Congress to be important enough to garner the three-fifths vote. Therefore the other day, several weeks ago, when the President said, `If you had a little flexibility in there for a recession,' and he was visiting with those of us who were proponents of this amendment, then he `would show some kind of interest in it.' I said, `Well, it is there, Mr. President. You need to recognize that we saw those needs and that is why we put inside the amendment the three-fifths requirement that would be necessary to deficit spend.' 
Some have said that recessions are often regional, that there are economic areas within our country that fail to respond to recovery, and that economics shifts occur unevenly. They say, without the Durbin amendment, it would be hard to provide relief in those cases. If that is the case, why has there not been why has there not been a long list of regional recession relief bills that have been defeated? Or that have passed only narrowly? No, the Congress has responded in time of need and that is why all of these bills have gotten the three-fifths vote that we thought was a necessary safeguard for this amendment. 
The Durbin amendment is based on a fundamental mistake. Let me repeat that. The Durbin amendment is based on what I believe to be a fundamental mistake. Regularly balanced budgets do not harm the economy, but saying they do is the mistake he makes. He assumes, as does the Secretary of the Treasury, that somehow balanced budgets are dangerous for the economy, or could create or worsen a downturn. And yet economists, liberal and conservative, argue a that balanced budgets will lead to a sustained 2- to 2.5-percent drop in the overall interest rates. They would create jobs and a higher standard of living. 
I see that as an economic stimulus. The balanced budget amendment would create economic stimulus. Regularly balanced budgets would help the economy. And yet we still recognized the need for putting into the amendment some flexibility in the case of a recession and Congress needing to respond to it. 
The Durbin amendment simply guts the balanced budget amendment. It would let a majority waive the requirement for a balanced budget on a whim. It does not require that there be a real recession, merely that Congress declare one. It would not just allow the amount of deficit spending supposedly necessary or unavoidable because of an economic emergency--it would allow unlimited deficit spending. 
If you go back and look at history, you find that economic growth was greater, and average unemployment was lower, during those periods in which budgets were regularly balanced. 
In fact, if Congress had passed the balanced budget amendment the first time I voted for it in 1982, the typical family's income would be $15,500 higher today. That is not my number, but was estimated by the Concord Coalition. According to the General Accounting Office, if we balance the budget and keep it balanced, after 20 years, our children's standard of living will be between 7 and 36 percent higher. 
Deficits are the problem. The debt is the threat to the economic security of our children, our seniors, and those who are vulnerable to changes in the economy. Former Senator Paul Simon brought in liberal economists who told us that the debt and deficit are so big, deficit spending is now useless as an economic stimulus. 
The evidence does not show that balancing the budget makes recessions more severe. Investors Business Daily pointed last week to a 1986 study the National Bureau of Economic Research that said, when you adjust for the different way data were collected before World War II, prewar and postwar recessions did not really differ significantly in length and severity. 
While the balanced budget amendment already, with its three-fifths vote requirement, anticipates the need to respond to a serious, long-term economic problem, the Durbin amendment seems concerned with a rapid response to short-term swings. But Congress has a notoriously bad track record when it comes to short-term responses to the economy. 
Every economic stimulus or anti-recession bill since 1949 was passed by Congress after the recession was over. But the Durbin amendment still requires Congress to vote to waive the balanced budget amendment--meaning it does not allow a prompt response, just an easy evasion. 
The Durbin amendment has nothing to do with so-called automatic stabilizers. The balanced budget amendment already allows for automatic stabilizers. Section 6 of the balanced budget amendment allows for the honest, good-faith use of estimates in legislation that implements a balanced budget. Read the committee report: If Congress makes good-faith, reasonable estimates of receipts and outlays, and then mid-year changes in the economy cause a temporary deficit, that would not trigger a three to five vote. Unemployment benefit checks, for example, would still go out. 
The problem is that we now have permanent deficits, in good times as well as bad.  
CONCLUSION 
We do not need a loophole in the balanced budget amendment--like the Durbin amendment. We need to change the bleak status quo. Our $5 trillion debt--growing by more than $8,000 a second--proves that we have a long-term problem. This stack on the Senate floor of the last 28 unbalanced budgets--14 of which promised balance but did not deliver--demonstrates that this problem requires a permanent solution. If we pass the balanced budget amendment, we will create an economic bill of rights for the 21st century.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me draw to a conclusion my debate on this amendment, because I hope that we can table this amendment. I see no reason to write that kind of language into the Constitution. We have given clearly the kind of flexibility that the Congress has needed in the past to respond. 
It isn't by accident that we picked three-fifths. When you go back and analyze past actions of Congress and economic stimulus packages that meet the definition of an emergency or what's needed for recessionary recovery, that is exactly what this amendment is designed to respond to. I believe it does, and I hope that our colleagues will join with us in tabling this effort. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me make note of the comments of the Senator from Kansas. They are so appropriate and so well directed at what we can do here as it relates to controlling our spending and modifying programs that do just that and produce long-term benefits. 
The Senator from Kansas last year, of course, was a major player and author of the Freedom to Farm Act while he was chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. That very act changed the whole dynamics of Government policy as it related to farm programs and Government's relationship to production agriculture. 
He spoke of the net savings in the tens of billions of dollars that will result over an extended period of time. I would guess that less than a few years ago, many Senators and many Members of the U.S. House would have said, `That can't be done; you cannot sever that relationship.' And yet, we have severed it. 
Agriculture continues to prosper every bit as well as it did tied directly to the Government and Government programs and, we believe, in the long term will prosper more, simply because it is not relying on farming-to-Government programs but, in fact, is now looking at the market and producing to the market, as we had hoped it would. 
That was one major benefit in change that occurred in the 104th Congress. 
Another one that occurred that is, in the long term, going to substantially get us to the point by 2002 of a balanced budget, of course, was the welfare reform. 
So when the kind of pandering that occurs here on the floor, often from the other side, that there is no way to balance the budget, or, if you balance it, you must begin to exempt major portions of the budget because they are too sensitive, too important and no constraints must be put upon them of the kind that a constitutional amendment would place upon them, so, therefore, they must be exempt, I would argue just the opposite, that all it forces us to do is make tough choices, priorities, where should the dollars be spent. 
Of course, we all know we are going to build and maintain a strong human safety net in Government policy for the citizens of this country who are poor or disadvantaged or need an opportunity. That is exactly what has been and will remain a concern of this Congress always. 
All we are asking, and what I think we are causing to happen, is what the American people have been asking now for well over a decade. Out of fear--now fright--that this Congress cannot control a Federal debt, they are saying, `Balance your budget.' 
Of course, the Senator from Kansas and I, the day before yesterday, referenced this large stack of 28 consecutive budgets that are piled here beside me, to recognize that 14 of them have deficit spending, with all the intent to deficit spend and no intent to balance. And 14 of them have the intent to balance, where the Congress collectively, in producing the budgets, said it is our intent that these budgets lead to a balanced budget. 
Yet, of course, we now have evidence, by the President's budget coming to us yesterday, that in all the rhetoric and all the time that he expended and all the good intentions that he expended in the State of the Union Message this week, referencing a balanced 
budget many, many times, that his budget isn't balanced, won't even balance unless you do major cuts and major tax increases, largely because he is habitually the kind of public leader that we have had for so many years, who wants to constantly add new programs without making the tough choices of deleting programs so that you can add. 
I am not suggesting the programs the President spoke of are not contemporary and necessary. When he spoke to education the other night, I applauded a fair amount of what he said. But I am willing to stand here and make the tough votes to suggest spending ought to decrease somewhere else if we as a country are going to shift our priorities in spending to education. 
We now have an amendment before us that would impact the whole intent of a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution, and those are tough choices, prioritizing and doing exactly what the American people expect us to do, and that is balance the budget. If 51 of us can say, `Oh, we can't balance the budget, the environment is too extreme at the moment, economically at this point in the country or the priorities of spending are we just have to bypass this national mandate, this constitutional mandate and do it only by 51 votes here in the Senate,' then I suggest to you this amendment wipes away the full intent of a balanced budget amendment and causes us, if that were to become part of the balanced budget amendment, to gimmick up the Constitution by simply doing exactly what we do now. 
So we are telling the American people that the amendment that is before us is one where, `Oh, we have given you a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Rest assured we have given you what you wanted, but more importantly, we have now simply represcribed business as usual.' 
It is with those frustrations that I think we are now suggesting that this is an amendment--the amendment to the constitutional amendment, the one before us--is one that does not deserve to be in the Constitution, because it would be false pretense to argue it any other way. 
Yesterday, there was a fascinating article from Investors Business Daily that I thought was very reminiscent of the very arguments we are placing here on the floor. The President had expressed concern about the ability to react promptly in a recession and, of course, the amendment we have before us would argue that that is what it allows. When the President said that, I said, `Mr. President, we have provided for that. We have a three-fifths vote in the amendment now.' It is a tough vote. It is not always easy to come by, but it is a necessary vote to force us to the reality. 
Let me suggest that Congress, in 1962, passed 12 economic stimulus bills because of a recession. All 12 bills received 60 votes or more in the U.S. Senate. In 1993, in a stimulus package, there were similar kind of votes. 
What I am suggesting is that the record is replete with a voting pattern that says if we are truly in a major economic emergency and there is need for economic stimulus, that the very marker we have put in the proposed constitutional amendment that we are debating on the floor is the proper mark and not 51 votes. 
So what Investors Business Daily said yesterday was:  
The idea that deficit spending could smooth out the rough spots in a business cycle comes from John Maynard Keynes. Recessions, he believed, started when all the buyers in the economy suddenly stopped spending. . . 
The evidence shows that public works programs have done nothing to solve recessions, a 1993 article by economist Bruce Bartlett in The Public Interest magazine pointed out. 
Spending packages aimed at fighting recession have never been enacted before a recession ended on its own. 
In other words, they always came after all of the indicators were in place that the recession was over. 
Recessions are usually defined as two straight quarters of falling GDP. So no one actually knows a recession is happening until six months after it starts. No one knows it's over until three months later. 
That is the reality of how we define `recession.' Yet, the amendment that we have before us to amend the resolution would argue that we know better.

Mr. CRAIG. It is important to recognize that while the politics of the argument are interesting, the record would suggest that it does not fit, that Congress has always responded to recessions after they were over. And, in fact, what ended up usually was pork-barrel spending that became a part of the total budget program that went on.  
Between 1980 and 1984--which includes years of deep recession--real spending on jobless benefits rose $47.4 billion above its level in 1979, an economic peak. That increase was just 1% of government spending over those four years. 
Recessions have been less severe in the postwar period, many economists argue. 
That is exactly the point of those figures, the argument that somehow we straitjacket our Government by a balanced budget not able to respond to times of recession, and the facts simply do not bear it out, the economic facts, not mine, but those of the economists who study this. 
So when Secretary Rubin fears straitjacketing, what Secretary Rubin fears is that the American people will once again have control of their budget and the spending of the Federal Government and that we take it out of the hands of politicians and force them to stay within parameters and make the tough choices and to stop mounting the huge Federal debt that we are currently having. 
That is the essence of a balanced budget amendment. That is why we are here on the floor, because the American people have asked us to do this. I am one of those who believes so strongly that the record is replete with the facts that we as politicians cannot do it. 
Some of us can make those tough votes; others cannot for various reasons. It is true that, as never before, special interest groups come to Washington for a piece of the pie. So it is easy to give it away and make the pie bigger. The only problem is we borrow hundreds of billions of dollars annually to make the pie, expecting future generations to pay for the ingredients. Therein lies the great discrepancy, why we are here. 
It is an important issue. We must fight to make sure that we retain it and that we pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment resolution and disallow the kind of amendments that would weaken it or make it hollow at best. We cannot put that kind of language in our Constitution. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I think we are about to conclude the business of the Senate for today. Prior to that happening, I want to make some opening observations about this historic constitutional amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, that we have on the floor this evening and on which we have started debate. 
Let me also say to my colleague from Minnesota, who has eloquently and passionately laid out a variety of critically important items for us to debate in the coming days, my colleague from Minnesota mentioned programs that I support. I have always voted for Head Start, and I have always voted for Women, Infants and Children. Those are very important programs for our country. I am also one who says those programs have to be funded within the context of a balanced budget. 
I am standing here beside this 6-foot tall stack of budget documents, what I call the budgets of the era of liberalism. This is when America said that poor people ought to be cared for, and unprecedented in the world, this Nation poured out its riches to the poor. Mr. President, 28 years of budgets are represented here, and benefits resulted from some of what was in them. 
We started the WIC program. We started Head Start in these budgets. They were funded last year and will continue to be funded. But what happened along the way? People did not seem to get better. People seemed to get poorer. While this Nation spoke about having a safety net, and it must speak to the need for a safety net for the truly needy, we began to learn lessons in the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's. We began to learn that handouts are not necessarily a hand up. In a society as wealthy as ours, while we truly need to be kind and caring--and the Senator from Minnesota is truly that, and I think that all Senators are--somehow, along the way, we began to realize that the cumulative effect of all these spending programs was to put the whole Nation at risk. These 28 budgets--28 budget packages submitted by six presidents, both Democrats and Republicans--also represent $5.3 trillion worth of debt. Enough money is paid out annually in interest to service the debt that these budgets created to fund all the programs that the Senator from Minnesota wants and many, many more. 
That is what the debate is about today. This debate is not about Women, Infants, and Children. This debate is not about Head Start. This debate is about fiscal responsibility. This debate is about making tough policy choices. 
I am amazed that the Senator from Minnesota would fear the constitutional amendment, as eloquent as he is on the issues that he is impassioned about, because he can appeal to me and he will get my vote--within the context of a balanced budget--for Head Start and for Women, Infants, and Children. Then he and I, working together, will have to work with our other colleagues to make sure that we choose a rational spending policy that prioritizes these programs because we decide to reduce elsewhere. 
What I will not do and what this Congress will not do is send to the American people for ratification a constitutional amendment with a loophole in it large enough to drive all of the trucks that service the industries in Minnesota through. We dare not send to the American people a phony document that they might put in the Constitution, in which we exempt all of these programs from the responsible decisionmaking that the Senator from Minnesota and I want to make here on the floor. 
Should we exempt Social Security? If we exempted Social Security and Women, Infants, and Children and Head Start and all of the other programs being suggested, that is probably better than a third of the budget. How can we turn to the American people and say now we have a balanced budget when we just took a third of it off-budget? No longer would we have the right to make the choice to set priorities. These would autopilot programs. But instead of protecting these programs, they would become the loophole through which to channel all sorts of new and increased spending. I do not think the Senator from Minnesota wants that. I think what the Senator from Minnesota is speaking to is setting priorities, 
making tough choices for the right reasons on the right issues for people who are less fortunate. If that is what he means, and I know he means that because I know him well, then he will have the Presiding Officer's support and he will have my support. 
What we would like to ask him to do is to join us in pleading that we get away from this stack of 28 unbalanced budgets in a row, that we get away from adding to this $5.3 trillion worth of debt, with its $340 billion a year worth of interest to service the debt. Those huge interest payments actually strip this country of its resources to do what that Senator wants done. If we did not have to pay all that interest, if we had paid off the past Federal debts, then we would have a surplus today of more than $100 billion a year, available to spend on programs like those the Senator from Minnesota advances. 
The American people now agree with us. Mr. President, 70 or 80 percent plus of the American people say a balanced budget is critical. President Clinton said last night he was sending us a balanced budget tomorrow. I bet he funds WIC, and I bet he funds Head Start, and I bet inside that budget is Social Security. This President, our President, last night said that was a balanced budget. 
A few moments ago the Senator from Massachusetts was on the floor, and he said we should treat Social Security differently--that there will be an amendment to treat Social Security differently--from how we, the Republicans and some Democrats want to under the balanced budget. He said he wanted to keep it separate and apart. Then he spoke eloquently about the President's budget, and the President treats Social Security exactly the way Republicans want to treat it, 
leaving it inside the budget, making sure that our Government's fiscal house is in order so that a government whose budget is balanced is a government that can meet its obligation. That is really the issue here, and that is the crux of the debate that will go on over the course of the next several weeks. 
The Senator from Minnesota has approached us this afternoon with four amendments. They are important amendments and they should be debated; they should be voted on. I hope that my colleagues, in considering any amendment, will consider that all of the budget be a part of the whole and the whole should be balanced. The Secretary of the Treasury does not suggest that we split anything out of the budget. He suggests that we deal with a whole budget, that we don't start prying things apart. The President will present that kind of a budget tomorrow. The reason that we want to make sure that happens is that it is time this country makes the tough choices. I think that when we make those tough choices, under the responsibility of a balanced budget requirement in our Constitution, social spending programs critical to the truly needy of our country will survive. 
For a few moments, Mr. President, let me talk about what stands before us here. Twenty-eight years of endlessly unbalanced budgets are stacked here at my right hand, 28 years of deficit spending, 28 years since the last time this Government balanced its budget in 1969. Now, 14 of these 28 budgets were never intended to be balanced. They were intended to be in deficit, to create debt. But 14 of them--the other half--promised a balanced budget at some point. It was the same kind of promise we heard from President Clinton last night. These were sincere promises, all 14 of these budgets that promised eventual balance, spread over the last 28 years. And I do not question this President's sincerity in promising yet another budget that reaches balance in a few years. I believe that he believes he can produce a balanced budget. 
What was the rhetoric last night? `You vote for it and I will sign it.' The problem is choice making--choice making in an environment in which we don't have to make hard choices. And as a result of not having to make hard choices, wanting to serve the needs of the American people, wanting to address the truly needy, Congresses and Presidents instead have made easy choices, 28 long years of easy choices. 
Oh, they were tough choices at the time, or at least they felt tough. But when you know you don't have to balance the budget--you do not really set priorities and make hard choices. And we went through an era when deficit spending was supposed to be good because it supposedly stimulated the economy and created jobs. Well, that may have been all right in some instances when we didn't have a $5.3 trillion debt, when service on the debt was $5 or $6 billion a year and was a minuscule part of a total budget. All of a sudden, over the last decade and a half, this debt has exploded on the American scene and on the American taxpayer's pocketbook. Today, Social Security and the interest on debt created by these 28 budgets now rival each other as to which is the largest single expenditure in the annual budgets of the Federal Government. 
That is why, consistently over recent years, the American people have said to this Congress--Republican or Democrat-- `Get your fiscal house in order and balance the Federal budget.' Seventy-plus percent of the American people want a constitutional amendment. But recently polled, only 12 percent really believed that we would get to a balanced budget by the year 2002. Why? Here is the reason why: 28 consistent years of promises made and promises broken to the real people of this country, the taxpayer who now feels exploited and put upon largely because this Congress and Congresses like it promised but failed to deliver. Twenty-eight years of budgets submitted by Presidents that promised deficit reduction or balanced budgets that never came to be. 
Twenty-eight years of borrowing, a total of 36 deficits in 37 years, $5.3 trillion worth of gross debt. That is $20,000 of debt for every man, woman, and child in America. So the majority of all 
the real people living in this country today have seen a budget actually balanced only once or never. And they now question the integrity of their Government and the reality of what this country really is about and, more important, what its politicians are about. 
We will honor the promises made by Social Security because we want to and because we must. It is a contract with the elderly of our country. A government whose budget is balanced is a government that can honor that pledge. A government that is in bankruptcy sends no checks out to a defense contractor, to an elderly person, or to a single parent on welfare. 
That's the reality of the debate. Somehow we think there are special needs that could get separated out. At a time when our Government finds its fiscal house increasingly in trouble, if it goes bankrupt, no checks go out. That is why, for over 3 years, those who believe in a balanced budget amendment have argued against those who wish to exempt out Social Security and other unique social programs. We understand that the threat to Social Security, the threat to Women, Infants and Children, the threat to Head Start, is not the balanced budget amendment, but the debt. Why are we having to cut back on spending on some programs today? Because we did not balance the budget for so many years before now. Because of deficits and because of a huge, heavy debt structure, and because the American people are saying, `Fix it, it's broken, correct it.' 
What does it mean? What does this stack of paper--thousands of pages of debt--say to the average American family? Well, it's something like this, in the sense of what it costs them. Since the time I started debating this issue in 1982 until today it represents $15,000 for every American family in income loss, minimally--$15,000. That means that the average American family's income today--if we had balanced the Federal budget in 1982 and kept it balanced until 1997--would be $15,000 more. Those are not my figures. Those are the figures based on a study by the Concord Coalition. We talk of the needy and of wanting to care for people. Put an extra $15,000 in every American family's budget and see what kind of help you have offered them. But, instead, the Government has taken those fruits of their hard work to service the debt structure represented by 28 years of profligate deficit spending. 
What does it mean to a household with a 30-year mortgage if the economists are right and we pass this amendment and balance the budget? Interest rates drop 1 1/2 to 2 points. And that $30,000 to the average American family, saved on a 30-year mortgage, is a year in one of the most expensive colleges in the country. Or if you are in Idaho, that is 2 1/2 to 3 years of college education in our land grant university. That is a lot of money. Where does it go today? Out of the working person's pocketbook into the IRS coffers to pay to service the debt structure created right here by Congresses past--caring and well-meaning Congresses--that created this stack of paper representing $5.3 trillion worth of debt. 
Well, if there is frustration in this debate for some of our Members, I don't reject their concerns and I don't take it lightly. I must say that it may be frustration that we have inflicted upon ourselves, because it is now necessary to propose a constitutional amendment that is very simple. It gives us plenty of latitude to get our fiscal house in order by 2002. It does so in a way that also creates the necessary flexibility in times of real need and in times of war. It says that there are margins in which deficit spending can occur, but now it will take tough choices to deficit spend, 
not the automatic and easy choices of past years, not `oh, well, we will make it up next year or a few years down the road.' 
We will see a variety of amendments to the balanced budget amendment that will come to the floor in the next several weeks. Senators that will talk impassionedly about certain priorities that are all critical and all important. And all these priorities can be served inside a balanced budget by tough decisions and tough choices on this Congress. 
What am I talking about this evening? Correcting a problem that we created, correcting a problem that threatens--not me, not the Presiding Officer, and not the Senator from Vermont, but his children, my children, our grandchildren, and future generations of American citizens who will want to be as productive as we hope we have been. 
How important is correcting that problem of adding to the debt? The Office of Management and Budget--President Clinton's Office of Management and Budget--said that if we continue down the path that this Congress and other Congresses have been on, future generations would pay 82 percent of their total income in taxes for all levels of government because of debt, debt service, and government needs--82 percent. That means there is no money left to buy a house, there is no money to put in a savings account for a rainy day, and there is no money left for a college education. 
So what happens? You turn to your government, and the endless process is always underway of a government having to do something for more people because government has taken so much from those who worked so hard and find themselves getting nowhere. 
That is why this has to be corrected, or there will be no future for the young people of our country. Because a future in which 82 percent of your gross pay goes to all levels of government is no future at all. Those are some of the kinds of things we are talking about. 
A child born today--again, not my figures, but those of the National Taxpayers Union--a child born today will pay an additional $180,000 in taxes during his or her lifetime to service the Federal debt--debt that his or her grandmas and grandpas spent but didn't pay for. And that is a tragedy. 
Our friend Paul Simon, the now retired Senator from Illinois, who is as liberal as I am conservative but who stood shoulder to shoulder with me for a decade fighting the battle of the balanced budget amendment to our Constitution, called it fiscal child abuse. And he is right. Because that legacy of crushing debt is no future for any child born in America today, having that obligation out in front of them, being required of them by their Government for from which something they get no value. That is why this issue has become the No. 1 issue in America. 
Our President spoke of valuable priorities last night, important issues--education, some tax cuts, the kind of priorities that an American wants to be proud of and wants to be a part of. Republican or Democrat, there were many of us who heard a President last night speak of issues that we can all identify with. But in doing so, we say, with a simple caveat: They must be within the limit and the capacity of the ability of the Government to pay for them, and the permission of our citizens to pay for them, within a balanced budget. It is a simple requirement. The problem is that the choices are tough, but that is what my job is and that is what I have hired on to do, as has the Presiding Officer, and as has the Senator from Vermont. 
In the coming days, as we debate, I hope we can see the very clear differences between those who oppose requiring fiscal responsibility, who do not want the citizens of this country through the Constitution to impose that kind of discipline on the floor of this Senate, and those of us who say that after 28 years of endless spending, endless debt, and endless deficits, it is time we offer the American people the choice of whether to require that kind of constitutional discipline. 
The time is growing late. It is our intent to adjourn as soon 
as we can. But the debate will go on through tomorrow and next week, and we hope through the balance of February, as we deal with this issue and as Members of the Senate speak their will, as they should, because I know of no issue more important than this constitutional amendment. 
Our vote will not make it so. Our Founding Fathers decided that was not our job. Our vote is simply to propose to the American people a constitutional amendment. And then 38 States, three-fourths of the States must vote to ratify, and the debate will go on in every State capital across this country--the debate about Government, the Federal Government, and its budgets and its priorities. And that will be one of the healthiest debates the American citizenry has ever been involved in. From that, Senators serving in this Congress and future Congresses will not only have the absolute constitutional requirement to balance the budget, but they will probably have a much clearer idea of what the American people expect of their Federal Government. That ratification process is an important process. If we send forth this amendment, we will have started in this country what I think not only assures that we get our fiscal house in order, but it assures future generations the same kind of opportunity that all of us have had in our lifetime. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today, which this body previously approved as an amendment to the first bill amending the Fair Labor Standards Act [FLSA] that the Senate passed in 1989. This bill would solve a problem with the interpretation of a provision of the FLSA, clarifying that the maximum hour exemption for agricultural employees applies to water delivery organizations that supply 75 percent or more of their water for agricultural purposes. 
Representative Mike Crapo, of the Second District of Idaho, is today introducing an identical bill in the other body. Our bill would restore an exemption that was always intended by Congress. 
Companies that delivery water for agricultural purposes are exempt from the maximum-hour requirements of the FLSA. The Department of Labor has interpreted this to mean that no amount of this water, however minimal, can be used for other purposes. Therefore, if even a small portion of the water delivered winds up being used for road watering, lawn and garden irrigation, livestock consumption, or construction, for example, delivery organizations are assessed severe penalties. 
The exemption for overtime pay requirements was placed in the FLSA to protect the economies of rural areas. Irrigation has never been, and cannot be, a 40-hour-per-week undertaking. During the summer, water must be managed and delivered continually. Later in the year, following the harvest, the work load is light, consisting mainly of maintenance duties. 
Our bill is better for employers, workers, and farmers. Winter compensation and time off traditionally have been the method of compensating for longer summer hours. Without this exemption, irrigators are forced to lay off their employees in the winter. Therefore, our bill would benefit employees, who would continue to earn a year-round income. It also would keep costs level, which would benefit suppliers and consumers.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to place in the Record the remarks of a great American statesman who I and many of us had the privilege to watch being recognized in the White House on January 17. I speak to Senator Bob Dole and his leadership in our Nation, his statesmanship, his patriotism, and especially the comments he made in receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom on January 17. 
I think we were all captivated in the evening news by the great humor of Bob Dole--after this very prestigious ceremony in the East Room of the White House with the President offering up one of these most coveted recognitions in our Nation for the leader, Bob Dole, former Presidential candidate--when he stepped forward and in humor began to recite his oath of office. 
That statement overshadowed the statement that was to follow, and that was the statement by Bob Dole as to his feelings and his emotions that are a part of the person that you, Mr. President, and I have grown to know and respect over the years as it relates to his Americanism, his leadership, and his patriotism. 
So it is with that in mind that I insert into the Record this afternoon the statement that Senator Dole made that afternoon, this January 17, at the White House as he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It was a beautiful statement. It was an emotional statement. And for all of us who were there, it was the statement of a man who we had grown to know and who we knew as a Senator from Kansas, who we knew as a Presidential candidate, but most importantly a man who we knew as a leader of the U.S. Senate, a great American, a great American statesman, and a great American patriot. 
With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Bob Dole as he received his Presidential Medal of Freedom award be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that has been forced by recent events. I am talking about President Clinton's proclamation of last fall declaring nearly two million acres of southern Utah a national monument. 
After the President's announcement, Senator Kempthorne and I introduced the Idaho Protection Act of 1996. That bill would have required that the public and the Congress be included before a national monument could be established in Idaho. 
When we introduced that bill, I was immediately approached by other Senators seeking the same protection. What we see unfolding before us in Utah ought to frighten all of us. Without including Utah's Governor, Senators, congressional delegation, the State legislature, county commissioners, or the people of Utah--President Clinton set off-limits forever approximately 1.7 million acres of Utah. 
Under the 1906 Antiquities Act, President Clinton has the unilateral authority to create a national monument where none existed before. And if he can do it in the State of Utah, he can do it in Idaho. In fact, since 1906, the law has been used some 66 times to set lands aside. I would note--with very few exceptions, these declarations occurred before enactment of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 which recognized the need for public involvement in such issues and mandated public comment periods before such decisions are made. 
Just as 64 percent of the land in Utah is owned by the Federal Government, 62 percent of Idaho is owned by Uncle Sam. What the President has done in Utah, without public input, he could also do in Idaho or any or the States where the Federal Government has a presence. 
With Senator Kempthorne as a cosponsor, I am once again introducing the Idaho Protection Act. This bill would simply require that the public and the Congress be fully involved and give approval before such a unilateral Presidential declaration of a new national monument could be imposed on Idaho. 
The President's action in Utah has been a wake-up call to people across America. While we all want to preserve what is best in our States, people everywhere understand that much of their economic future is tied up in what happens on their public lands. 
In the West, where public lands dominate the landscape, issues such as grazing, timber harvesting, water use, and recreation access have all come under attack by this administration seemingly bent upon kowtowing to a segment of our population that wants these uses kicked off our public lands. 
Everyone wants public lands decisions to be made in an open and inclusive process. No one wants the President, acting alone, to unilaterally lock up enormous parts of any State. We certainly don't work that way in the West. There is a recognition that with common sense, a balance can be struck that allows jobs to grow and families to put down roots while at the same time protecting America's great natural resources. 
In my view, the President's actions are beyond the pale and for that reason--to protect others from suffering a similar fate, I am cosponsoring this bill.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today we begin a new Congress and an urgent environmental problem remains unresolved. Today I am reintroducing legislation to address the problem that continues to vex us--that is, how to address our Nation's high-level nuclear waste disposal. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 that is introduced today answers this problem and is responsible, fair, environmentally friendly, and supported by Members of both parties. 
Today, high-level nuclear waste and highly radioactive used nuclear fuel continues to accumulate at more than 80 sites in 41 States. Each year, as more and more fuel accumulates and our ability to continue to store this used fuel at each of these sites in a safe and responsible way diminishes. The only responsible choice is to support legislation that solves this problem by safely moving this used fuel to a safe, monitored facility in the remote Nevada desert. This answer will lead us to a safer future for all Americans. 
To facilitate our consideration of such legislation, Senator Murkowski and I along with 16 other cosponsors are introducing a bill to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. This legislation is identical to S. 1936 that passed the Senate toward the end of the past Congress. Unfortunately, that legislation was not acted upon by the other body nor signed into law. It is my intent to assure that is not the fate of this legislation. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will hold a hearing on this bill on February 5 and will move to a speedy markup. I encourage the Senate and House to act quickly and to send it to the President for his signature. 
This bill contains all of the important clarifications and changes addressing the concerns that were raised prior to and during floor debate in the 104th Congress. This is legislation that will allow a solution for nuclear waste disposal. Let us move forward to enact it into law. I encourage the administration to work with us to make that a reality. 
This bill provides a clear and simple choice. We can choose to have one, remote, safe, and secure nuclear waste storage facility. Or, through inaction and delay, we can perpetuate the status quo and have 80 such sites spread across the Nation. The courts have made clear the Department of Energy must act to dispose of this material in 1998. It is irresponsible to shirk our responsibility to protect the environment and the future for our children and grandchildren. This Nation needs to confront its nuclear waste problem now. I urge my colleagues to support the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Agricultural Work Force Stability and Protection Act. This bill would make needed reforms to the so-called `H-2A Program,' the program intended by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow for a reliable supply of legal, temporary, immigrant workers in the agricultural sector, under terms that also provide reasonable worker protections, when there is a shortage of domestic labor in this sector. 
Last year, Senator Alan Simpson, then the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, and then this body as a whole, acknowledged the importance of this issue by agreeing to including in the Illegal Immigration Reform conference report some compromise language regarding the Sense of the Congress on the H-2A Program and requiring the General Accounting Office to review the effectiveness of the program. 
The language included in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 was essentially the same as language agreed to in the conference report on fiscal year 1997 Agriculture Appropriations. With these provisions, the Congress went on record twice on the importance of having a program that helps ensure an adequate workforce for agricultural producers. 
This is an issue that is of the utmost importance to this country's farmers and ranchers, especially in light of the impact that immigration reform will have on the supply of agricultural labor. There is very real concern among Idaho farmers and throughout the country that these reforms will reduce the availability of agricultural workers. 
Farmers need access to an adequate supply of workers and want to have certainty that they are hiring a legal work force. In 1995, the total agricultural work force was about 2.5 million people. That equals 6.7 percent of our labor force, which is directly involved in production agriculture and food processing. 
Hired labor is one of the most important and costly inputs in farming. U.S. farmers spent more than $15 billion on hired labor expenses in 1992--one of every eight dollars of farm production expenses. For the labor-intensive fruit, vegetable and horticultural sector, labor accounts for 35 to 45 percent of production costs. 
The competitiveness of U.S. agriculture, especially in the fruit, vegetable and horticultural specialty sectors, depends on the continued availability of hired labor at a reasonable cost. U.S. farmers, including producers of labor-intensive perishable commodities, compete directly with producers in other countries for market share in both U.S. and foreign commodity markets. 
Wages of U.S. farmworkers will not be forced up by eliminating alien labor, because growers' production costs are capped by world market commodity prices. Instead, a reduction in the work force available to agriculture will force U.S. producers to reduce production to the level that can be sustained by a smaller work force. 
Over time, wages for these farm workers have actually risen faster than non-farm worker wages. Between 1986-1994, there was a 34.6 percent increase in average hourly earnings for farm workers, while non-farm workers only saw a 27.1 percent increase. 
Even with this increase in on-farm wages, this country has historically been unable to provide a sufficient number of domestic workers to complete the difficult manual labor required in the production of many agricultural commodities. In Idaho, this is especially true for producers of fruit, sugar beets, onions and other specialty crops. 
The difficulty in obtaining sufficient domestic workers is primarily due to the fact that domestic workers prefer the security of full-time employment in year round positions. As a result the available domestic work force tends to prefer the long term positions, leaving the seasonal jobs unfilled. In addition, many of the seasonal jobs unfilled. In addition, many of the seasonal agricultural jobs are located in areas where it is necessary for workers to migrate into the area and live temporarily to do the work. Experience has shown that foreign workers are more likely to migrate than domestic workers. As a result of domestic short supply, farmers and ranchers have had to rely upon the assistance of foreign workers. 
The only current mechanism available to admit foreign workers for agricultural employment is the H-2A program. The H-2A program is intended to serve as a safety valve for times when domestic labor is unavailable. Unfortunately, the H-2A program isn't working. 
Despite efforts to streamline the temporary worker program in 1986, it now functions so poorly that few in agriculture use it without risking an inadequate work force, burdensome regulations and potential litigation expense. In fact, usage of the program has actually decreased from 25,000 workers in 1986 to only 17,000 in 1995. 
The bill I am introducing would provide some much-needed reforms to the H-2A program. I urge my colleagues to consider the following reasonable modifications of the H-2A program. 
First, the bill would reduce the advance filing deadline from 60 to 40 days before workers are needed. In many agricultural operations, 60 days is too far in advance to be able to predict labor needs with the precision required in H-2A applications. Furthermore, virtually all referrals of U.S. workers who actually report for work are made close to the date of need. The advance application period serves little purpose except to provide time for litigation. 
Second, in lieu of the present certification letter, the Department of Labor [DOL] would issue the employer a domestic recruitment report indicating that the employer's job offer meets the statutory criteria and lists the number of U.S. workers referred. The employer would then file a petition with INS for admission of aliens, including a copy of DOL's domestic recruitment report and any countervailing evidence concerning the adequacy of the job offer and/or the availability of U.S. workers. The Attorney General would make the admission decision. The purpose is to restore the role of the Labor Department to that of giving advice to the Attorney General on labor availability, and return decision making to the Attorney General. 
Third, the Department of Labor would be required to provide the employer with a domestic recruitment report not later than 20 days before the date of need. The report either states sufficient domestic workers are not available or gives the names and Social Security numbers of the able, willing and qualified workers who have been referred to the employer. The Department of Labor now denies certification not only on the basis of workers actually referred to the employer, but also on the basis of reports or suppositions that unspecified numbers of workers may become available. The proposed change would assure that only workers actually identified as available would be the basis for denying foreign workers. 
Fourth, the Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS] would provide expedited processing of employers' petitions, and, if approved, notify the visa issuing consulate or port of entry within 15 calendar days. This would ensure timely admission decisions. 
Fifth, INS would provide expedited procedures for amending petitions to increase the number of workers admitted on 5 days before the date of need. This is to reduce the paperwork and increase the timeliness of obtaining needed workers very close to or after the work has started. 
Sixth, DOL would continue to recruit domestic workers and make referrals to employers until 5 days before the date of need. This method is needed to allow the employer at a date certain to complete his hiring, and to operate without having the operation disrupted by having to displace existing workers with new workers. 
Seventh, the bill would enumerate the specific obligations of employers in occupations in which H-2A workers are employed. The proposed definition would define jobs that meet the following criteria as not adversely affecting U.S. workers:  
1. The employer offers a competitive wage for the position. 
2. The employer would provide approved housing, or a reasonable housing allowance, to workers whose permanent place of residence is beyond normal commuting distance. 
3. The employer continues to provide current transportation reimbursement requirements. 
4. A guarantee of employment is provided for at least three-quarters of the anticipated hours of work during the actual period of employment. 
5. The employer would provide workers' compensation or equivalent coverage. 
6. Employer must comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local labor laws with respect to both United States and alien workers. 
This combination of employment requirements would eliminate the discretion of Department of Labor to specify terms and conditions of employment on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the scope for litigation would be reduced since employers (and the courts) would know with particularity the required terms and conditions of employment. 
Eighth, the bill would provide that workers must exhaust administrative remedies before engaging their employers in litigation. 
Ninth, certainty would be given to employers who comply with the terms of an approved job order. If at a later date the Department of Labor requires changes, the employer would be required to comply with the law only prospectively. This very important provision removes the possibility of retroactive liability if an approved order is changed. 
As the Illegal Immigration Reform law is implemented, action on these H-2A reforms will be necessary in the coming months to avoid jeopardizing the labor supply for American agriculture. 
Therefore, I am introducing this bill at this time and invite and urge my colleagues to sign on as cosponsors. It is time to begin in earnest to discuss these issues and examine these vitally-needed reforms. I hope and expect the Senate will pass constructive legislation along these lines this year.

Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the senior Senator from Utah for yielding but for a moment, to add to the comments that he has made as we have introduced S.J. Res. 1, or Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget constitutional amendment. The Senator from Utah has outlined, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, what we bring to the floor and the very critical nature of this debate. For a moment, let me humanize it, if I can, as to what it means to you, to me, to our children, and to the future of this country. 
Without a fiscally responsible Government that begins to rein in the growth of the Federal debt, already at 5.3 trillion dollars, and the ongoing year-after-year multibillion-dollar deficit that we have seen now for decades, the financial future of our country and its citizens is in doubt. There is no question today that the Congress and our President mouth the words of a balanced budget. We even work toward that by the very actions undertaken in writing the annual budgets. 
To guarantee it, to assure that when it gets to the time of making the tough votes to truly create a balanced budget, can we do it? Will we have the will of the people behind us and the support to accomplish that? I think that, absent a balanced budget amendment, the strength will not be there. I say that having watched this institution for many decades, and recognize that in the end when it really comes to the business of sorting out Government, the decisions become very tough. 
If we pass a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution this year, and if the States ratify it within the next 2 years, we will offer to the young people born today a unique opportunity. What is that opportunity? That they will pay in their lifetime $180,000 less in taxes, compared to what they would pay under the trends of the status quo, because of the rate at which our Government currently grows. 
We will offer to the average American family an opportunity unprecedented, and that is a better standard of living and actually more take-home pay and more dollars to spend, on an annualized basis, of more than $1,500 a year, in addition to their current income. We will offer our senior citizens the economic security we have promised them, by protecting Social Security and Medicare from the ravages of a massive debt and interest payments that crowd out all our other priorities. Let us remember, the debt is the threat to Social Security and to our seniors. 
When the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Idaho began to work to convince the Congress and the American people that a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget was necessary in the early 1980's, if it had passed at that time, if it had become part of the Constitution, the Concord Coalition and others have estimated that the average income per American family today would be $15,000 more than it currently is. I think, from that kind of fact, you begin to recognize the power and the importance of what we offer up today. You begin to recognize the very critical nature of what a $5.3 trillion debt really is, and how it is growing by $800 million a day and more than $9,000 a second. If this Senate is to stand in the shadow of today's work a decade from now and say that we did for our country what we thought was necessary to assure the American dream to our children, to be able to say to Americans that you will have the same unique opportunity that your forebears had, then we must make sure that we have produced, and locked in the requirement of, a Government that is fiscally responsible. 
What we offer today and what we will be debating in the coming weeks is a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution which assures that this body and the other, as well as the President and his budget office, must operate in a fiscally sound and responsible way. It is what the American people say is their No. 1 issue. It must be our No. 1 issue. 
I am pleased today to join as a cosponsor in this critical amendment and look forward to the debate in the coming weeks as we say to the American people, `We have heard your message and we will fight to be fiscally responsible in the building and the maintaining of a federally balanced budget.' 
I yield back to the Senator from Utah.
