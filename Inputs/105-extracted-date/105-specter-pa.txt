Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had hoped to make this floor statement in advance of the vote, but I could not be here yesterday. So, I have asked for time this morning to state my reasons for voting against the omnibus appropriations bill. And I do so with a conflict of my own views because I think this bill provides very substantial funding for very many important projects. However, I decided to vote against the bill because of the change from regular order and existing procedures in the appropriations process. The Constitution gives the authority to 100 Members of the Senate and 435 Members of the House, but as the appropriations process went forward the final decisions were made by only four Members.

Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague, Senator Ashcroft, for asking for order. I would like to hear myself and am having some difficulty. 
As I was saying, Mr. President, notwithstanding the fact that this bill contains funding for many, many vital programs for America, I decided on balance to vote against it because it made such drastic changes in existing procedure where the Constitution gives to the Congress the authority to appropriate, 435 Members in the House and 100 Members in the Senate, and as the arrangements were finally worked out, critical decisions were made excluding the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, excluding the chairmen of the relevant subcommittees such as myself, with only the Speaker, the leader of the Democrats in the House, our distinguished majority leader, and the minority leader in the Senate. I think that is very, very problemsome. 
During the time allotted to me this morning I intend to summarize my views. 
Starting first with the accomplishments, it does provide for $83.3 billion in discretionary spending for the subcommittee which I chair which has jurisdiction over three major departments--the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Labor. There were some very important appropriations items included, such as a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health. My distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, the ranking member, and I worked very closely on this bill with our staffs, and I learned a long time ago that if you want to get something done in the Congress and the Senate, you have to cross party lines to do it. 
We added $2 billion to $13.6 billion in the National Institutes of Health budget, with a vision for the 21st century of conquering cancer, which takes the lives of 44,000 women a year from breast cancer, and the lives of many men from prostate cancer, conquering Alzheimer's, arthritis and Parkinson's. We appropriated $1.1 billion for LIHEAP, which is home energy assistance going principally to the poor, significantly to elderly people who only have the option of either heating or eating. We have $2.5 billion for substance abuse. We have appropriated $156 million to protect women from violence, an increase of $21 million over last year. 
For education programs, the total budget is $32.9 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion over last year. For student aid, so vital for American competitiveness worldwide and to improve quality of life for individuals, we have $9.3 billion, an increase of $369 million over last year, and for Head Start a total of $4.6 billion, an increase of $313 million. We have increased special education program funding to $5.1 billion, and we have put up some $1.2 billion for classroom size reduction, an objective I agree with, although we didn't get there the right way procedurally. 
The bill further provides for $1.7 billion for job training, very important; $1.3 billion for the Job Corps, $1.4 billion for dislocated workers, $564 million for mine safety, $871 million for summer youth jobs, a program which the House of Representatives had tried to totally eliminate. 
And why in the face of these important expenditures did I vote against the bill? Because this bill never came to the Senate floor from the subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education Appropriations. My staff and I worked on an expedited basis in August so that on our second day back, September 1, the subcommittee could vote it out. The full committee voted it out on September 3, but it never came up on the Senate floor. And similarly, the House of Representatives took only a small portion of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education bill up. 
As a result, when we did not follow the regular order and the customary process, we did not follow the constitutional direction and the direction which the Senate has adhered to for so many years. This was, I think, to the detriment of the bill, although so many important items have been funded, there could have been, I think, a better allocation had the people really responsible been involved throughout. 
When the chairman of the subcommittee is excluded from the final negotiations and the chairman of the full appropriations committee is excluded, you lose the impact and the experience of the people who have worked most closely on the bill. 
I would illustrate this point by noting what happened on October 9. The President had a press conference in the Rose Garden severely criticizing the Republican Congress on education, and I was asked to provide part of the response in a subsequent press conference. I did so by pointing out that the House-Senate conference had provided more money on education than the President had requested in his February budget. We had $31.8 billion, contrasted with the President's request for $31.2 billion, meaning that we put up $600 million more than the President asked for. Not unexpectedly, with the President's bully pulpit, his message carried the day and the congressional response was lost in the shuffle. 
Then we had the issue of reducing average classroom size by hiring teachers, where the President had requested $1.2 billion. What was not ever understood publicly was that those funds were to be provided by moneys from the tobacco settlement. However, there never was a tobacco settlement. The President and his administration never provided any alternative source of funding. Senator Harkin, my distinguished ranking member, and I and the rest of our subcommittee understood that, so we found $300 million for title I, which could have been used for reducing classroom size for next year. This was substantially more than that which could have been expended, and that, too, was lost in the shuffle. 
What I think is especially disconcerting is the fact that when we Republicans control both the Senate and the House, we should have been able to come to terms in September before the fiscal year ended and submitted bills to the White House, to the President, in regular order where the President would either have to sign them or veto them. Had we done this in regular order, I think, with the public debate focusing on the education issue, for example, the chances were excellent the President would not veto it when it would be understood the Congress had provided more than he had requested and that we had complied with much of his initiative classroom size reduction. 
But, when those bills were not presented until October and the only other option is closing up the Government, then the leverage is all with the President, and the Congress cannot really perform its appropriation and legislative function. 
The bills were not presented in September because of very strong disagreements on so many substantive matters which should have been handled by the authorizing committees. There was endless debate on whether there would be student testing, endless debate on organ transplants, endless debate on ergonomics--and we Republicans should have concluded those matters. We should have excluded the legislation, by and large, although realistically you can never exclude it all. And while we should not legislate on appropriations bills, some of that is necessarily done, but should not be done in a quantity to defeat our process of presenting these bills. 
In the conference we had on October 9, with representatives from the Office of Management and Budget, I raised the question about a disagreement in priorities of some $330 million out of the $32 billion bill--a relatively small part, about one percent. Was the President going to veto our bill over that amount of money, because of those differences in priorities? The Office of Management and Budget representatives said they did not know. I replied if they did not know, they ought not to be in the process, that we ought to be legislating. 
It would have been a very different outcome had we presented these bills to the President in September and had we focused on precisely what the Congress had done and where the areas of disagreement were, and on the fact that at that stage we had provided more money than the President had requested by $600 million, and that we had taken care of the issue on reduction of classroom size. 
We live in a society with many, many different views. What has been the strength of the institutions of the American Government has been the procedures which we have established for more than 200 years. Those procedures are for the subcommittee to report, the full committee to report, the matter to come to the floor of the Senate, for 100 Senators to be able to debate and offer amendments--and that was not done. And that was not done in the House. We did not have an actual House-Senate conference on our bill, although we met informally. The product is not what should have been done. We do not live in an oligarchy under the constitutional doctrine which governs our society. 
But, where you have these decisions made on $500 billion in expenditures and many, many substantive issues at the very last minute, it is an oligarchy. Mr. President, 535 of us have surrendered our power and our authority to a group of 4, and that is not the way the American Government is supposed to run. That has given disproportionate power, enormously disproportionate power, to the President because of the experience we had at the end of 1995 and the beginning of 1996 when the Government was closed and the Congress got the blame. 
What I have seen in the time I have been here is when there is blame, you can usually divide it 50/50, right down the middle, half to the Congress and half to the administration. If there is partisan blame, you can divide it right down the middle, half to the Republicans and half to the Democrats. I think the failure to follow regular order and our established procedures, the constitutional mandate and what we have developed as a matter of congressional practice, is very, very, very serious. I think it warrants a very, very strong protest vote, which I have cast. 
I was interested to hear the comments of the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who yesterday made a speech and, in more graphic terms than mine, called this a Frankenstein bill--it did not have a mother and a father--and said he was going to vote for it. A few minutes ago Senator Byrd approached me on the floor and said he decided to vote against it. I asked him why. He said he had persuaded himself. He went home last night, thought about his speech, decided he was right. He decided he was right on the Frankenstein part; he was wrong on the part to vote for the bill. 
I said I was delighted to hear that because of the high regard I have for Senator Byrd, also the high regard I have for Senator Santorum, who is presiding at the moment, my colleague from Pennsylvania, who also voted against this bill. We discussed it and he did not quite have the oligarchy in mind, but he agreed with the principle that the 535 of us ought not to cede our power to 4. 
It is not easy to get to the U.S. Senate. It is not easy to stay here. There is a lot of hard work that goes into what we have done. For example, Senator Santorum and I represent 12 million people and, in chairing the subcommittee on this $83 billion bill, I have given very, very serious consideration to all of these issues and I join him in thinking they should have been legislated in regular order. 
I, again, compliment my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, for his diligence and his work and his outstanding staff, Marsha Simon and Ellen Murray. My staff is second to none, with Mark Laisch, Jennifer Stiefel, Jack Chow, Mary Dietrich, Jim Sourwine. Most of all, `Senator' Bettilou Taylor--she is technically the clerk--who commented to me that she did not like my negative vote. Here she comes back on the floor. She heard her name mentioned. She thought it might have been interpreted that I was not for education and health care. I think my record is strong enough that my negative vote as a protest to the procedure will be understood in light of all the work we did on these education allocations and health care allocations. And Dan Renberg, who is my deputy chief of staff and legislative director, who is extraordinary in working with Bettilou in handling some 1,300 requests which come to our office, and about five times that many phone calls, and David Urban, my distinguished chief of staff, who also helps in making these legislative arrangements. 
So, it is with mixed emotions that I vote no because procedures and format are still the most important; that we follow regular order because we don t know about the quality of the next oligarchy of four which may seek control of the appropriations process.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to express my strong objections to the procedures which were followed on the omnibus appropriations bill, which contains the text of eight individual appropriations and authorizing provisions totaling nearly $500 billion in spending. 
The importance of this legislation stems from our Constitution, which provides in Article I, section 9 that, `no money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.' 
The regular order is for the 435 House members and the 100 Senators to consider the appropriations bills in sequence with floor action, conference reconciliation and then final action by each body before presentation to the President. This process, too, stems from the Constitutional directive in Article I, section 7 that a bill which has passed the House and Senate shall be presented to the President, who may sign it into law, or veto the bill and return it accordingly to the Congress for their reconsideration. 
This year, the final stages and key negotiations were carried on by only 4 elected members: the Majority Leader and Minority Leader in the Senate and the Speaker and Minority Leader of the Democrats in the House, with the participation of White House representatives. 
I chair the Appropriations Subcommittee which has jurisdiction for the bill funding the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education. Our bill did not reach the Senate floor for consideration by the full Senate. And, except for a small portion, our bill did not receive consideration by the full House of Representatives. Thus, the Senate could never formally convene a full-fledged conference with the House on the Labor, HHS, Education bill. Recognizing that our bill would be wrapped into an omnibus spending bill, we held informal conferences involving the House and Senate Chairmen and ranking minority members, but we were not present when the final, key decisions were made. 
In an early conference session on our bill, representatives of the Office of Management and Budget raised questions about approximately $330 million of the $32 billion designated for education programs in our bill. I asked these Administration officials whether that differnce, slightly more than 1 percent of the total, would produce a veto. 
The OMB representatives responded that they did not know the answer to my question. I then said if the difference would not produce a veto, then the matter really ought to be left to the House and Senate negotiators, who would reach their own conclusions as to the appropriate figures to be presented in the bill to the President. 
With the Republicans in control of both the House and Senate, it is my strongly held view that we had a responsibility to conclude the appropriations bills in September before the end of the fiscal year for presentation to the President. That agreement was not reached because of many pending military ancillary issues such as school testing, organ transplants, ergonomics, etc. Had we finished Congressional action on the appropriations bill on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, in September, for example, we could have then presented it to the President for his signature or veto with the issues crystallized. It is entirely possible that the President would not have vetoed the bill. 
However, when the bills were not ready for final consideration until October, the White House emerged with the most leverage because a failure to agree meant the government would shut down. 
On Friday, October 9, the President held an afternoon news conference in the Rose Garden criticizing the Republican Congress on education funding. I was asked to give a part of the Republican reply in a Capitol press conference, which I did, pointing out that the House-Senate subcommittee conferees had approved $31.8 billion for Fiscal Year 1999 discretionary education spending, which was $600 million over the President's budget request of $31.2 billion. 
As expected with the force of the bully pulpit, the President carried the day in the media arena with no Congressional reply receiving any significant attention. 
On the subject of adding teachers to reduce classroom size, earlier this year the President proposed paying for that $1.2 billion with proceeds from the tobacco settlement. Of course, there was no tobacco settlement legislation enacted and the Administration had no fallback proposal to cover the attendant shortfall in funding. 
Notwithstanding the absence of a tobacco settlement, my ranking member, Senator Harkin, and I had worked through the figures and allocated $300 million in additional federal funds for title one which could be used for school districts to hire new teachers and reduce the average number of children assigned to each classroom teacher. We were advised the budgetary outlays would be $50 million in the first year, which was more than enough for the first year's funding and could be afforded within the existing Subcommittee allocation. 
Again, all of that was lost in the last minute shuffle with the President criticizing the Congress without a factual foundation. 
Had these issues on education, for example, been handled in a timely fashion in September with presentment of a Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill to the President, he would have had to articulate his views in a public forum to justify a veto. The result likely would have been entirely different. 
It is my hope that we will not repeat this year's process. I firmly believe that if the people of America are given the opportunity to understand precisely what is happening, they will demand that we follow regular order in the appropriations process as set forth in the Constitution and the long-established practices of congressional legislative action.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to honor a special member of my staff who is retiring from government service at the end of the 105th Congress. 
Mary Louise Sinclair has served with loyalty and with distinction in the United States Senate family for nearly 36 years. During the course of her service in the Senate, Mary Louise has worked for some notable members of this body. She has worked for Senator Everett Dirksen as a secretary from 1962 to 1970. She then joined the staff of Senator Robert Taft as the office manager and secretary, where she stayed for his full term until 1977. My fellow Pennsylvanian, the late Senator John Heinz, was also privileged to have Mary Louise on his staff as a special assistant for a remarkable 13 years from 1978 to 1992, and since 1993, Mary Louise has served with distinction as my Executive Secretary. 
Through her dedication and diligence, Mary Louise has enabled me to maximize my efficiency to ensure that I am in the best position to represent Pennsylvania. For that, my staff, my constituents, my family and I are very grateful. 
I applaud her service and offer her, on behalf of my Senate colleagues, our goodwill and best wishes upon her retirement.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to thank the chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee for having included in this legislation funding for the Drexel University Intelligent Infrastructure Institute. I have been pleased to have worked with Drexel for several years on obtaining funding to establish the institute, which will focus on the link between intelligent transportation systems and transportation infrastructure. Drexel has teamed up with the Delaware River Port Authority to study that agency's infrastructure, which includes four major bridges that provide critical links in the east coast corridor. Congress has previously appropriated $750,000 toward this project and authorized establishment of the institute in the TEA-31 legislation enacted earlier this year. 
It is my understanding that it is the intent of the managers for the Transportation Appropriations bill that the $500,000 provided for the institute shall be made available pursuant to the provisions of section 5118 of TEA-21, which specifically authorizes the establishment of the Institute.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I would like to speak for a moment on the importance of our veterans and their service to this nation. As you know, November 11th is Veterans Day, the day we honor those who have served in the United States Armed Forces. 
For over two hundred years, the democratic form of government that so many of us take for granted has survived and prospered in an increasingly dangerous world. The fulfillment of our Declaration of Independence's tenets of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness was achieved through the genius and drive of our main resource--our citizens. But that genius and drive could never have occurred without the sacrifice and security provided by those who bore the brunt of our defenses and even gave their lives to this cause. From the early days of our isolated republic to today's challenges as a global leader, this country has trusted and relied on the unwavering protection provided by our men and women in military uniform. 
Veterans Day provides us an opportunity to reflect upon and recognize those who have served in the world's finest military. We will honor those who have fought in wartime and protected our nation in peacetime; those who have served on the battlefields of the world and in the communities that make up this vast and prosperous nation. As Abraham Lincoln so eloquently articulated in his Gettysburg Address, it is our solemn obligation `to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced . . . and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.' We should remember these powerful words and continue to do the best that we are able to meet the expectations of those who have guaranteed our freedom. 
I have long been impressed with so many veterans' commitment to public affairs long after their military service. My frequent meetings with veterans in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania reinforces my view that they are America's finest citizens whose duty did not end with active military service. They remain continued supporters and activists in reminding the U.S. Congress and, indeed, the American people of the need for a strong national defense. It is this lifetime commitment to service that should be recognized on Veterans Day. 
Since the Senate is not expected to be in session on Veterans Day, I would like to extend my appreciation to all veterans of the United States Armed Forces. To quote Abraham Lincoln again, during his second Inaugural Address he said, `let us strive on to finish the work we are in; . . . to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan. . . .' November 11th will be a day of recognition to the service of America's 25 million veterans. I am certain that my colleagues will join me in thanking all veterans for their remarkable legacy of commitment to honor, duty, and country.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment about the budget process and the status of events now pending between the Congress and the Administration. 
We have come to a stage on appropriations where so many decisions are left, in the final analysis, to negotiations which involve only four Members of Congress and now the Chief of Staff of the President's administration, which I believe is far removed from the regular order of the United States Congress and the regular order as envisioned by the Constitution where the Congress legislates, presents bills to the President, and the President either signs or vetoes those bills. 
We have, as we all know, 100 Members of the Senate and 435 Members of the House of Representatives. And it is my view that, if unconstitutional, it is certainly an unwise de facto delegation of power to four Members of Congress: The Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, the Speaker, and the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives. 
My bill is illustrative. I chair the appropriations subcommittee which has jurisdiction of three major Departments: The Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Labor. And my staff and I worked during the month of August, a recess month, so that when we came back into session on August 31 we would be prepared, as we were on September 1, to have the subcommittee act. The full committee then acted on September 3 in an effort to have this complex and important bill considered early on by the Senate. 
The bill never came to the Senate floor because of other pressing business and candidly, because the bill was so controversial that it would likely be tied up in matters which might not be resolved. However, I believe that had these issues been debated on the Senate floor, I think that they would have had chance, a realistic chance. Ultimately, with enough time and effort, we could have prevailed. Similarly, in the House of Representatives there was never floor consideration to the legislation covering these three important departments. 
So the subcommittee chairman and the ranking members met and tried to work out many of the points of contention. The matters have never been considered on the floor of the Senate where under our procedures Senators have the right to offer amendments, the right to modify figures in the regular legislative consideration. 
We are going to have to take a hard look at our procedures when we reconvene next January so that we go back to the regular order and to the process under which this body, the Senate, considers the legislation we have handled on the floor and then in the conference report and then present it to the President for his signature or for his veto, as he exercises his Presidential judgment. 
We had a conference last Friday with representatives from the Office of Management and Budget and the chairmen of the Appropriations Committees from both Houses, as well as the chairmen of the subcommittees and ranking members. At that time we were considering an objection which the President had raised to the appropriations bill covering education. The President had just had a rose garden news conference and was very, very critical of Congress for failing to meet his demands, his requests, his priorities on education. 
I was asked to participate in a responsive news conference which, unlike the President's power of the bully pulpit, received virtually no attention. The facts are these: The President has requested for education $31,185,302,000; on Friday the House-Senate Conference Committee had come to a figure of $31,832,358,000. Rounding off the numbers, the President was at $31.2 billion and the House-Senate conference was at $31.8 billion. We were $600 million over the President's figure. It led me at that news conference to comment that the President either did not know what the figures were or was negotiating not in good faith in representing that the Congress had not met his requests for an education funding figure. 
A further controversy developed, and I believe is still pending, although those negotiations are ongoing. And minute by minute we do not know whether agreements are made or not until we hear their final report. The President asked for $1.1 billion for classroom size. The President proposed paying for that item with the proceeds from the tobacco settlement, except there never was a tobacco settlement and we never had those proceeds to work with. 
My subcommittee had anticipated that problem and had, in the report which we filed, provided for reduction in classroom size to meet what the President considered a priority. We agreed with him that it was a priority. We allocated some $300 million for that effort. According to the information presented in our conference, the maximum expenditure for the next fiscal year would have been $50 million. So we had adequately taken care of the President's priority and we had more than enough funding to proceed for the first year. 
It was our concern that the congressional authorizing committees had not taken up the item, which should be done in the context where we saw there was adequate funding. Had we had the tobacco proceeds, I think a good bit more attention would have been paid to this. When the funding did not come through, the subcommittee made its best efforts. I believe the facts are illustrated on these items, which were the bones of contention. The subcommittee had provided more funding for education than the President had requested, and it made an appropriate allocation for classroom reduction size. Congress had done its job on education. 
It is obvious that when the President speaks from that bully pulpit he may even get more attention than when a Senator addresses the same subject on the Senate floor, seen by very few people on C-SPAN2. But at least we do what we can to establish the record for the propriety of our congressional action. 
The business of having 535 elected Members of the Congress delegate authority to four individual Members, short-circuiting our process, is not in the national interest. 
One of the items which has been under consideration in the subcommittee has been a complex question of organ transplants. The subcommittee has adopted the recommendation of the administration, put forward by Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, to establish regulations issued by her Department. We held a hearing on the subject and tried to come to grips with that issue. A differing point of view was put forth by the House of Representatives. 
I concede that while the House advocates had parochial interests of their State, I, too, had an interest in Pennsylvania on this issue. Looking at the broader national aspects, it really is a matter to be decided by the medical experts. I think that was provided for in the regulations proposed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary had no parochial interest and was speaking for the national interest. If the Secretary was wrong, that is a matter which ought to be decided by the authorizing committee. It ought not to be left to the appropriators. 
That is only illustrative of many, many riders we have where the appropriators are called upon to decide very, very complex questions which ought to be resolved after hearings, analysis, floor debate, and a decision on what is public policy. They really are not issues to be decided by how much money ought to be allocated to a specific line, which is the function of appropriations. 
It is my hope that these procedures will be corrected when the Congress reconvenes next January, to find a way to return to regular order and to have these issues considered by the full Senate, considered in a Conference Committee, and presented to the President. 
When we had our conference last Friday, I raised the question head on with members of the Office of Management and Budget where this education item was a matter for veto. He had some difference of opinion of some $330 million, which is not insignificant, but is not enormous on a $32 billion budget. The representative of the administration couldn't answer the question. If we had passed a bill and submitted it to the President, I think he would not have vetoed. My instinct is if we passed a bill and submitted it to the President, the funding figure which he wished for, classroom size reduction, which has now been conceded by the congressional negotiators, but it left open the issue of whether it would be decided by the States and local government or decided by the Federal Government, with the President pressing to have a mandate from the Federal Government operated out of Washington instead of leaving it to local government. 
Here again, I think the President would not have exercised his veto, or at least had we followed regular order and the constitutional procedure without having the President in the negotiations on the appropriations bill--where he ought not to be, his representative ought not to be--we would have had a determination as to whether it rose to the magnitude of a Presidential veto. 
Our institutions have been well served, as we know, when we follow constitutional procedures, when you follow regular order on what has been established. I do believe that these shortcuts are not in the public interest and we ought to return to the tried and tested ways of the appropriations process.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have seen the issue of hate crimes again tragically before the American people with a horrendous event in Laramie, WY, on October 6, just last week, where a young man, Matthew Shepard, was kidnaped, robbed, severely beaten, and left tied to a fence in freezing weather. He died 5 days later from his wounds. 
Two men have been charged with the murder. It appears that the attack was motivated at least in part by an antigay bias. Police have stated that while robbery was the main motive for the attack, that Mr. Shepard was apparently chosen as a victim because he was gay. 
It has been reported by the investigators that the two suspects lured Mr. Shepard from the bar by stating that they, too, were gay and wanted to meet with him. The girlfriend of one of the two suspects has stated that Shepard was targeted because he had flirted with the suspect earlier that evening and allegedly embarrassed him. 
The issue of hate crimes was very much a national focus months ago, on June 7 of 1998, when Mr. James Byrd, Jr., an African-American, was kidnaped and killed by being dragged from the back of a pickup truck. Three white men have been charged with the murder. The evidence indicates that there was racial motivation for the attack. Authorities have stated that all three suspects were white supremacists and had white supremacist tattoos on their bodies. All three were identified as belonging to the Ku Klux Klan and the Confederate Knights of America while serving in prison. Racist literature was seized from the home shared by the suspects. 
The current hate crime legislation was deemed inadequate on the murder of Mr. Byrd because the victim was attacked in a way where he was not seeking to exercise a federally protected right. 
On November 13, 1997, Senator Kennedy, Senator Wyden, and I introduced the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which has not moved forward. It is my view that there is no place in America for hate. There is just no place in America for hate. There is no place for hatred of African-Americans, hatred of Asians, and there is no place for hatred of Jews, Muslims, gays, or anyone else. That is antithetical to America, antithetical to the concepts of the melting pot. We see around the world what has happened in places like Bosnia, and we see what has happened in Kosovo, and we have seen what has happened in Africa. But in the United States, there is no place for hate. 
I have asked both leaders in the Congress and the President to push to have this legislation included in the final Omnibus Appropriations Act. I know it is difficult to do. Let's see what happens on it. There ought to be a very, very strong stand taken against hate. Gays ought to be included in the protection, and we ought not to have the highly technical, legalistic concepts of the exercise of a federally protected right. 
I served for 8 years as district attorney of Philadelphia and 4 years as assistant district attorney before that, and crime was horrendous. But when hate is added to the crime, it becomes an intolerable circumstance, something which should be acted upon by the Congress of the United States. The legislation has been modified to arrive at a situation where local authorities would call for Federal assistance. I am not sure that is a wise provision, because so frequently we find local authorities unwilling to act, and that is really the reason for the necessity for Federal action. But the legislation has been modified in a number of important respects to try to give an impetus for enactment. We should not await the next tragedy on hate--whether it is directed to someone of Asian ancestry, or someone who is Jewish, or a Muslim, or a gay, or an African-American--to motivate us to take the appropriate steps and be very, very tough in the response and prosecution of those offenses. 
Mr. President, in the absence of anyone else seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to thank Chairman Bond for his inclusion of funding within the Economic Development Initiatives account for three important projects in Pittsburgh, Wilkes-Barre, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that I requested. 
The conference report also includes $2 million for the City of Pittsburgh to redevelop the LTV site in Hazelwood, Pennsylvania. These funds can be used by the city to clean up and prepare the site for eventual reuse. One possibility being contemplated in the area is an effort to attract the Sun Oil Company to build a new coke facility which create hundreds of new jobs. 
I am pleased that we have been able to increase the level of funding in the bill from $750,000 to $1 million for the downtown revitalization project in Wilkes-Barre which is also a top priority for Mayor Tom McGroarty and Congressman Paul Kanjorski. 
I am also pleased that the conference report includes $50,000 for a project in Central and South Philadelphia, which is plagued with an average annual family income of $7,600, a 45 percent unemployment rate, and a 50 percent high school drop-out rate. These funds are intended to provide initial resources for the development of a job training and business center to generate employment in this section of Philadelphia. The renewal project is spearheaded by Universal Community Homes, a not-for-profit community development corporation which has a strong presence in the city, and which has received grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development for housing and other initiatives which are geared toward improving the quality of life for low-income families. In January of this year, I had the opportunity to visit Universal Community Homes to tour their facilities. More importantly, I met with individuals who directly benefit from the programs and services delivered by Universal Community Homes. Members of the media and community leaders were also present to bring to my attention that the South Central Philadelphia sections of the city are in critical need of a job training and business center. 
I take this opportunity to clarify with Chairman Bond that it is the conferees' intent that Universal Community Homes is the appropriate applicant for the EDI grant for Central and South Philadelphia.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, next month our nation acknowledges the more than 4 million Americans who suffer from Alzheimer's disease and the 19 million who are their caregivers. National Alzheimer's month is a time to reflect on those who are afflicted as well as those who are dedicating their lives to eradicating this disease. 
I bring to your attention one of those who is committed to creating a world without Alzheimer's. His name is Dr. Steven DeKosky and since 1990, he has been an the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine where among other things, he directs the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center funded by the National Institute on Aging. Dr. DeKosky's accomplishments are enormous as reflected in his curriculum vitae, which is some 36 pages long. If I tried to list all of his achievements it would fill dozens of pages of the Congressional Record. In the interests of the taxpayers, I'll mention only a few of Dr. DeKosky's contributions. 
As a renowned Alzheimer researcher, clinician and teacher, Dr. DeKosky is dedicated to finding answers to the Alzheimer's puzzle. To this end, he is active in basic and clinical research. His basic research is on the structural and neurochemical changes in human brains with dementia. His clinical research focuses on four key areas. One is to find ways of diagnosing the disease more effectively and differentiating it from other related diseases. A second area involves neuroimaging, which helps to confirm other diagnostic techniques, but also opens `windows' to the brain to enable scientists to understand the disease better. A third area of study, and one that is offering very exciting possibilities for treatment, is the assessment of genetic risk factors in Alzheimer's. Finally, he is involved in clinical trials to assess new medications for Alzheimer's disease. 
Dr. DeKosky is active in the American Academy of Neurology and the American Neurological Association. The latter organization honored him with its `Presidential Award' in 1988. He is listed in `The Best Doctors in America.' He serves on the editorial boards of the `Archives of Neurology' and the `Alzheimer Disease and Associated Disorders: An International Journal.' He also received a Teacher Investigator Development Award from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. 
Despite his involvement in dozens of research projects and other academic pursuits, Dr. DeKosky contributes vast amounts of time as a volunteer to the Alzheimer cause. He currently chairs the national Alzheimer's Association's Medical and Scientific Advisory Council and is a member of the board of the Alzheimer's Association. He chairs the Professional Advisory Board of the Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association and was a founding member of the Lexington-Blue Grass Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association. 
Dr. DeKosky has a special gift as a communicator of science. Whether in the classroom or speaking to groups of family members in the community, Dr. DeKosky has a knack for making the complex seem simple. He expresses the enthusiasm and hope created by scientific research in Alzheimer's, which is offering promise to Americans of all ages that their future may not be blighted by this dread disease. And, he has a sense of humor and a healthy dose of humility, which allows him to `connect' to those to whom he speaks. 
Mr. President, I believe it is important to acknowledge the unsung heroes who are working tirelessly in laboratories and in the clinic to make our world less disease-prone. Dr. Steven DeKosky is one of those exemplary citizens who through his daily efforts is bringing about a better tomorrow.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with more that 4 million Americans suffering from Alzheimer's disease at a cost to our society of more than $100 billion annually, it is time we take a moment to reflect on the work of those who are dedicating their energies to helping do something about this terrible disease. 
One of those people is Ellen Berliner. Ms. Berliner, who lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, took care of her husband with Alzheimer's disease for 13 years. For those of us who have not been a caregiver for an Alzheimer patient, it is difficult to comprehend what the experience is like. It has been described as the `36 hour day' or the `endless funeral' because the demands are greater and more stressful than what most of us can deal with in a normal 24 hour day, and the losses and emotional strain are enormous. Ms. Berliner, like so many other Americans, stepped up to the challenge of caregiving and performed courageously out of love for her husband and her family. 
But, Ms. Berliner didn't stop there. Drawing on her pain and struggles as a caregiver, she decided to do something to help others. In 1988, she helped create the Greater Pittsburgh chapter of the Alzheimer's Association and became its founding Board President. In the past ten years, she has contributed more than 16,000 hours of volunteer service to the chapter and to the families in the greater Pittsburgh area. She has developed support groups and services to help families. She has been active in advocacy to help improve the policies that affect the lives of families and people suffering from Alzheimer's. And, she has stuffed envelopes and made phone calls to help raise the necessary funds to support the work of this important charity. 
Ms. Berliner has a long history of community service. In 1974 she co-founded the Women's Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh. The center, which provides a safe haven for battered women, was one of the first in the nation. For her work with battered women and for other community services, Ms. Berliner was nominated for the Jefferson Award of the American Institute for Public Service in 1992. In 1996, Ms. Berliner received the `New Person Award' given by the Thomas Merton Center for People Over 70. The award is given in appreciation of lifelong works for peace and social justice. 
Mr. President, I bring Ms. Berliner to the attention of this body because I believe we should shine a light on the good works of our citizens, heroic work really, that is done without personal gain and with no desire for public recognition. Our nation has grown strong because of people like Ellen Berliner who use their own time and resources to make life a little better for the rest of us. 
So, I say `thank you' to Ms. Ellen Berliner for helping the people of Pittsburgh deal with the devastation caused by Alzheimer's disease, and for being a role model to her peers and to future generations.

Mr. SPECTER. At the outset, I congratulate my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, for his leadership on this important measure, along with Senator Lieberman and Senator Coats. 
This is a very important piece of legislation, which now appears to be near fruition, with joint action by the House of Representatives. This legislation, the International Religious Freedom Act, constitutes a very firm stand by the United States against religious persecution worldwide. A bipartisan group of Senators have spearheaded this effort, and the outcome is one in which the Senate can be proud. 
The rockbed of America is religious freedom. That is the reason that the pilgrims came to this country, to the settlements in Virginia in 1607 and in Massachusetts with the pilgrims in 1620. That was also the reason that my father, Harry Specter, came to this country in 1911 at the age of 18, and my mother, Lillie Shanin Specter, came to this country at the age of 5 with her family which had lived in a small town on the Russian-Polish border. Freedom of religion is the heart of the first amendment, the provisions for religious freedom. 
We have seen worldwide unspeakable religious persecution. We have seen Catholic clerics mistreated and tortured in China. We have seen Christians sold into slavery in the Sudan. We have seen the risk of the death penalty in Egypt and in Saudi Arabia for those of the Islam faith who seek to convert to Christianity. 
This legislation is a very forceful statement by the United States of America that religious persecution is intolerable wherever it exists, whether it is against Christians, whether it is against Jews, or whether it is against those of the Islam faith, Buddhist, or whatever the religious persuasion may be, it is intolerable. This issue, as I have already noted, goes to my own personal roots. I was motivated to act for legislative relief by a distinguished American named Michael Horowitz, who came to see me in early 1997 and said that there had been enormous support from the international Christian community to protect Soviet Jewry, and that there ought to be a firm, responsive action by those of the Jewish faith to try to help on the issue of persecution of Christians. It soon expanded beyond persecution of Christians to people of any religious persuasion. 
I have been working in the Senate on the issue of religious persecution for several years now. At the end of the 104th Congress, I introduced Senate Resolution 283, which detailed the need for quick, decisive action and called upon the President to appoint a White House advisor on religious persecution. After that, I worked with Senators Nickles, Nunn, and Coats on a broader Senate resolution, S. Con. Res. 71, which included my provisions on a White House Senior Advisor on religious persecution and expressed the sense of the Senate regarding persecution of Christians worldwide. S. Con. Res. 71, which I cosponsored, passed the Senate by voice vote but there was insufficient time remaining in the 104th Congress to secure passage in the House. 
In collaboration with Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia, on May 21, 1997, I introduced legislation in the Senate, S. 772, and Congressman Wolf introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives. We introduced a bill that directly confronted the horrendous situation in many countries. This legislation targeted those countries that engaged in the most egregious acts of persecution such as torture, slavery and forcible acts of conversion. The legislation was passed in the House of Representatives on May 14, 1998 by a vote of 375-41. The matter has been under consideration by the Senate. The provisions of Senate bill 772, which I introduced, had been criticized, or concerns were raised because of the sanctions which had been imposed. 
There is a widespread concern in Congress--and in the Senate, at least among some Senators--that the sanctions are counterproductive and that they ought not to be entertained. 
My own personal view is that the sanctions would have been appropriate. But I think it is worthwhile to take two-thirds of a loaf, 70 percent of a loaf, I think substantially more than half a loaf, in the accommodation which we are making here in the legislation which has been introduced today. 
Margaret Chase Smith, a distinguished Senator from Maine, articulated a very important concept talking about the principle of compromise as opposed to the compromise of principle. And in the legislation which is being advanced today there is not a compromise of principle, but we are making accommodations to put this legislation through. 
Over the past 2 years, I have conducted four hearings throughout Pennsylvania to hear from panelists who have witnessed or experienced personally the horrors of religious persecution. These hearings were held in the Pittsburgh area, the Harrisburg area, Allentown/Reading area and the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area. In addition, I have had several meetings with evangelical leaders and leaders of missionary organizations who have been striving to expose those governments and other organizations that tolerate or perpetuate serious, physical acts of religious persecution against their own population. 
It is clear from my meetings with religious leaders in Pennsylvania that there are regions of the world where the situation is particularly abhorrent. In China, the government distinguishes between `Patriotic' Catholic and Protestant churches that are endorsed by the government and the more than 50 million `House' church Christian Churches. The Chinese government recognizes officially only the Patriotic churches. Members of the House churches--those who refuse to register in a state religion, or who remain faithful to the Vatican--are regularly imprisoned for having bibles or holding worship services without permission. 
Just over two years ago in August 1996, I traveled to China and met with Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen to express my strong concerns about religious persecution in his country. The next month, however, the Chinese Government released a statement warning the Chinese people that open exercise of their religion could result in harsh retribution. This Summer, when President Clinton traveled to China there was real hope that the Chinese Government would begin to reverse decades of religious intolerance and persecution. Sadly, recent reports indicate that the situation has improved little. 
This past January, I traveled to the Mideast and Africa to gather evidence on such practices in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Egypt and neighboring countries. I met with religious leaders and governmental officials in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Yemen. I had wanted to visit Sudan to investigate persecution of Christians by the fundamentalist Islamic Sudanese government, but was told by the State Department that Sudan was unsafe for American delegations. I did meet with the Sudanese government-in-exile in neighboring Eritrea, and discussed reports of Sudanese persecution with His Holiness Abuna Paulos, the Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and with the leadership of the Ethiopian Supreme Islamic Council in Addis Ababa. My fact finding corroborated the widespread reports of bias, mistreatment and persecution of religious minorities in these countries. It is now a well known fact that the government of Sudan has supported a campaign of forced enslavement and conversion of the Christian population in southern Sudan. Literally thousands of Christian children have been taken as slaves in the last six years. The government of Sudan permits the torture and forcible conversion of Christian worshipers. 
I heard reports from Egyptian evangelicals who cited cases of eight and nine months in jail for Muslims who sought conversion to Christianity. Many of them complained about the long time it took to secure official permission to build churches. Eritrean Christians confirmed claims of Sudanese children being sold into slavery. They attributed it to profiteering by militia as part of the booty of war. One Eritrean Christian commented on Sudanese government action in closing churches in 1997. 
Egyptian President Mubarak and Saudi Arabian Intelligence Director Prince Turki told me that public intolerance toward non-Muslim religions springs from the Koran. Conversion from Islam to Christianity or any other religion carries the death penalty under Muslim laws that are based on teachings of the Koran. 
In Egypt, I talked to the Copts, saw situations where religious persecution was present. Congressman Wolf and I have talked about being criticized in the Egyptian press for our advocacy of religious freedom around the world. As the saying goes, you can tell a man or woman by their friends. And you can tell a man or woman by their enemies as well. Perhaps it is a mark of distinction to have been criticized, as Congressman Wolf and I had been in the Egyptian press, for articulating and pushing the principles of religious freedom. 
In Saudi Arabia, I talked to Christians and Jews who had been persecuted there, and was outraged to find that if you were a Christian in Saudi Arabia, you could not have a Christmas tree in your window, which could be viewed from the outside; that the Jewish men and women who are stationed there in the American forces did not want to wear their dog tags, their identification, because the indication of being Jewish was a source of possible reprisal. 
I heard conflicting statements in Saudi Arabia about whether the death penalty is actually imposed on conversion. In some cases there is question about whether individuals are put to death solely because of their faith, or if other charges are involved. There is no doubt, however, that the religious police in Saudi Arabia are very repressive against Christians. 
While in Saudi Arabia, I visited a tent city right in the center of the desert where we have 5,000 American soldiers who are there to protect the Saudis, living under I think intolerable conditions, where they cannot have an open exercise of their religious faith, be they Jewish or Christian. 
From my discussions with foreign leaders and religious minorities, it was clear that the introduction of the Specter-Wolf bill has had a beneficial impact by raising the issue's visibility. For example, Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, Vatican Ambassador to Ethiopia, complimented the proposed legislation for raising the level of dialogue, adding that, if it were enacted with a `little bite,' then so much the better. 
I think this measure goes a long way in articulating the basic principles of religious freedom, which we prize so highly in America, and that we are exporting a fundamental American value. The bill I think would have been preferable to have sanctions. But it would be impossible to move it through the Senate. So we are taking a very substantial step forward in the legislation as it is currently framed. The legislation brings fair and honest fact finding to the situation of religious minorities around the world. It provides the necessary balance of respecting cultural differences and promoting religious tolerance throughout the world. The legislation provides for a strong, independent commission that can make recommendations based on honest facts. 
I want to compliment and commend especially New York Times columnist A.M. Rosenthal, who has had a very profound influence on the formulation of this legislation. You see his articles from time to time, or you see a column from time to time, and there may be some impact. But Mr. Rosenthal has published column after column and has brought to the American people through the impressive op-ed page, or editorial page of the New York Times, discussions of the problems of religious persecution around the world. I think it has had significant effect in moving this legislation forward. 
In our discussions, again, I compliment our distinguished colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, for his leadership, along with Senator Lieberman. Senator Coats has been a tower of strength. There have been a number of kudos and compliments to Senator Coats as he leaves the U.S. Senate. However many compliments there have been, they are insufficient, because he has made a tremendous contribution to the U.S. Senate. But I believe that this bill will be a tribute, in effect, to Senator Dan Coats and I think to all of those who have worked so hard for its enactment. 
Mr. President, how much of my 20 minutes remains?

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to make a brief comment, on the appropriations process, and to express some concerns which I have about the procedures where some of the legislative proposals have not been considered in regular order and in due course--specifically, the legislation on the appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. 
In articulating these concerns, I understand the tremendous pressures which have been presented to leadership to conclude our session with the target date of October 9. 
The Constitution gives to the Congress the authority and responsibility of the appropriations process. And that customarily proceeds with action in the appropriations subcommittee, then the appropriations full committee, then the full body of the Senate, where Senators have an opportunity to comment on the legislation and to offer amendments, and then, when acted upon, goes to a conference in the House of Representatives, which has followed the same pattern--consideration of the subcommittee, full committee, and by the House, and then the conference committee. 
That process has been short-circuited this year without having the legislation, the appropriations bill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, come to the Senate floor. We have sought a conference with our distinguished House Members--Congressman Porter, who chairs the House equivalent of the subcommittee, and Congressman Obey, the ranking minority leader--along with Senator Tom Harkin, my distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee. 
It would be my hope that as we proceed with the business of the Senate in future years, we would be able to proceed in regular order so that the Senate has an opportunity to consider the measure, Senators offer amendments, and go through the regular procedure on the House-Senate conference.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this legislation is introduced to correct a legislative inequity that has adversely affected one of my constituents, Mrs. Vicki Reid of Dauphin, Pennsylvania. 
At the time of his death in Operation Desert Shield, Captain Frederick Reid was serving as a United States Air Force pilot. The Air Force had authorized an Aviator Continuation Pay contract contingent upon his continuing to serve in the Air Force. Unfortunately, on October 10, 1990, Captain Reid was killed during a flight training operation. 
The Defense Department policy at the time was that one's death precluded receiving the continuation pay. Congress responded by enacting the Mack Amendment, under which families of pilots killed in action during Operation Desert Storm are entitled to the deceased pilot's Aviator Continuation Pay. This provision of the fiscal year 1992 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 102-172) stipulates that in order to collect the Aviator Continuation Pay, the pilot must have died during Operation Desert Storm (on or after January 17, 1991), but excludes those pilots killed in Operation Desert Shield. 
By letter to me dated August 3, 1998 from Under Secretary Rudy De Leon, the Department of Defense has confirmed that Captain Reid was the only U.S. Air Force pilot killed in Operation Desert Shield who was entitled to Aviator Continuation Pay and that approximately $58,000 of Captain Reid's Aviator Continuation Pay was unpaid at the time of his death. In a September 11, 1998 letter to me, the Air Force has expressed its support for an extension of the Mack Amendment to cover the Reid case. 
While private relief legislation is a last resort to be used sparingly by the Congress, Captain Reid's service and dedication to his country are laudatory. Had he died only a few months later, his widow would have been justly compensated. Accordingly, I am introducing this bill today.

Mr. SPECTER. It has been cleared on the other side of the aisle. It provides for aviator continuation pay for Air Force personnel killed in Operation Desert Shield. It is for a Pennsylvania constituent, as I understand it, the only one who has not been so compensated.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation designed to permit certain youths (those exempt from attending school) between the ages of 14 and 18 to work in sawmills under special safety conditions and close adult supervision. While I realize that this legislation cannot be enacted so late in the session, I believe it is important to introduce the bill and promote a serious discussion on this issue. 
As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I have strongly supported increased funding for the enforcement of the important child safety protections contained in the Fair Labor Standards Act. I also believe, however, that accommodation must be made for youths who are exempt from compulsory school-attendance laws after the eighth grade. It is extremely important that youths who are exempt from attending school be provided with access to jobs and apprenticeships in areas that offer employment where they live. 
The need for access to popular trades is demonstrated by the Amish community. Earlier this week I toured an Amish sawmill in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and had the opportunity to meet with some of my Amish constituency. They explained that while the Amish once made their living almost entirely by farming, they have increasingly had to expand into other occupations as farmland disappears in many areas due to pressure from development. As a result, many of the Amish have come to rely more and more on work in sawmills to make their living. The Amish culture expects youth upon the completion of their education at the age of 14 to begin to learn a trade that will enable them to become productive members of society. In many areas work in sawmills is one of the major occupations available for the Amish, whose belief system limits the types of jobs they may hold. Unfortunately, these youths are currently prohibited by law from employment in this industry until they reach the age of 18. This prohibition threatens both the religion and lifestyle of the Amish. 
The House has already passed by a voice vote H.R. 4257, introduced by my distinguished colleague, Representative Joseph R. Pitts, which is similar to the bill I am introducing today. I am aware that concerns to H.R. 4257 exist: safety issues have been raised by the Department of Labor and Constitutional issues have been raised by the Department of Justice. I have addressed these concerns in my legislation. 
Under my legislation youths would not be allowed to operate power machinery, but would be restricted to performing activities such as sweeping, stacking wood, and writing orders. My legislation requires that the youths must be protected from wood particles or flying debris and wear protective equipment, all while under strict adult supervision. The Department of Labor must monitor these safeguards to insure that they are enforced. 
The Department of Justice has stated that H.R. 4257 would `raise serious concerns' under the Establishment Clause. The House measure confers benefits only to a youth who is a `member of a religious sect or division thereof whose established teachings do not permit formal education beyond the eighth grade.' By conferring the `benefit' of working in a sawmill only to the adherents of certain religions, the Department argues that the bill appears to impermissibly favor religion to `irreligion.' In drafting my legislation, I attempted to overcome such an objection by conferring permission to work in sawmills to all youths who `are exempted from compulsory education laws after the eighth grade.' Indeed, I think a broader focus is necessary to create a sufficient range of vocational opportunities for all youth who are legally out of school and in need of vocational opportunities. 
I also believe that the logic of the Supreme Court's 1972 decision in Wisconsin v. Yoder supports my bill. Yoder held that Wisconsin's compulsory school attendance law requiring children to attend school until the age of 16 violated the Free Exercise clause. The Court found that the Wisconsin law imposed a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion by the Amish since attending school beyond the eighth grade `contravenes the basic religious tenets and practices of the Amish faith.' I believe a similar argument can be made with respect to Amish youth working in sawmills. As their population grows and their subsistence through an agricultural way of life decreases, trades such as sawmills become more and more crucial to the continuation of their lifestyle. Barring youths from the sawmills denies these youths the very vocational training and path to self-reliance that was central to the Yoder Court's holding that the Amish do not need the final two years of public education. 
At this stage in the legislative process, so close to the end of the 105th Congress, passage of my bill requires a unanimous consent agreement. I have already been notified that there are Senators who would object to such an agreement, and I do understand that a measure of this nature cannot be rushed through the Senate. Nevertheless, I offer my legislation in the hope of beginning a dialogue on this important issue.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation responding to the critical steel import crisis along with my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, who serves with me as co-chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, Senator Hollings, and Senator Santorum. Our bill is entitled the `Trade Fairness Act of 1998' because it would amend the Trade Act of 1974 to remove statutory provisions which put our domestic industry at a significant disadvantage compared to their foreign competitors. Specifically, this bill makes technical corrections to the so-called `Section 201' provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 to harmonize our laws with international laws administered by the World Trade Organization. 
While I know it is very late in the 105th legislative session, we intend that the introduction of this legislation will demonstrate our bipartisan commitment to responding to the current steel import crisis. Further, this should send a strong signal to the administration that it is high time that we respond. 
Yesterday, Senator John D. Rockefeller, Congressman Ralph Regula and Congressman Jim Oberstar, and I met with representatives of the Clinton administration, specifically Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Commerce Secretary William Daley, United States Trade Representative Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky and National Economic Council Advisor Gene Sperling, to discuss the steel import issue. At that meeting, representatives of the Clinton administration assured us that they are looking into actions that the administration can take to respond to the illegal dumping of foreign steel on the U.S. market but have yet to make a final decision on their response. 
While I appreciate their efforts to take a closer look at the problem, I am disturbed by the Administration's failure to take immediate action up to this time to prevent more cheap steel from flooding the American market. I am further disturbed by the fact that senior administration officials could not give me a specific date or timetable as to when we could expect a response from the administration on this crucial and pressing issue. 
The urgency of this crisis and the failure of the administration to take action was evident from testimony presented on September 10, 1998, where, as Chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, I joined House Chairman Regula in convening a joint meeting of the Senate and House Steel Caucuses to hear from executives from the United Steelworkers of America and a number of the nation's largest steel manufacturers about the current influx of imported steel into the United States. At that meeting, I expressed my profound concern regarding the impact on our steel companies and Steelworkers of the current financial crises in Asia and Russia, which have generated surges in U.S. imports of Asian and Russian steel. 
The past three months have been the highest monthly import volumes in U.S. history and, with Asia and Russia in economic crisis and with other major industrial nations not accepting their fair share of the adjustment burden, U.S. steel companies and employees are being damaged by this injurious unfair trade. 
The United States has become the dumping ground for foreign steel. Russia has become the world's number one steel exporting nation and China is now the world's number one steel-producing nation, while enormous subsidies to foreign steel producers have continued. In fact, the Commerce Department recently revealed that Russia, one of the world's least efficient producers, was selling steel plate in the United States at more than 50 percent, or $110 per ton, below the constructed cost to make steel plate. The dumping of this cheap steel on the American market ultimately costs our steel companies in lost sales and results in fewer jobs for American workers. 
Specifically, in the first half of 1998, total U.S. steel imports were 18.2 million net tons, which is a 12.4 percent increase over 1997's record level of 16.2 million net tons for the same period. For the month of June 1998, total U.S. imports of steel mill products totaled over 3.7 million net tons, which is up 39.2 percent from the June, 1997 level of 2.6 million net tons. In June 1998, U.S. imports of finished steel imports were a record 3 million net tons, a 41.6 percent increase over the June 1997 2.1 million net tons. 
Also in the first half of 1998, compared to the same period in 1997, steel imports from Japan are up 114 percent, steel imports from Korea are up 90 percent, and imports from Indonesia are up 309 percent. Most significantly, the U.S. steel industry currently employs 163,000 people down from 500,000 people in the 1980's. This situation is untenable for the American steelworkers, steel manufacturers, their customers, and the American people in general. 
I believe that the growing coalition of steel manufacturers, steelworkers, and Congress must work together to remedy this import crisis before it is too late and the U.S. steel industry is forced to endure an excruciatingly painful economic downturn. The United States has many of the tools at its disposal to protect our steel industry from unfair and illegally dumped steel; therefore, I submitted Senate Concurrent Resolution 121 on September 29, 1998, to call on the President to take all necessary measures to respond to the surge of steel imports resulting from the Asian and Russian financial crises. Specifically, the resolution called on the President to: pursue enhanced enforcement of the U.S. trade laws; pursue all tools available to ensure that other nations accept a more equitable sharing of these steel imports; establish a task force to closely monitor U.S. imports of steel; and, report to Congress by January 5, 1999, on a comprehensive plan to respond to this surge of steel imports. I am pleased to state that as of today's date, twenty-nine of my Senate colleagues have joined me in sponsoring this resolution. 
While this resolution is an appropriate way for Congress to express our concerns and request immediate actions by the administration to respond to the steel import crisis, I think it is also important to give the administration all the necessary tools to fight the surges of foreign steel. After reviewing the U.S. trade laws with Senator Rockefeller, we discovered that our laws regarding safeguard actions actually put the United States at a disadvantage in the international trade arena. Safeguard actions, or section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act, provide a procedure whereby the President has the discretion to grant temporary import relief to a domestic industry seriously injured by increased imports. Our laws in this area are actually more strict than those agreements made during the Uruguay Round negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). That agreement, which the Senate considered and passed on December 1, 1994, established the World Trade Organization (WTO) to administer these trade agreements. 
One such trade agreement established rules for the application of safeguard measures. The agreement provides that a member of the WTO may apply a safeguard measure to a product if the member has determined that such product is being imported into its territory in such increased quantities, absolute or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry that produces like or directly competitive products. The comparable U.S. statute, referred to as section 201, goes further than this agreement by requiring that foreign imports are the substantial cause of the injury. It just does not make sense to hinder the administration by placing this additional burden on it in evaluating a claim of injury due to surges of imports. We need to level the playing field so that all countries are playing by the same rules. This oversight is one example of the technical corrections that must be made to U.S. trade laws to bring them in line with WTO's rules. 
Specifically, the bill that Senator Rockefeller and I are introducing today, the Trade Fairness Act of 1998, makes three technical changes. First, it removes the requirement that imports must be a `substantial' cause of the serious injury by deleting the word `substantial.' The WTO's Safeguards Agreement does not require that increased imports be a `substantial' cause of serious injury. This change will lower the threshold to prove that the influx of imports were the cause of injury to the affected industry and will make U.S. law consistent with the WTO rules. 
Second, the legislation clarifies that the International Trade Commission (ITC) shall not attribute to imports injury caused by other factors in making a determination that imports are a cause of serious injury. This provision will require the ITC to evaluate causation to determine which factors are causing injury. If serious injury is being caused by increased imports, whether or not other factors are also causing injury, safeguard relief is justified. This provision is a more faithful implementation of the GATT Agreement and will prevent circumstances such as a recession from blocking invocation of Section 201 by the administration. 
Finally, this legislation brings the definition of `serious injury' in line with the definition codified in the GATT Agreement. The bill strikes the definition of serious injury and replaces it with the WTO's language regarding evaluation of whether increased imports have caused serious injury to a domestic industry. Specifically, it states `with respect to serious injury', the ITC should consider `the rate and amount of the increase in imports of the product concerned in absolute and relative terms; the share of the domestic market taken by increased imports; changes in the levels of sales; production; productivity; capacity utilization; profits and losses; and, employment.' These factors are important guidance to the ITC in evaluating a petition of serious injury. Again, I think it is appropriate to be consistent with the WTO language as America increasingly interacts on a global scale.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Valley Forge Museum of the American Revolution Act of 1998, which authorizes the Secretary of Interior to enter into an agreement with the private, non-profit Valley Forge Historical Society to construct and operate this museum and visitor center within the boundaries of Valley Forge National Historical Park. 
I have worked closely with Congressman Weldon on this legislation, and the Valley Forge Museum of the American Revolution Act included in the Omnibus National Parks and Public lands Act currently being considered in the House of Representatives. 
This museum will combine the holdings of the Valley Forge National Historical Park and the Valley Forge Historical Society, making it the largest collection of Revolutionary War era artifacts in the world. The Valley Forge Historical Society, established in 1918, has a long history of service to the park, and has amassed one of the best collections of artifacts, art, books, and documents relating to the 1777-1778 encampment of George Washington's Continental Army at Valley Forge, the American Revolution, and the American colonial era. Their collection is currently housed in a facility that is inadequate to properly maintain, preserve, and display the Society's ever-growing collection. Construction of a new facility will rectify this situation. 
This project is supported by local officials, and a new facility is part of Valley Forge National Historical Park's General Management Plan, which has identified inadequacies in the park's current visitor center and calls for the development of a new or significantly renovated museum and visitor center. The museum will educate an estimated 500,000 visitors a year about the critical events surrounding the birth of our nation. Currently, there is no museum in the United States dedicated to the American Revolution, and I believe it is important that Congress provide the authorization to bring this worthwhile project to fruition. 
This legislation authorizes the Valley Forge Historical Society to operate the museum in cooperation with the Secretary of Interior. This project will directly support the historical, educational, and interpretive activities and needs of Valley Forge National Historical Park and the Valley Forge Historical Society while combining two outstanding museum collections. 
Mr. President, this legislation holds enormous potential for visitors, scholars, and researchers to the park. I therefore urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague. 
Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak briefly in support of the International Religious Freedom Act, which was introduced today. 
Mr. President, this follows some 2 years of effort. This legislation, first introduced by Congressman Frank Wolf in the House and then introduced by myself in the U.S. Senate, seeks to put the imprimatur of the United States of America squarely in opposition to the religious persecution that is going on around the world. Again, the efforts have continued for 2 years. 
Recently, because of certain objections to the tough sanctions imposed in the bill introduced by Congressman Wolf and myself, compromise legislation has been crafted with the leadership of Senator Nickles, Senator Lieberman, Senator Coats, with my participation, which strikes out at religious persecution around the world. 
Freedom of religion is a basic American value; perhaps along with freedom of speech, the basic American value; perhaps even more important than any other value expressed in our Bill of Rights, because freedom of religion is the first item mentioned in the Bill of Rights. 
We have seen around the world egregious religious persecution with clerics being mistreated in China; with individuals being sold into slavery in Sudan. My own observations and investigation in Saudi Arabia, illustratively where Christians cannot have a Christmas tree in their window if it can be viewed by the outside; where Jewish men and women in the fighting forces in Tent City--where we have some 5,000 American personnel protecting the Saudis in the midst of a desolate desert--those Jewish military personnel are afraid to wear their dog tags, their identification being just too risky. In the Egyptian press Congressman Wolf and I have been vilified and chastised for our efforts to fight against religious persecution around the world. 
You can judge people by their enemies as well as by their friends. It is a tribute of a sort--also a tribute of a source--to be so chastised for speaking out against religious persecution. 
The bill, which was introduced today, Senate bill 1868, candidly, does not go as far as this Senator would have liked. My own view is that religious persecution ought to be met by very forceful sanctions. But the message was clear and unequivocal that the President's administration would not sign legislation with tough sanctions. 
It is regrettable that the almighty dollar continues to rule American foreign policy, and has limited the strike and has limited the resistance to religious persecution that we have articulated around the world. It would have been better for human rights to have tougher sanctions; it would have been a better statement of American values on human rights and freedom of religion and better to stamp out religious persecution to have been quite a lot tougher. 
But the reality is that we are about to the end of the 105th Congress, a week from today. Congressman Wolf and I have pressed this stronger, tougher legislation for a lengthy period of time, and if no action is taken by the end of the congressional session, then I think that is a signal for open season for those who practice religious persecution to keep it up. 
What has been crafted here is a compromise. We haven't compromised the principle, but we have adhered to the principle of compromise in crafting the legislation. It takes a very significant first step with the declaration by the U.S. Government that religious persecution is not to be tolerated. We will monitor the results, and, if necessary, we will be back with further legislation. I think this is a significant step forward. 
I compliment Congressman Wolf for his diligence over a long period of time. I compliment Senator Nickles and Senator Lieberman for their craftsmanship of working out this compromise bill, along with our distinguished colleague, Senator Coats, who commented at a press briefing a few moments ago that as a final act on a very, very distinguished career in both the House and the Senate, this bill is something to be recommended. 
I urge my colleagues to take a look at the bill, to join as cosponsors, but to certainly pass it before we end the 105th Congress so that it becomes the law of the land and it will strike a real blow for religious freedom around the world. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I was happy to read a recent article in the Washington Jewish Week, Guide to Jewish Life in Washington, 1998-1999, about Morrie Amitay and his tireless work toward improving the bonds between the United States and Israel. 
I have known Morrie since my earliest days on Capitol Hill and have had the opportunity to witness many of his accomplishments. Morrie's career is indeed impressive. During his years at Harvard Law School, Morrie developed a strong interest in United States foreign policy. This led to a career with the U.S. Foreign Service, where he served the U.S. embassies in both Italy and South Africa. Morrie's talents were quickly noted and he was promoted rapidly. In 1969, Morrie turned his attention to Capitol Hill where he took a position as a legislative assistant in the House of Representatives. 
In 1974, while working as an aide for Senator Abraham Ribicoff, Morrie was instrumental in crafting the Jackson-Vanik Amendment--part of the Trade Act of 1974--which provided for an increase of Jewish immigrants from the then-religiously oppressive Soviet Union, into the United States. 
Another significant achievement of Morrie's was to become executive director of AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. During Morrie's tenure at AIPAC, the political action committee grew to be one of the most successful interest groups in Washington, D.C. His current work involves educating the American Jewish community on defense issues, and also strengthening the strategic ties between the defense establishments of the United States and Israel. This important work is accomplished through his position as vice chairman at the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs. 
Mr. President, I am privileged to be a friend of Morrie Amitay and I am proud to stand before you today and recognize his successful career. I offer congratulations to Morrie and best wishes for the future.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation creating a Valley Forge National Cemetery and calling on the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to determine the feasibility of a national cemetery in southwestern Pennsylvania. 
This legislation specifically authorizes the Department of the Interior to transfer a portion of the Valley Forge National Historic Park to the Department of Veterans Affairs for establishment of a Valley Forge National Cemetery in Southeastern Pennsylvania. This new cemetery will be constructed and operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs' National Cemetery System (NCS). The NCS was established by Congress and approved by President Lincoln in 1862 to provide for the proper burial and registration of graves of Civil War soldiers. The NCS currently operates 115 cemeteries throughout the nation and in Puerto Rico. Since its establishment, the National Cemetery System has been fulfilling one of our nation's most solemn obligations; it has provided for the proper burial of our nation's veterans. This mission is perhaps more important today than it has been in the entire history of the NCS. The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported in a September 1997 report that the numbers of veteran deaths and interments performed by NCS continue to grow each year and are projected to peak between 2005 and 2010. This expected increase in workload has been reiterated by Mr. Roger Rapp, Acting Director of the National Cemetery System, at an April 29, 1998 hearing before the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Subcommittee on Benefits. According to Mr. Rapp, annual veteran deaths are expected to peak in 2008. 
With the fifth largest 65 and older veteran population in the country, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania faces many challenges in fulfilling the nation's solemn obligation to its deceased veterans and their families. Striving to meet these challenges, the NCS operates two Pennsylvania national cemeteries: Indiantown Gap National Cemetery and the Philadelphia National Cemetery. The Indiantown Gap National Cemetery is a 677-acre cemetery, which opened in 1982 and is expected to remain open until 2030 under estimated rates of interment. The Philadelphia National Cemetery opened in 1885 with 13 acres, reached casket capacity in 1962 and is expected to reach cremation capacity in 1999.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to offer a bipartisan Senate concurrent resolution addressing the current steel import crisis, which has been brought about due to the Asian and Russian financial crisis. 
On Thursday, September 10, 1998, as chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, I joined Congressman Regula in convening a joint meeting of the Senate and House Steel Caucus with executives from a number of the nation's largest steel manufacturers and members of the United Steelworkers of America to learn more about the current influx of imported steel into the United States. At that meeting, I expressed my profound concern regarding the impact of our steel companies and steelworkers of the current financial crisis in Asia and Russia, which have generated surges in U.S. imports of Asian and Russian steel. 
According to the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), the past three months have been the highest monthly import volumes in U.S. history and, with Asia and Russia in economic crisis and with other major industrial nations not accepting their fair share of the adjustment burden, U.S. steel companies and employees are being damaged by this injurious unfair trade. 
As Hank Barnette, Chief Executive Officer of Bethlehem Steel, wrote in an August 6, 1998 op-ed in the Washington Times, the United States has become the dumping ground for foreign steel. He noted that Russia has become the world's number one steel exporting nation and that China is now the world's number one steel-producing nation, which enormous subsidies to foreign steel producers have continued. As one example, Mr. Barnette cited the Commerce Department's recent revelation that Russia, one of the world's least efficient producers, was selling steel plate in the United States at more than 50 percent, or $110 per ton, below the constructed cost to make plate steel, which ultimately costs our steel companies in lost sales and results in fewer jobs for American workers. 
Specifically, in the first half of 1998, total U.S. steel imports were 18.2 million net tons, which is a 12.4 percent increase over 1997's record level of 16.2 million tons for the same period. For the month of June 1998, total U.S. imports of steel mill products totaled over 3.7 million net tons, which is up 39.2 percent from June, 1997 level of 2.6 million net tons. In June 1998, U.S. imports of finished steel imports were a record 3 million net tons, a 41.6 percent increase over the June 1997 2.1 million net tons. 
Also in the first half of 1998, compared to the same period in 1997, steel imports from Japan are up 114 percent, steel imports from Korea are up 90 percent, and imports from Indonesia are up 309 percent. Most significantly, the U.S. steel industry currently employs 163,000 people down from 500,000 people in the 1980's. This situation is untenable for the American steelworkers, steel manufacturers, their customers, and the American people in general. 
I believe that the growing coalition of steel manufacturers, and Congress must work together to remedy this import crisis before it is too late and the U.S. steel industry is forced to endure an excruciatingly painful economic downturn. We have many of the tools we need at our disposal to protect our steel industry from unfair and illegally dumped steel, and we must act now. At the caucus meeting, I noted my intention to once again seek enactment of my longstanding proposal to establish a private legal right of action for aggrieved steel companies and steelworkers where they can prove harm caused by illegal dumping of foreign goods. 
This resolution calls on the President to take all necessary measures to respond to the surge of steel imports resulting from the Asian and Russian financial crisis. Specifically, the attached resolution calls on the President to: pursue enhanced enforcement of the U.S. trade laws, pursue all tools available to ensure that other nations accept a more equitable sharing of these steel imports; establish a task force to closely monitor U.S.imports of steel, and, report to Congress by January 5, 1999, on a comprehensive plan to respond to this surge of steel imports.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today Mr. S.W. `Mel' Melidosian is being recognized for his distinguished service in the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office and Insurance Center in Philadelphia, the place where much of his illustrious career has taken place. After an astounding 57 years of devoted service to our nation, this remarkable man continues to serve veterans and their families. I am certain that this august body will join me in commending Mr. Melidosian on this special day. 
Mr. Melidosian's service began in the Armed Services during World War II. From 1941 to 1946, he served as a U.S. Army Ordinance Management Officer at the European Theater Headquarters and on the faculty of the Ordnance School. From 1951 to 1953, he served at the U.S. Army Logistics Command, Korea and at the U.S. Army Frankford Arsenal. 
He began serving veterans at the Veterans Administration (now the Department of Veterans Affairs) in 1946 in the Insurance Service but was recalled to active duty in Korea. In 1953, he resumed his VA job and in 1959, he was appointed Deputy Chief Insurance Director. From 1961 to 1984, he served as Director of the VA Regional Office and Insurance Center in Philadelphia, where he was instrumental in the installation of VA's first computer system for the Life Insurance Programs; consolidation of VA Regional Offices and Insurance Offices; creation of the Executive Program `Leadership VA'; and test site development of the VA Compensation & Pension on-line computer system `TARGET.' 
Mr. Melidosian has received many awards, including the Presidential Rank Award of `Distinguished Executive.' He has been continually active in the government and the community as a lecturer and chairman or member of numerous boards and commissions. 
I extend my best wishes to Mr. Melidosian for his service to our Nation's veterans and for his continued health.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to address my colleague, Chairman Stevens, concerning funding for a ship disposal initiative in the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Appropriations Act. At my request, funds were provided in the Senate bill for this program and I'm pleased to note that the conference report has preserved the Senate funding level of $7.5 million. This initiative has been crafted to address the Department of Defense Interagency Ship Scrapping Review Panel's recommendations for a pilot program. 
It was my understanding that the $7.5 million provided under Operation & Maintenance for a ship disposal initiative would be used to implement a demonstration project at the Navy's only two fresh water reserve basins, where more than 300,000 tons of ships slated for scrapping are stored, and that these funds will be distributed evenly between the two sites--the Delaware River and the James River--for the first year of this demonstration project. 
Earlier this year, I spoke with Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell and officials of the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation regarding their needs as we move ahead on revitalizing the Philadelphia Navy Shipyard. A key element of their plan is to demonstrate a ship scrapping project that assures responsible environmental health and safety management while reducing government costs for managing decommissioned ships.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment clarifies the 1920 shipping law known as the Death on the High Seas Act which has been interpreted to prohibit families of victims, such as those who were on TWA Flight 800, from seeking relief for other than pecuniary damages. 
This amendment is a modification of Senate bill 943 which I had introduced earlier with the following cosponsors Senators Santorum, D'Amato, Lautenberg, Inhofe, Gramm of Texas, Hutchison of Texas, Moynihan, Wellstone, Dodd, Feinstein, Torricelli, Murray, Durbin, Moseley-Braun, Mikulski, Sarbanes, Robb and Levin. 
We have not had an opportunity to circulate this amendment, but I do think it would have very broad support since those cosponsors supported the broader legislative proposal contained in Senate bill 943. 
Mr. President, we are submitting this compromise amendment in order to move ahead to obtain some possible compensation for damages beyond pecuniary damages. Specifically, the families of victims of plane crashes more than 3 miles off our shores will be able to sue not only for economic losses such as the lost salary of a deceased spouse, but also for non-economic losses such as loss of companionship, loss of care, and loss of comfort. 
The amendment provides that a court can make an award for nonpecuniary damages which shall not exceed the greater of the pecuniary loss sustained or a total of $750,000 per victim. 
This amendment is retroactive to the crash of TWA 800, which tragically took 230 lives on July 17, 1996. The hardest hit community in the TWA 800 crash was Montoursville, PA, which lost 16 students and 5 adult chaperones from the local high school who were participating in a long-awaited French club trip to France. It was the parents of some of these children who first contacted our office about introducing legislation to allow them to seek compensation other than for pecuniary losses, which they believed courts would not provide. 
Mr. President, under this amendment, the loss for noneconomic damages will be the greater of the pecuniary loss sustained for a total of $750,000 per victim. Illustratively, if the pecuniary loss to an individual was $1 million, then that individual could obtain $1 million for nonpecuniary damages. But if the pecuniary damages are less than $750,000, the maximum that an individual can take would be $750,000. 
I offer this amendment, Mr. President, to make the best of what I consider to be a less-than-desirable situation. I am philosophically strongly opposed to caps on damages. I believe that there is very substantial evidence that corporate America has disregarded damages to victims on a calculated pecuniary evaluation as to what will cost them the least money. 
Illustrative of that is the famous Pinto case where Ford decided to leave the gas tank in the back of the car because it would cost $11 or $12 to move it to a safe position; and there was a calculation, as disclosed in the files of the Ford Motor Company, that that judgment was made because it would be cheaper to pay the damages than it would be to change the location of the gas tank. 
I have some detailed knowledge of recent litigation involving Ford Motor Company where there was a defective brake at issue. It was acknowledged to be defective and the National Transportation Safety Board said it was defective, and there were efforts made to get Ford to recall it, but Ford did not recall it, again, obviously, because the costs they calculated would be less onerous from a financial point of view to allow that danger to remain. A young child aged 3 was killed as a result of that incident. 
And there are many, many cases--case after case--the tobacco cases, which were recently illustrative, where there is a calculation made by the corporation to give false information for pecuniary gain, which would warrant punitive damages; cases involving IUDs where there were known defective instrumentalities; cases involving flammable pajamas where children were burned; many, many cases which have led me to conclude that there really ought not to be caps. 
I have had some experience as a litigator, mostly on the defense side, some for claimants for personal injuries, but mostly on the defense side with the firm of Barnes, Dechert, Price and Rhoads, later known as Dechert, Price and Rhoads of Philadelphia, and have seen this issue from both sides of the fence. But it is not possible to move ahead on the FAA reauthorization bill, which is an appropriate spot to have this aviation amendment, without tying up this important legislation. 
We have had a series of meetings with interested parties and had an amendment to the Death on the High Seas Act been enacted which would have had unlimited damages, there was the announced intent to filibuster the bill. However, the pending FAA bill really needs to be enacted because it contains very substantial money for airport construction across my State of Pennsylvania and throughout America. 
So this is a compromise which can be worked out. The figure moved from $250,000 for nonpecuniary damages to $600,000, to the greater of the pecuniary loss or $750,000. I think that the figure is too low as it stands now, but this is the best that can be obtained today. I would note that in offering this amendment today, I make the pledge that if we fail to remove them in Conference on the FAA bill, I will introduce legislation in the next Congress to take the caps off because I think one day there will be a Congress which will be sympathetic to eliminating such caps. 
When there was a threat of a filibuster, that was on the basis that a Death on the High Seas Act amendment might be enacted without any cap at all. The whole issue of product liability is a complex issue. And there are some who think that it ought to be curtailed to some substantial extent and others who think that it ought not to be curtailed. 
But this does advance the position of families of individuals who have met with tragic death. And it is not uncommon in our Congress and our U.S. Senate that we reach compromises and live to fight another day to push the principles that we believe in. But this is the best that can be done. 
In conversations with my constituents and interested parties there is, I think, a sense that this is a desirable consequence today, the $750,000 in noneconomic damages, and that we will look to another day to try to remove the caps altogether. 
I want to comment briefly about what I consider to be a very serious potential problem for the Senate procedurally on what has occurred in this matter with respect to what amendments are in order under our rules and what notification Senators like me receive on that matter. 
It was well known by all of the interested Senators--the majority leader's office, the managers of the bill, and others--that an amendment on Death on the High Seas would be offered. 
Then there was a unanimous consent request where the matters that could be presented were limited. At that time, the technical consideration was raised as to what was a relevant amendment, which challenged the ingenuity of the Parliamentarian as to what is relevant in technical Senate rules. 
Had there been any doubt in my mind that this amendment was to be challenged on the basis of relevance, and all the interested parties knew what it was, it would be a relatively simple matter for me as a Senator having a right to object to a unanimous consent agreement and to have this specific amendment protected so that I would not face a technical challenge on relevancy. I brought that issue to the attention of the distinguished majority leader and said if we were starting to parse semicolons in this body we would have to have a lot of Senators on the floor to protect their interests on unanimous consent agreements, because it was plain that this amendment was to be offered. Our distinguished majority leader thought my point was well taken. 
Thereafter, there was another unanimous consent agreement entered into on the floor of the Senate without `hotlining'--and I don't know that anybody listening to C-SPAN2 cares about it, but the Senators do care--and hotlining is a procedure where Senators' offices are called and told this unanimous consent agreement is to be entered into, which is more than an announcement on the floor of the U.S. Senate, which may be noted or may not be noted. 
This Senator did not have notice about a limitation on the amendments which were to be limited in the FAA bill under the unanimous consent agreement. Here again, all the parties were on notice that this was an issue which this Senator intended to pursue. 
Now, I have made it plain in my discussions with the interested parties and the majority leader that I understood the importance of this FAA bill, that I would not take steps which would tie the bill up and that I was prepared to try to reach an acceptable compromise as to a figure on noneconomic damages. 
However, this experience has taught me something new. From what I have seen in the Senate up to this point, there is a recognition of what Senators intend to offer and there is notification so that Senators can appear and protect their technical interests. 
I am not claiming it is prejudice because, as I repeat, I was prepared to accept this compromise. But to be put in a position where, had I chosen not to do so, to have been foreclosed under these circumstances, I think, would have been an inappropriate limitation on my rights to offer a broader amendment. If I must take the position of filing an objection to every unanimous consent agreement, that is an alternative that I would not like. But, that may be necessary if we are not to have our interests protected and to be notified where our interests are known--to come and make sure our amendments can be offered. 
I speak about that at some great length because I am very concerned about what has happened in this case. I cannot be more emphatic in saying I disapprove of the procedures which were followed here. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington for those kind remarks. I thank him for saying the Senator from Pennsylvania has done a good job. If I can attract the attention of the Senator from Washington, I think he has done even a better job. He and I were elected in 1980 and have served in this body for some considerable period of time, and we are lawyers. It may be unwise to make that kind of admission publicly on C-SPAN2, but we are lawyers. We have many discussions and we agree most of the time. 
I heard Don Meredith, the legendary quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys, make a comment about lawyers one day. He said, `99 percent of the lawyers give the rest of them a bad name.' Senator Domenici, who is listening, is also a lawyer and, with some frequency, he disagrees with the legal profession. We will continue to take up these issues. This is the conclusion for today. 
The bill will now go to conference and, in conference, on the House side there has been a decision that the Death on the High Seas Act should not apply to any aircraft accidents. It should apply only to other instrumentalities, but not to airplanes. That will be a matter for conference. If the House should prevail, then the objectives of this Senator would have been accomplished because there would be no limitation on damages because the Act would be inapplicable to airline crashes. 
With respect to the TWA 800 incident, it ought to be noted that the federal district court, the trial court, has recently ruled that the limitation of the Death on the High Seas Act does not apply because, while it was outside of 3 miles, it was within 12 miles, and a certain action by President Reagan extended that definition of our waters to a 12-mile limit. But that hasn't been ruled upon by the court of appeals, nor by the Supreme Court. So that district court judge's ruling may change. There are issues that are yet to be resolved in conference and also in the courts on this matter. 
In conclusion, I think we have advanced the matter. It is in accordance with the traditions of the Senate to try to reach an accommodation and move the legislation forward and reenter the fray and rejoin the issue at a later date. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to express the view that Congress should make our inquiry into possible impeachment of President Clinton as bipartisan as possible, nonpartisan, fair, and judicious. There is an abundance of evidence that the American people deplore excessive partisanship in general and oppose any kind of partisanship where we are dealing with a matter which is judicial or quasi-judicial. 
I recall an admonition from my father years ago. When in a partnership situation he said, `Arlen, don't make it 50/50; give 60 percent. It will look like 50 percent to your partner. If you give 50 percent, it will look like 40 percent.' That bit of advice which my father gave me as to a partnership arrangement, I think, is applicable to relationships or arrangements of many kinds. 
I think it is very important that there be a real effort on the part of Republicans, because we Republicans are in control, to not press for every bit of advantage. I believe that the proceedings in the House were off to a good start when there was a vote of 363-33 to release the Starr report, with about two-thirds of the Democrats voting in favor of a release of the report. It seems to me where we have a proceeding like impeachment, which is really judicial, that it ought to be bipartisan or nonpartisan. 
With respect to the playing of the tapes of President Clinton, it has been my preference that the approach be somewhat different from that which was undertaken by the House of Representatives. The playing of those tapes, I think, would have been subject to no criticism at all had the House moved ahead with an impeachment inquiry, either in a preliminary stage or after the signing in a more formalistic sense to have impeachment hearings. Then it would have been in the regular course of business in regular order to see the tape of the President so that the Members of the House could make an evaluation of the evidence as to what to do next. 
Then where those hearings would be public, with the availability of the President's tape, his deposition before the grand jury would have come into the public domain in a matter of due course, and then as a regular proceeding with the hearings of the House of Representatives so that the House would have obviated the controversy and the concern of whether there was an inappropriate release of the President's tapes. Once the hearings start, even in a preliminary sense, the House Members have an obligation to see what the evidence is. 
Similarly, with the release of other evidence, such as the testimony of Ms. Monica Lewinsky yesterday, that testimony is appropriate in regular course, but there is bound to be some concern raised when it is released en masse and not as a part of a regular proceeding by the House of Representatives. 
From my days as district attorney of Philadelphia, which was a quasi-judicial position, a district attorney--a public prosecutor--is part advocate and part judge. The expression is made as to the district attorney being a quasi-judicial official. I found it very important in the cases which I tried personally and in the administration of the office to exercise great care to be fair with the defense, both in terms of proceedings generally and in the presentation of evidence at trial. 
The juries in a criminal case, like public opinion generally, have a sense as to fairness, and it builds up, I found, the credibility of the prosecutor not to be looking for every slight advantage in the course of either investigation or trial. The impeachment proceedings, it seems to me, are really totally judicial in nature. The articles of impeachment have been analogized to a bill of indictment, but I think they are not really a bill of indictment in a criminal proceeding; or it may be argued that a bill of indictment before a grand jury is judicial in nature. 
However, I hope that when we in the Congress vote in this body, when responsibilities come to the Senate, or in the other body, the House of Representatives, that there will be an approach which is bipartisan and nonpartisan. We are proceeding in a matter of the utmost, utmost gravity, the potential for impeachment of the President of the United States, and I think the American people will demand and are entitled to that kind of bipartisanship. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to honor the memory of Senator John Heinz by designating the Veterans Medical facility in Aspinwall, Pennsylvania, as the H. John Heinz III Veterans Affairs Medical Center. 
Recognition of the distinguished work of Senator Heinz has been memorialized in a variety of ways. This designation of the Veterans Center pays tribute to his outstanding work for America's veterans. Senator Heinz, a veteran himself, made many contributions to this nation and to America's veterans. 
H. John Heinz III was born on October 23, 1938 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. While he grew up in San Francisco, California, he spent many summers in Pittsburgh with his father who was chairman of the H.J. Heinz Company founded in 1869 by the Senator's great-grandfather. John graduated from Yale University with honors in 1960 and piloted a single-engine plane through Africa and the Middle East, ending up in Sydney, Australia working as a salesman for a truck company. He entered Harvard Business School in 1961 and the following year worked for the summer with the Union Bank of Switzerland in Geneva. While in Switzerland he met his future wife, Teresa Simoes Ferreira, who was attending graduate school in Geneva. He received his Master's degree in Business Administration from Harvard in 1963. 
After enlisting in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, John Heinz served on active duty in 1963 at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. For the remainder of his enlistment, he served with the 911th Troop Carrier Group based at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport. As an Airman Third Class, he received a U.S. Department of Defense citation for suggestions to improve the management of parts and supplies, saving the Air Force $400,000 annually. With the rank of staff sergeant, he received an honorable discharge from the Air Force Reserves in 1969. 
In 1964, John Heinz served as a special assistant to Senator Hugh Scott (R-PA) in Washington, D.C. and as assistant campaign manager in Senator Scott's successful reelection bid. Returning to Pittsburgh, he was employed in the financial and marketing divisions of the H.J. Heinz Company from 1965 to 1970. He married Teresa in 1966, and they subsequently had three sons: Henry John IV, Andre, and Christopher. He taught at the Graduate School of Industrial Administration at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh during the 1970-71 academic year. 
Senator Heinz was a stalwart of the Republican Party, contributing generously of his time, talents and efforts by campaigning for others. He was active in the campaigns of Governor William Scranton for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1964, Judge Maurice B. Cohill for Juvenile Court in 1965, Richard L. Thornburgh for Congress in 1966, Robert Friend for County Controller in 1967, and John Tabor for Mayor in 1969. He chaired the Pennsylvania Republican platform committee hearings in 1968, won election as a delegate at the Republican National Convention in the same year (and again in 1972, 1976, and 1980), and chaired the Pennsylvania Republican State Platform Committee in 1970. 
Upon the sudden death in April 1971 of Congressman Robert J. Corbett (R-PA), John Heinz pursued the unexpired term and won, making him the youngest Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives at 33 years old. In November 1972 and 1974, John Heinz was re-elected to the House. 
When Senator Hugh Scott announced his retirement in December 1975, Senator Heinz, George Packer and I ran for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in the April 1976 primary. After Senator Heinz won that primary contest, I endorsed him at a major rally in September 1976 in Delaware County at the kick off of his campaign in Southeastern Pennsylvania. Senator Heinz defeated Congressman William J. Green III and took his seat in the United States Senate on January 3, 1977. 
In his capacity as Chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, Senator Heinz gave me tremendous support and was instrumental in my election to the United States Senate in November 1980. 
Thereafter, Senator Heinz and I established a very close friendship and working relationship. Although I cannot personally attest to all other Senate relationships, I believe that our cooperation and coordination was as close as any two Senators from the same state in the Senate's history. 
When one of us was unable to attend a specific event, the other was always ready, willing and able to take his place. We discussed the pending international, national and state issues incessantly. On the late night sessions, and there were many, I would drive John home in my aging Jaguar leaving him off in the alley behind his home in Georgetown. 
On one occasion in 1982 we had a lengthy discussion about the upcoming vote the next day on a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. I laid out my reasons for opposing the amendment and John gave me his reasons for supporting it. I found his arguments so persuasive that I voted for the constitutional amendment for the balanced budget the next day. I was surprised to find that he voted against it. We had a good laugh on that exchange of views and our reciprocal change of positions. 
Senator Heinz and I made it a practice to inform and invite the other to all of our events. On April 3, 1991, our paths crossed in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he had scheduled a meeting with a group of doctors. I accepted his invitation and recall his warm greeting when Joan and I arrived to join the discussion. He kissed Joan on the cheek and joked with me about calling her `blondie.' We parted that day and that was the last time I saw John Heinz because he had the fatal air crash the next day, April 4, 1991, in a small plane from Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to Philadelphia. 
Senator Heinz was an extraordinary man and a great Senator. The designation of the Veterans Medical Center in Aspinwall, Pennsylvania, is an appropriate additional tribute to his memory. 
Senator Heinz' work on behalf of the citizens of Pennsylvania, young and old, will long be remembered. He was a tireless advocate for seniors, working to ensure the long-term viability of the Social Security system. He fought to protect Medicare and Medicaid patients. He authored the Age Discrimination and Employment Amendments of 1985, protecting the employment rights of our nation's seniors. He authored a bill to strengthen the U.S. job training program for displaced veterans in the work force. For military families, he worked to ensure that the children of service members were adequately cared for. He worked on behalf of U.S. workers and businesses in an increasingly international marketplace. He also played an important role in ensuring appropriate environmental protections in Pennsylvania and across the nation. John Heinz had a remarkable career of public service. 
As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I ask my colleagues to support this measure naming the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Aspinwall, Pennsylvania, after our departed colleague, Senator H. John Heinz III.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the D'Amato amendment to limit fees charged by financial institutions for the use of automatic teller machines is a very close question, in my opinion, because it pits the consumer's interest in avoiding potentially excessive bank charges against existing market forces where ATM machines provide significant convenience for the depositor's access to cash. 
On this state of the record, I do not believe that there has been a showing of excessive charges on the part of the banks. This issue might well be revisited in the Banking Committee with hearings, as opposed to being a floor amendment on this bill where the Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, did not have the benefit of an evidentiary record on the issue of excessive charges. 
On the other hand, I do believe that there is substantial benefit and convenience to the consumer who has access to a cash withdrawal, far from home, at unusual hours and under circumstances where it is a significant convenience to be able to get the cash. 
I know that when I go to a convenience store, for example, to buy milk, and pay a higher price, I dislike it; but I am mindful of the fact that it is late at night or I don't have to stand in a long line in a supermarket or it is on my way home. So, I grin and bear the somewhat higher charge. 
In addition, there may be substantial merit to the contention that if the Congress acts to affect the market on this issue that the ATM machines will not be available or may be very few in number to reduce this convenience. 
Accordingly, on this state of the record, on a very close question, I am voting against the D'Amato amendment.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to express my views on the vote we are taking today regarding the Child Custody Protection Act. I will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to consideration of this legislation because I believe it is an issue that merits consideration by the full Senate. 
Based on my conversations with Pennsylvanians throughout the Commonwealth in recent weeks, I am well aware of the strong views on either side of this issue. It is the responsibility of the Senate to deliberate over proposals concerning matters as complicated as an individual's right to an abortion, particularly when minors are involved and there are substantial State interests at stake as well. While I am troubled by some of the implications of this bill, I believe it is important that this is debated by the entire body, not just the Judiciary Committee.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on the matters now pending before the Congress as the House of Representatives considers what to do with the Starr report. I suggest that we are guided now by the genius of the Constitution, which is the most important, most efficacious, and most brilliant document ever written as to how our country should handle the issues and the problems which we now confront. 
The Constitution establishes the blueprint for what we are to do next, and that is for the House of Representatives to consider the Starr report, bearing in mind that it is a report which contains charges to which there will be a reply and, perhaps, depending upon what the House of Representatives decides, we will move to a stage of hearing evidence. 
The question of evidence is one of enormous importance because that is the determinant as to establishing the facts. In our judicial system and in our congressional system, and in the system on impeachment proceedings, the facts are established by witnesses who testify as to what they have seen or observed--or generally witnessed. It may be that we will hear people who will come forward who will tell us what they saw and what they observed as witnesses, contrasted with what appears in the news media, which is hearsay--sometimes reliable, sometimes unreliable--almost universally the source is leaks, a sustained line of source material, but one which is the common parlance. But when it comes to a proceeding as in a court proceeding or as in an impeachment proceeding, it is a matter of evidence, and the rules of evidence in an impeachment proceeding may be entirely different. There are some hearsay declarations which are admissible under complex rules. There may be broader rules of evidence established. At least we come to the point of evidence as opposed to reports and as opposed to charges. 
I think it is very important, as others have said on this Senate floor and as others have said in the public milieu, that we not rush to judgment but that we consider what the evidence is and make a considered judgment, and that the interests of fairness are paramount, as they have been reflected in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, and really improved upon in the American--the U.S. judicial system on what is due process and what is fair treatment. And deliberation is a critical part, and not rushing to judgment is a critical part. 
We will see what the House of Representatives decides to do and what the House Judiciary Committee decides to do. It may be, as the constitutional procedure specifies, that the matter will be before this body and each of us in the U.S. Senate will be, in effect, a juror. It is a complex matter which portends great problems for our Government if the House takes up the matter of impeachment proceedings. It will tie up the House. If the Senate deliberates as a jury, it will obviously tie up this body. And what is not generally recognized is that the Constitution requires the Chief Justice to preside, so it ties up the Supreme Court of the United States. But the Constitution, that brilliant document, sets forth the ground rules, and we have that as, really, the strength of our American institutions to guide us in these very, very troubled times. 
I think it is very important that the Senate, and the House, too, focus on very important legislative matters which have come before us in the course of the balance of September. Those are the appropriations bills which fund the Federal $1.7 trillion budget. I have the privilege to serve as chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee which has jurisdiction over the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Labor. Traditionally, this bill has been left to the end because it is so contentious. Senator Harkin, the ranking Democrat, and I have conferred and have formulated a plan to try to bring our bill to fruition early on this year. If we wish to get something done--something I learned a long time ago in the Senate is that if you want to accomplish what is in the public interest, we have to cross party lines to do it. Senator Harkin and I have worked on that line. 
Our staffs did an excellent job in pushing ahead on an expedited basis to prepare a subcommittee report during the month of August, and on the second day that we were back, September 1, a week ago Tuesday, the subcommittee acted, and then, under Senator Stevens' leadership, the full committee acted on Thursday. So the bill, appropriations for Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, is now ready to come to the floor. The distinguished majority leader has stated that our bill can be considered immediately after the Interior bill, so that we do not wait until the very end of September. But Senator Lott has articulated a fair admonition, that if the bill becomes cluttered with so-called killer amendments or becomes highly politicized, that we cannot keep the bill on the Senate floor but it will be taken down. I think that is a fair consideration. So we have our own institutional prerogatives. It goes without saying sometimes politics dominates what happens on the Senate floor, but it is our hope that we will be able to avoid killer amendments and will be able to proceed to consider the merits of the bill. 
Senator Harkin and I have discussed this with the distinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, who is sympathetic to our point of view and, without making commitments, has stated he would like to see that proceed. We discussed the issue of time limits, and I have already started to talk to Senators who have amendments where we can consider a time agreement, an hour equally divided or perhaps an hour and a half equally divided, so that we take up issues which have to be debated and have a resolution of them, hopefully omitting the highly politicized matters where there is going to be deadlock and which might require that the bill be taken down. 
Our subcommittee has had a good working relationship with the House. We worked through with Congressman Porter, the subcommittee chairman on the House side, my counterpart, and with Congressman Livingston, the chairman of the full committee. It is our realistic hope, realistic expectation, that we can work through the process there. 
I had a chance to discuss the matter previously with the President--yesterday. It was an event in the White House, where Pennsylvania was a recipient. As is the custom, I received an invitation to attend, and did so, and had a chance to talk for a few moments with the President about this bill, Labor-HHS-Education. The President stated that he thought our Senate bill was a significant improvement over what has come out from the House Appropriations Committee. I pointed out that, while it did not have everything the President had asked for, it was important to focus on the fact that the bill was $1.9 billion short of what the President had projected on income because we do not have the receipts from the tobacco bill, which was never acted upon, and we did not have the user fees, which had not been authorized. 
Senator Harkin and I, then, earlier this week, took a rather unusual step of convening a meeting of governmental affairs people, also known as lobbyists, who have an interest in this bill, especially those who have increases, as we have significant increases on the National Institutes of Health, Head Start, and the National Labor Relations Board, in order to secure their assistance. Because, if we go to a continuing resolution, then those matters will be funded at last year's level and they will not have the advantages of the additions. So there is some very keen potential interest on their part seeing this bill move. Our request to them was to exercise their best efforts--they have a lot of contacts in the Senate, the House and the White House--to help us move the bill. 
So I speak about this subject at some length, although I think not at excessive length here today, to urge my colleagues to focus on the appropriations process and not to be distracted by what is happening with the Starr report and the collateral problems which our country faces at this moment. 
One of our colleagues said last week that when the Starr report hit, those issues were au courant in Washington, that it would suck all the oxygen out of every room in Washington, DC, which is a dramatic characterization, but one which I think is realistic; sucking all the oxygen out of every room in Washington, so that that is the sole focus of attention. From the conversations in the Cloakroom and on the floor, that is a realistic problem. 
I do believe we have to maintain a focus on these appropriations bills which are so important, as we look to what is going to happen with the National Institutes of Health in cancer research, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, et cetera, what happens with education on increases for Head Start, guaranteed student loans, what happens on worker safety. We are going to push very hard to bring forward our bill, hopefully next week, and debate the issues under time agreements to let this body work its will and try to work the matter through the House and then through the White House and then take up the other appropriations bills, so that while we have this grave national problem which we have to consider at the same time, we do not lose focus that September is the critical month for appropriations bills. 
I ask all of my colleagues who anticipate amendments for this bill to let us know at an early date so that we can make a decision on what might be accepted, what might be compromised, or what might be subjected to time limits so that notwithstanding the problems which the President faces and which, in turn, the country faces, that we can focus on the appropriations process and complete the people's business during the month of September. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.  
Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, although it is late in the session, I am introducing legislation to rectify a problem facing one of my constituents, Mr. Paul Finnerty of Scranton, and his wife concerning his federal retirement benefits. It is necessary for Congress to become involved in this case because Mr. Finnerty has exhausted administrative relief and lost an estoppel claim in the 3rd Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, which ruled that `regardless of the possibility of agency error in this case, we have no authority over the disbursement of funds that has been assigned by the Constitution to Congress alone.' 
I am advised that Mr. Finnerty and his wife are entitled to employee and spousal annuities based on his more than 30 years in the railroad industry. They were misinformed by federal employees as to the actual retirement benefits they would receive and relied to their detriment on the higher figure in deciding that Mr. Finnerty should retire in 1993. Specifically, there is documentation which reflects the failure of the Scranton Field Office of the Railroad Retirement Board to advise Mr. Finnerty appropriately regarding the impact of a statutory maximum of $1200/month in retirement benefits if he remained in the federal CSRS pension system instead of switching into the FERS system. I have enclosed an example of such documentation for the Record. 
While the private relief legislation is a last resort used sparingly by the Congress, the Finnertys have provided enough documentation to suggest that their request merits careful review by the Labor Committee, which has jurisdiction over such bills. Accordingly, I am introducing this bill today to begin that review process.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to submit a Resolution that seeks the President's assistance in recovering three Americans--Mark Rich, David Mankins, and Rick Tenenoff--who were abducted by the Colombian terrorists known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) on January 31, 1993, from the Kuna Indian village of Pucuro in the Darien Province of Panama. 
I first became aware of this situation at a Lancaster County open house town meeting at the Lancaster City Council Chambers on February 9, 1998. At the meeting, Ms. Peggie Miller urged me to get involved in the situation. Also present at the meeting were Chester and Mary Bitterman. Mr. Bitterman stood and spoke passionately about his son, Chet Bitterman, III, who was a missionary translator with Wycliffe Bible. Chet Bitterman, III, was kidnapped in Bogota, Colombia, in January, 1981, held hostage for 48 days and then found brutally murdered by Colombian terrorists on march 7, 1981. Not only did Mr. and Mrs. Bitterman lose a son, but Chet left a wife and two very young daughters. A book entitled `Called to Die' written by Steve Estes describes the horrible situation. Upon the urging of these constituents, I met with New Tribes Mission, the State Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency to see what we could do about recovering these kidnapped men. 
This resolution expresses the sense of the Congress that the President and his representatives should raise the issue of the kidnapping of Mark Rich, David Mankins, and Rick Tenenoff of the New Tribes Mission and other American victims in Colombia to all relevant foreign governments, non-governmental organizations, and religious institutions at every opportunity until a favorable outcome is achieved. The international community should encourage groups believed to have information on this case to come forward. The legislation urges that all the appropriate information obtained should be turned over in a timely basis to the New Tribes Mission crisis response team. 
Most importantly, the resolution proposes that the President of the United States and the Secretary of State offer reward money for information leading to the release of Mark, David and Rick. President Clinton should also encourage the cooperation of newly-elected Colombian President Pastrana to assist in the publication of the reward information. Without cooperation between our two governments, we may never see the return of these men to their families in the United States. 
There are indications that Mr. Rich, Mr. Mankins, and Mr. Tenenoff have been held in Colombia for over five years; therefore, they would be the longest held American hostages in Colombia. The United States government should do all it can to protect its citizens against terrorist acts; I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in supporting adoption of this resolution.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on the statements made earlier today by Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy relating to an independent counsel because there is a specific course of action which can be taken to break the impasse, in my legal judgment, and that is with an action for mandamus in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to compel Attorney General Reno to appoint an independent counsel. 
There is no doubt about the serious allegations and scandals in campaign financing. The Governmental Affairs Committee on which I serve conducted extensive hearings last year which showed beyond any doubt irregularities of a most important sort, and some even involving contributions coming from foreign sources traceable to the Government of China. In the face of this overwhelming evidence, the Attorney General has declined to appoint an independent counsel. 
The remedy is present for a mandamus action, which would be directed on two legal lines. One is where Attorney General Reno has failed to carry out a mandatory duty, where the independent counsel statute says that she shall act on covered persons, and an alternative legal approach where there is an abuse of a discretionary duty where there is a conflict of interest, and there is both an actual and an apparent conflict of interest. Importantly, Attorney General Reno, when questioned during her confirmation hearing, was a great advocate of an independent counsel on precisely the kind of circumstances which are presented here. 
The mandamus action was pursued on three individual occasions, and the United States District Court for the District of Columbia did order mandamus. All three of those cases were reversed for reasons which are not applicable here, where there was lack of standing which was delineated in extensive discussions in the court of appeals on two of those cases. But those three cases by district court judges did confirm the legal approach which I am advocating here today, and which is encompassed in an extensive lawsuit, which has been prepared against Attorney General Reno, calling for a mandamus action. 
In two of the cases they were reversed because of lack of standing, and that is a legal issue which poses a hurdle which I believe can be overcome by action by a majority of the majority of the Judiciary Committee of either the House of Representatives or the U.S. Senate. The independent counsel statute gives a majority of the majority of each Judiciary Committee unique positioning to have the requisite standing to require an answer by the Attorney General on a statement of facts and a request that independent counsel be appointed. That does not mean conclusively that there would be standing for a mandamus action, but it is a very strong argument in support of that standing. And, in two of the cases where the court of appeals reversed an order for independent counsel to be appointed, the special standing of Congress and the special standing of the Judiciary Committee was noted. In one of the cases, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia referred to congressional oversight, which this would be, and in another case the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia referred to the special positioning, which the Judiciary Committee had. 
There is another issue, laying all the cards on the table face up, as to separation of powers, on matters which were raised in the decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Morrison v. Olson, upholding the constitutionality of the independent counsel statute. Some of the language of the Supreme Court there has been cited, from time to time, as raising a hurdle for this kind of a lawsuit. But I would point out that, on two of the issues which were raised by the Supreme Court of the United States, the legal argument runs in favor of this kind of an action. 
The Supreme Court there referred to a provision of the statute which said that there could be `no judicial review of an action by the Attorney General appointing independent counsel.' But the negative implication there is that review would be possible where the Attorney General declines to appoint an independent counsel. There is also a provision in the statute which says that there may be no judicial review by the special three-judge panel where the Attorney General decides not to appoint an independent counsel, and again, by negative implication, there can be review by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The three-judge panel is a special panel created to make the actual appointment of an independent counsel. 
Mr. President, in outlining these legal hurdles, there is no doubt that there are problems here. But, in my legal judgment, each of these hurdles and any other can be surmounted. And certainly, where there is such a pressing reason to move because of what has happened here on a compelling factual basis, I strongly believe that this effort ought to be made and that it can be made by a majority of the majority on the Judiciary Committee of the Senate or a majority of the majority in the House. And perhaps it would be appropriate for both the House and the Senate to join together as parties plaintiff to solidify and enforce the standing issue and the importance of this action. 
My views are not those which I express lightly. They did not arise in the course of the last few days or the last few weeks. My initial concerns were expressed in a Judiciary oversight hearing back on April 30 of 1997, when Attorney General Reno appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee and was questioned extensively by a number of Members, including myself. At that time I pressed Attorney General Reno on some of the so-called issue advertisements which were really, by any legal interpretation, express advocacy. 
Now, if they are express advocacy, and if there is coordination with the Republican National Committee or the Democratic National Committee, then they violate the law; they violate the Federal election law. And, in articulating this concern, on a number of occasions I have said that there is fault on both sides, both by the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee. But the activities by the Democratic National Committee stand on a different level because of the active participation by President Clinton himself in micromanaging the campaign and in working on these commercials. We know that from the testimony, statements of Mr. Leon Panetta, Chief of Staff of President Clinton, and from the statements of Mr. Dick Morris, who was the President's principal adviser on these campaign matters. 
This is illustrative of what these commercials had to say. This appeared on advertising: 
Head Start, student loans, toxic cleanup, extra police, anti-drug programs--Dole-Gingrich wanted them cut. Now, they're safe, protected in the 1996 budget because the president stood firm. Dole-Gingrich--deadlock, gridlock, shutdowns. The president's plan--finish the job, balance the budget, reform welfare, cut taxes, protect Medicare. President Clinton gets it done. Meet our challenge, protect our values. 
Under no stretch of the imagination could that kind of advertisement be classified as articulating an issue only contrasted with articulating advocacy for the President's campaign. 
I asked Attorney General Reno about that specifically on April 30 of 1997. Her response to me was that based on a memorandum of understanding with the Federal Election Commission, it was up to the Federal Election Commission. 
On the next day, May 1, 1997, I wrote to Attorney General Reno with a long list of specific advertisements which were conclusively advocacy ads which, when designated and designed and worked on by the President himself, would constitute a violation of the law. 
On June 17, I received a reply from Attorney General Reno and then from the Federal Election Commission saying that the Attorney General was saying it was up to the Federal Election Commission and the Federal Election Commission said that they would give advisory opinions. That is something for the future but not something that had already been done.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I returned to this issue with Attorney General Reno when she came in for an oversight hearing on July 15 of this year and confronted Attorney General Reno with the very basic fact that the Federal election law, with criminal provisions, is the responsibility of the Department of Justice to enforce and the responsibility of the chief enforcement officer, the Attorney General, to enforce, so that by no stretch of the imagination would it be plausible for the Attorney General to say that it was a matter for the Federal Election Commission. Notwithstanding that, the Attorney General continued to articulate this argument that it was a matter for the Federal Election Commission, which I submit, and I say this respectfully, is spurious and facetious on its face. How can it be a matter for the Federal Election Commission when it is a criminal law, criminal sanction which is the responsibility of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice? This was a very, very material matter. 
Mr. President, I think it is relevant at this point to display a couple of charts, one of which is on the issue of covered persons. Referring to the coordination of advocacy advertisements, President Clinton made a statement on December 7 of 1995 at a Democratic National Committee lunch, which is really more than a smoking gun, it is a firing gun, that is on these advertisements. This is the President's voice on tape: 
Now we have come way back. . . . But one of the reasons has been. . .we have been running these ads, about a million dollars a week. . . . So I cannot overstate to you the impact that these paid ads have had in the areas where they've run. Now we're doing better in the whole country. . . . [I]n areas where we've shown these ads we are basically doing ten to fifteen points better than in areas where we are not showing them. . . . 
The chart shows Leon Panetta confirmed that President Clinton helped direct expenditures of $35 million in DNC ads, and Dick Morris confirmed that President Clinton micromanaged the TV ad campaign. 
This chart was presented during the Judiciary Committee hearing. In addition, the instance of the covered persons where a Mr. Warren Meddoff on October 22, 1996, personally handed President Clinton a business card with a written message suggesting a $5 million contribution. 
Two days later on October 24 and again on October 26, deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes solicited Mr. Meddoff, including a call from Air Force One. 
On October 29 and 30, Mr. Ickes called Mr. Meddoff and asked for an immediate contribution of $1.5 million within 24 hours. 
There are two other instances depicted on this chart, and this chart only covers a very limited amount of information which was disclosed in the hearings of the Governmental Affairs Committee. One of them was a coffee which was held in the Oval Office. The President had received a memorandum from the Democratic National Committee which bore the President's writing, so we know that it was actually seen by the President. 
This memorandum identified five individuals who, according to the memo, would be good for a contribution of $100,000 each. They were accorded a coffee in the White House. On May 1, there was this coffee in the Oval Office. Within the course of the week, four of the individuals contributed $100,000 each. That is not in the living quarters. That is not in any way, shape or form justifiable. 
When I asked Attorney General Reno about this specifically--and bear in mind that at Judiciary Committee hearings, we have a very limited amount of time. It is not like a speech on the Senate floor where there is unlimited debate. Attorney General Reno said to me, when I asked her if this did not constitute where four people came in--bear with me. Let me read the specific information as to the question I put to the Attorney General, whether this wasn't specific and credible evidence which would satisfy the test of the independent counsel statute. 
At page 193 of the record: 
Attorney General Reno: I will be happy to review it with the task force and get back to you, Senator. 
Senator Specter. Well, OK. I would ask you to review the balance of it. We will provide you with more of the specific and credible evidence, but don't you have a judgment today, Madam Attorney General? 
Attorney General Reno: I will review it with the task force. 
The other specific bit of evidence was a June 18, 1996, coffee. In the presence of President Clinton, John Huang solicited the attendees saying: 
Elections cost money, lots and lots of money, and I am sure that every person in this room will want to support the re-election of President Clinton. 
This language is important because it was stated in the presence of the President in the White House. We know that from the testimony of a former official in the National Security Council who was sitting on one side of the President, a greater distance from the individual who made the statement and the comment was heard. 
Again, when confronted with this specifically, the Attorney General declined to give an opinion but said she would get back to me. 
That was on July 15 of this year. And more than 45 days have passed, and we still do not have the information. 
Very briefly--I will not belabor the point--this was another chart presented at Judiciary Committee hearings which shows the alternative approach on the legal issue, and that is, conflict of interest, where you have Johnny Chung, who contributed some $366,000 to the Democratic National Committee, you have the connection with the President, Vice President, and Mr. Glicken. You have a connection with President Clinton and Pauline Kanchanalak, the connection between President Clinton and John Huang, the connection between Vice President Gore and Maria Hsia, the connection between President Clinton and Charlie Trie. 
In all of these matters there is a conflict of interest where these individuals have been indicted. All except for Mr. Huang, there is the delicate matter of plea bargaining and a matter where there ought to be independent counsel not being directed by the Attorney General, who is the appointee of the President. 
As outlined in some detail earlier by Senator Hatch--and I will not go over that ground--this evidence has been so compelling that FBI Director Louis Freeh has taken the public position that independent counsel ought to be appointed, not an easy thing to do for the FBI Director, who is a subordinate of the Attorney General. But the FBI Director made that statement. 
Then you have the legal judgment of Mr. Charles LaBella, who is the chief prosecutor, also to the effect that independent counsel ought to be appointed. Then when Mr. LaBella was expected to be appointed as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California, he was skipped over--a question which needs to be answered in terms of whether his candid approach, disagreeing with the Attorney General of the United States, was a causal factor in his being passed over. 
Mr. President, what I have outlined here is a very, very brief statement of very, very compelling evidence of irregularities in campaign finance. And when you deal with the issue of how Federal elections for the Presidency, for the Senate, and the House of Representatives are financed, that goes right to the core of our democratic institutions. 
There is an enormous amount of skepticism in America today with the way we have political activities. I just finished, during the course of August, some 12 to 15 town meetings. In every meeting I was asked about campaign finance reform. And there was obvious cynicism by my constituents and really disgust with the way the system is run. And I was asked whether there would be campaign finance reform. 
On a number of occasions it was noted that the House of Representatives had taken the bull by the horns and had passed campaign finance reform. And when asked whether it would be done in the Senate, I candidly said it was highly doubtful that 8 additional Senators could be found to join the 52 of us who have voted for cloture in order to have campaign finance reform. 
If independent counsel were appointed and we got to the bottom of these issues--and many, many more--I think there would be a tidal wave of public insistence on campaign finance reform which is very necessary for the integrity of the electoral process. 
When Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, speaks at great length about his frustration in what the Attorney General has not done, that is a frustration I think shared by most of Americans. Certainly it is a frustration which I share, and I think is shared by most of the members of the Judiciary Committee and most of the Members of the Congress of the United States. 
In preparing this complaint in mandamus, we have a course of action which has a realistic chance of success. Is it a guarantee? No. There are many lawsuits which are filed, litigation, matters which are initiated which are not absolute guarantees. But when you have very, very compelling factual circumstances, as you do here, it is my legal judgment that the hurdles which have to be overcome can be overcome. And certainly it is an alternative which ought to be tried. It is my hope that the Attorney General will respond and appoint independent counsel. When she has, again, taken steps to have an additional investigation for 90 days, it is not totally insufficient, but it is a sharp indication that she has no intention to go to the core problems, some of which I have outlined here today. 
When she activates a 90-day period of an investigation of Vice President Gore on the telephone calls, that is really a red herring, an effort to show some action which is totally--totally--insufficient. When she activates, as she did the day before yesterday, a 90-day period on Deputy Chief of Staff Ickes on a very limited phase, that again is totally insufficient. 
What is necessary is to pick up the broad range of investigative leads identified by to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis Freeh, and the broad range of leads identified by the chief counsel on the matter, Charles LaBella, to proceed. And if the Attorney General does not proceed, then it is my strong recommendation that the Judiciary Committee, a majority of the majority, take the bull by the horns and move to take action to compel the appointment of independent counsel through a mandamus act. 
The draft copy of the complaint of mandamus--may I add that this is not carved in stone, that we are actively working to update it and to improve the complaint of mandamus, will outline the legal bases and is an outline of the evidentiary base for such an action.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this funding is very important so that the processing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty may go forward. This treaty is an important component of nuclear arms control and nonproliferation policy. 
On behalf of the United States, President Clinton signed the treaty on September 24, 1996, the day it was open for signature, and thereafter transmitted it to the Senate on September 22, 1997, for advice and consent or ratification. 
The treaty has been signed by 149 nations, ratified by 15. The treaty will enter into force after 44 states specified in the treaty have ratified it. The initial signatories to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty established a preparatory commission to carry out the necessary preparations for implementation of the treaty as its entry into force. The preparatory commission will ensure that a verification regime is established that can meet the treaty's requirements. 
The need for this treaty came into very, very sharp focus earlier this year when on May 12 of 1998 we had the detonation of nuclear devices--actually it was on May 11--by India and two more on May 13. Then Pakistan responded with five tests on May 28 and one on May 30. The issues posed by India and Pakistan engaging in nuclear tests is one of overwhelming importance to the feuding which has been going on between those two countries for years and the possibility of nuclear war being initiated as a result of those two nations now having publicly announced their nuclear powers, having tested nuclear devices. 
I saw firsthand the issues relating to these two countries when Senator Hank Brown and I visited both India and Pakistan back in August of 1995. On August 28, 1995, Senator Brown and I sent the following letter to President Clinton: 
Dear Mr. President: I think it important to call to your personal attention the substance of meetings which Senator Hank Brown and I have had in the last two days with Indian Prime Minister Rao and Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. 
Prime Minister Rao stated that he would be very interested in negotiations which would lead to the elimination of any nuclear weapons on his subcontinent within ten or fifteen years including renouncing first use of such weapons. His interest in such negotiations with Pakistan would cover bilateral talks or a regional conference which would include the United States, China and Russia in addition to India and Pakistan. 
When we mentioned this conversation to Prime Minister Bhutto this morning-- 
That is on August 28-- She expressed great interest in such negotiations. When we told her of our conversation with Prime Minister Rao, she asked if we could get him to put that in writing. 
When we asked Prime Minister Bhutto when she had last talked to Prime Minister Rao, she said that she had no conversations with him during her tenure as Prime Minister. Prime Minister Bhutto did say that she had initiated a contact through an intermediary but that was terminated when a new controversy arose between Pakistan and India. 
From our conversations with Prime Minister Rao and Prime Minister Bhutto, it is my sense that both would be very receptive to discussions initiated and brokered by the United States as to nuclear weapons and also delivery missile systems. 
I am dictating this letter to you by telephone from Damascus so that you will have it at the earliest moment. I am also telefaxing a copy of this letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
After sending that letter to President Clinton, I have had an opportunity to discuss the issue with President Clinton on a number of occasions, and the President has stated an interest in trying to work with both India and Pakistan. Of course, the President has communicated with both India and Pakistan, at least following their nuclear detonations. But that is a matter which I think might profitably involve substantial activity by the United States. 
But the succession of events have followed so that in May of this year, the time had arisen for India to make a public disclosure, a public test, and then it was followed immediately by Pakistan. It is a matter where those in India might well question the intensity of interest of the United States in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty when the United States is not a party to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on May 14, 1998, I wrote to Senator Helms as follows: 
I write to urge you to act as promptly as possible to conduct a hearing or hearings and to bring the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate floor for a ratification vote. In my judgment, the events of the past several days make that the Senate's number one priority. 
Following India's nuclear tests, Pakistan is now preparing for similar tests. North Korea has stated its intention to move forward to develop nuclear weapons and Iran and Iraq are lurking in the background. 
At a hearing before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee yesterday, Secretary of Defense Cohen urged Senate consideration and ratification of the treaty. 
As you know, the President submitted the treaty to the Senate on September 22, 1997, and the only hearings which have been held were conducted by the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services on October 27, 1997, and March 18, 1998, and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development on October 28, 1997. 
I noted the comment in your letter to the President on January 21, 1998, that this treaty is very low on the Committee's list of priorities, and I also heard your staffer on National Public Radio this week state that the Foreign Relations Committee did not intend to move ahead on the treaty. 
I am concerned that inaction by the Senate may have led the government of India to think that the United States is indifferent to nuclear testing which, I believe, is definitely not the case. The events of the past several days threaten an international chain reaction on the proliferation of nuclear weapons and an imminent threat to world peace. 
From comments on the Senate floor and in the cloakroom, I know that many, if not most, of our colleagues share my concern about action on the treaty. 
I realize that there is some opposition to the treaty; if it is the will of the Senate not to ratify, so be it; but at the very least, the matter should be submitted to the full Senate. 
Sincerely, Arlen Specter.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Helms has not responded to that letter. I think it appropriate to note Senator Helms has been absent for some time because of important medical reasons--a knee replacement, I believe. 
On May 19, Senator Biden and I circulated a `Dear Colleague' letter requesting cosponsors for a resolution urging hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and debate on the Senate floor. There are at this moment 36 cosponsors. 
On July 21 of this year, I offered an amendment to the fiscal year foreign operations bill to remove the prohibition on funding for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Preparatory Commission. That amendment was accepted. Mr. President, I believe that the inclusion of these funds is very, very important so that the Preparatory Commission can move forward. But I believe that this amendment has further significance as a test vote, so to speak, as to the views of the Senate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
I have discussed with my distinguished colleague, Senator McConnell, the chairman of the subcommittee, my interest in having a vote on this matter. I do so not only to strengthen the position in conference--as a practical matter, if a matter is accepted on a voice vote, there is not quite the punch as if there is a very substantial vote in favor of the amendment. And I do recognize that calling for a vote on the amendment--that any vote on the Senate floor is risky business to an extent, but I believe that a vote will have significance beyond the specific dollars and cents which are involved here. 
It is my sense that arms control is a very, very important international issue at the present time, if not the most important issue. As we speak, President Clinton is meeting with Russian President Yeltsin in a very unstable situation in Russia. There are concerns as to what the future of the Government headed by President Yeltsin will be. There are concerns that the Communist Party may gain power in Russia. There are obvious concerns about what may happen to the Russian Government in the future and whether militaristic forces or reactionary forces might take control there, which could plunge the world into another arms race. So this issue with Russia is a very, very important one as we take a look at arms control. 
We have the issues with China, an emerging power, and the need to limit, to the extent we can, activity by China on nuclear testing. We have the situation in North Korea where the reports are that they are moving back for their nuclear weapons. We have Iran and Iraq, emerging powers, with nuclear weapons. We have missiles being sold to Pakistan. There is a very dangerous, very unsafe world out there, to put it mildly. 
I think it is an unfortunate situation that we have the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty not moving forward in the Senate. Under the Constitution, Senate ratification is necessary if a treaty is to take effect. It would be my hope that the Foreign Relations Committee would hold hearings on the matter or make its own judgment, or bring the matter to the Senate floor, and let the full Senate work its will. 
In the absence of activity there, this amendment--to repeat--has the effect of being a test vote, so to speak, although you can support the Preparatory Commission without necessarily being for the treaty, because we have to take these steps in any event. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Biden be listed as my principal cosponsor on the pending amendment.

Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I outlined the purpose of this amendment earlier today. What it does is provide for some $28.9 million of funding for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Preparatory Commission. There is not a problem with the funding coming out of unobligated funds of prior years. 
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is pending before the U.S. Senate. Senator Biden and I had submitted a resolution sponsored by some 36 Senators which called for hearings before the Foreign Relations Committee and a vote by the Senate on ratification of the constitutional procedure. 
The matter now pending is somewhat different, and that is to provide funding for the Preparatory Commission. The problem with testing, which is going on now, has become very acute during the course of the past several months--when India initiated nuclear testing, followed by Pakistan--those two countries with all of their controversy are on the verge of real problems. 
I said earlier this morning that when Senator Brown and I traveled to India back in August of 1995 and talked to Prime Minister Rao, he was interested in having the subcontinent nuclear-free. Shortly thereafter, we visited Pakistan and saw their political leader, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who had a similar view, but that situation has deteriorated materially. 
In asking for a vote on this matter, it is not only to strengthen the position in conference where we know that on a voice vote, sometimes the position in conference is not as strong. But, also in the absence of the Senate taking up the Treaty, to have a show of support for the Treaty as I think will be reflected at least in part; although, you could support this amendment without necessarily committing to the Treaty. 
Mr. President, at this time I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.

Mr. SPECTER. My question, I say to Senator Nickles, relates to the consequences of a resignation. I commend you for the statement which you have just made. I have joined others in the call for an independent counsel. And, in fact, when questioning Attorney General Reno on July 15 of this year--2 weeks ago on Wednesday--I asked her about specific cases and had an extensive chart which showed the justification for an independent counsel. 
Then, because of the limitation of time, I mentioned only two cases, one where a memorandum had come from the Democratic National Committee to the White House identifying five people who were identified as being good for $100,000 each. The President initialed it. The Democratic National Committee called for a coffee. It was held in the Oval Office. Within a few days thereafter, four of the five contributed $100,000--specific and credible evidence. And the Attorney General responded she would get back to me, which I said surprised me because it was a well-known matter. 
The second matter that I called to her attention--of only two because of the limitation of time--involved John Huang, where the photograph appeared and Carl Jackson, formerly of the NSC, National Security Staff, commented that Huang, in the presence of the President in the White House had said `Elections are expensive, and we expect people to contribute.' I have pressed for a mandamus act which I will not discuss now. I have on prior occasions. 
The question that I have for my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma--and I thank my colleague from West Virginia--is, What will be accomplished with a resignation? Is there any expectation that the President will appoint somebody who will be tougher on the campaign irregularities in which he is so deeply involved, at least by allegation? Wouldn't the better course be to move on the legal front, recognizing that it is a very tough case, candidly, an uphill fight--a long shot, in common parlance--contrasted with the resignation where we are going to have a lengthy delay before a nomination is made--confirmation hearings--familiarity would be a matter of months--before a substitute attorney general would be in a position to respond to this issue about appointment of an independent counsel?

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to recognize the 15-year anniversary of a unique partnership between labor and management in the glass container manufacturing industry. This highly successful program in the glass container industry is called the `Industry Union Glass Container Promotion Program' or Nickel Solution. This effort is a fine example of workers and employers joining together during a time of change and transition in America's oldest industry. Since the 1700s, the men and women who make glass containers have demonstrated a steadfast commitment to produce the best in glass packaging. The Nickel Solution is one shining example of that dedication. 
The State of Pennsylvania is home to six glass container manufacturing plants--more than any other state except California. These facilities mean good paying jobs for approximately 3,000 Pennsylvanians and are major employers in Brockway, Clarion, Connellsville, Crenshaw, Glenshaw and Port Allegany, Pennsylvania. 
The Nickel Solution was based originally on voluntary contributions of a nickel per hour of pay from glass container industry employees to support a national fund to promote glass packaging and safeguard jobs. In turn, employers matched the contributions, setting the stage for joint cooperation and promotion. 
Through glass plant public relations committees, staffed by employee volunteers, the glass container industry's interests are well monitored and protected. Employees educate communities about glass recycling, conduct `buy in glass' promotions, and act as the front line for local, regional, and state advocacy. The Nickel Solution has enabled both labor and management to accomplish their goals of relative stability and secure employment for thousands of people in some 60 plants in 24 states throughout the country. 
The Nickel Solution is simple and works, proving its value time and again. The Nickel Solution has enabled the glass container industry to march forward to a brighter future.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to recognize the Air Force Office of Special Investigations on its 50th anniversary, August 1, 1998. 
The Office of Special Investigation was created in 1948 at the suggestion of the 80th Congress. Then Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington consolidated and centralized the investigative services of the United States Air Force to create an organization that would conduct independent and objective criminal investigations. Since 1948, the Office of Special Investigations has evolved into an organization that not only conducts criminal and fraud investigations, but investigates and thwarts terrorism and espionage, pursues military fugitives, and maintains the security of the Air Force's computer systems. The Office of Special Investigations has truly adapted to fulfill the needs of the United States Air Force in the 21st Century. 
At present, 2,000 men and women serve in the Office of Special Investigations. In more than 150 offices across the United States and in a dozen offices overseas, these men and women perform the investigative work of the United States Air Force wherever and whenever they are needed. I am proud to be among the 11,000 alumni of the Office of Special Investigations. I served as a lieutenant in the OSI from 1951 through 1953 and was assigned to the Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware District. My experience allowed me to serve my country, hone my investigative skills, and better prepare me for a career in the law and in government. 
It gives me great pleasure, Mr. President, to stand before you and salute the Office of Special Investigations on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. Its legacy of service, integrity, and excellence continues today. A better motto could not have been chosen to commemorate OSI's 50th anniversary: `Preserving Our Legacy, Protecting our Future.'

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce legislation to authorize the addition of the Paoli Battlefield site in Malvern, Pennsylvania to Valley Forge National Historical Park. The Paoli Massacre was an important chapter in the British campaign to capture Philadelphia in 1777. More than 50 American soldiers lost their lives when the British attacked and bayoneted General `Mad' Anthony Wayne's forces at Paoli Battlefield. Accordingly, this land needs to be preserved as an important part of Pennsylvania's history and our nation's history. 
Congressman Curt Weldon has introduced this legislation in the House of Representatives and we are working together with the local community toward enactment of this bill prior to adjournment. The issue is quite simple. The Paoli Battlefield is an unprotected Revolutionary War site that is privately owned by the Malvern Preparatory School. The School intends to sell the land in order to strengthen its endowment, but officials agreed to give the community a chance to purchase the land for historical preservation purposes. Thus, the Paoli Battlefield will become open to residential or commercial development if $2.5 million is not raised by next year to purchase the land. Our bill envisions a combination of public and private financing to purchase the battlefield and link it to the protected lands known as Valley Forge National Historical Park. Specifically, the bill authorizes a purchase price of $2.5 million with not less than $1 million in nonfederal funds. 
Too many important historical sites, especially Revolutionary War battlefields, have already been lost to residential and commercial development. The citizens of Malvern, through the Paoli Battlefield Preservation Fund, have already raised in excess of $1 million to acquire the site. Thus, if the expected $2.5 million price is maintained, adding the Paoli Battlefield to Valley Forge National Historical Park would cost the federal government no more than $1.5 million. The bill also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Borough of Malvern, which has agreed to manage the 45-acre site in perpetuity, thereby ensuring that Valley Forge will not have to expend additional federal resources for Park operations on the Paoli Battlefield. 
Mr. President, this Congress has made a commitment to protecting battlefield sites. I have been pleased to support these efforts as well as the effort to obtain funding in the FY99 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill to conduct the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Historic Preservation Study. Paoli Battlefield played an important role in the Revolutionary War, and I therefore urge my colleagues to support this effort to protect an important piece of American history. Simply put, in a $1.7 trillion federal budget, I believe that we should be able to find a maximum of $1.5 million in federal funds to preserve a rich part of our history.

Mr. SPECTER. I believe the Senator from Iowa raises a valid point on having the same scoring for the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education as for the Department of Defense. I am optimistic that in working with the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee there are ways that we can resolve these differences on policy grounds. The Senator from Iowa and I have worked very closely for many years now, when the Senator from Iowa was chairman and I was ranking--in reverse. We will move ahead with our markup in the subcommittee on September 1, the day after we get back. The chairman has agreed to have the markup on September 3 to bring this complex bill to the floor at an early date. I have taken the preliminary step in a very small meeting with Secretary Shalala of Health and Human Services and Secretary Riley of Education and Secretary Herman of Labor, to try to ascertain their real priorities so that we can try to move this bill ahead and get it passed. 
I think the Senator from Iowa is performing a real service in highlighting the necessity for similar scoring so we can have additional funds. I think we will get there. I thank my colleague for his yielding and for his cooperation this year and through the years.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues Senator Byrd and Senator Rockefeller who have worked so carefully in crafting this legislation, the Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998. Thus, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor on this bill. 
This is a major piece of legislation on behalf of a very important group of veterans. For too long, many Gulf War veterans unsuccessfully have sought promised assistance from our government for the troubling and unexplained health problems they have suffered since they returned home from the Gulf War conflict seven years ago. This bill will fill important gaps in the current health care services and compensation benefits actually being provided to these veterans. It will advance efforts to determine what happened to these veterans during their deployment that may have affected their current health. It also provides a mechanism for an independent scientific entity--the National Academy of Sciences--to identify on a scientific basis linkages between toxic substances to which Gulf War veterans were exposed during their deployment and the illnesses that many now suffer, and for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to issue regulations based on the NAS's findings creating presumptions of service connection for health care and benefits purposes for Gulf War veterans. 
This bill is the latest in a series of laws we have passed in recognition of the deep debt we owe those brave men and women who answered their country's call and put their lives on the line on behalf of us all during the Gulf War. Although that war ended quickly with relatively few immediate casualties, the long term impact of that deployment--which had as a daily reality the very real threat that Iraq would use chemical or biological weapons--was immense and unanticipated. The casualties now are those Gulf War veterans who, several years after the war, have a variety of symptoms and illnesses that fall into no set pattern but for which they still cannot get effective help from our government. This is, unfortunately, particularly true at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has as its mission the care for and compensation of veterans who fall ill as a result of their military service, and is why this bill focuses on directing the VA to take steps to remedy the situation that many Gulf War veterans find themselves in. It is clear that many Gulf War veterans are suffering from very real physical problems, many of which are still-evolving and the cause of which remains unclear. Effective treatments in many cases have yet to be identified, and even where treatment could be helpful it is not yet uniformly provided to all Gulf War veterans who seek it. And, individuals who develop health problems after their service in the Gulf continue to encounter significant problems in obtaining adequate and timely compensation benefits. 
It is true that the Department of Veterans Affairs has instituted programs and made efforts to treat Gulf War veterans. But clearly, the current realization of those efforts is not worthy of what these veterans--who have been identified as a high priority group by VA itself--deserve. As I travel through my home state of Pennsylvania, I hear over and over again the heartbreaking stories of ill Gulf War veterans and their families, who are understandably frightened about their future health prospects and are frustrated by their attempts to get timely and effective health care assistance and compensation benefits. This bill should help remove some of the barriers to obtaining these services from the VA. It should also help shift to the government the burden that in the past has too often fallen on the veteran to demonstrate that he or she is ill and why. It does this by establishing a structured means for seeking potential positive associations between troop exposures to one or more environmental hazards in the Gulf region and the unexplained illnesses that many now face every day. It compels VA to not just treat these ill veterans in isolation and on an ad hoc basis but to monitor their health status over time, and requires more research and outreach programs to make sure every potentially useful area of research into treatment as well as causation is pursued, and that Gulf War veterans know how to obtain the VA's services that are provided on their behalf. It also enhances VA's authority to implement the program for examinations of the spouses and children of these veterans under a program that we established some years ago but that VA has utterly failed to implement in a truly effective way. 
This is another opportunity for us to learn from the past and not repeat the delays or mistakes that were made in helping the veterans of previous conflicts who have suffered long term, adverse health consequences as a result of their military service. America's Gulf War veterans deserve no less.

<TEXT>
 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I introduce noncontroversial legislation which is essential to the ability of the Delaware River Port Authority to raise funds in the bond markets. Specifically, this bill clarifies that the 1987 law which repealed the thirty-year limit on bridge toll collection set by the General Bridge Act of 1946 also applies to the Delaware River Port Authority's bridges in Southeastern Pennsylvania and Southern New Jersey. It is arguable that this legislation is not necessary and that a court would construe the 1987 law in the Port Authority's favor. However, to assure certainty for the financial markets and entities considering purchasing bonds issued by the Port Authority, I believe it is worthwhile for Congress to adopt legislation making this technical clarification. 
By way of background, for many years, federal regulations governed the collection of tolls on bridges throughout the nation. Then, in the 1987 highway bill, congress repealed section 506 of the 1946 General Bridge Act which imposed a 30-year time limit on the collection of tolls. The bridges owned and operated by the Delaware River Port Authority, however, are governed by a 1952 public law by which Congress ratified the Pennsylvania-New Jersey compact establishing the Port Authority. Section 3 of that public law provided that the Port Authority's bridges were expressly exempt from the 30-year limit of the General Bridge Act and were instead subject to a 50-year limit on the collection of tolls. 
A strong case could be made that any existing statutory limit on the Port Authority was implicitly repealed by the 1987 highway bill because the limit in the 1952 compact legislation was drafted as an exception to a law that is no longer in effect (i.e., Section 506 of the General Bridge Act of 1946). However, since the 1952 Port Authority provision has not been technically repealed, I am proposing legislation to correct this oversight. 
The legislative history of the Section 3 of the Port Authority compact legislation also suggests that the 50-year toll-collection limit should no longer apply. Instead of having a lesser restriction than the 30-year limit, as was intended by Congress, if the 50-year limit were enforced, the Port Authority would be subject to a more stringent limitation on toll collection than all other American bridges. Accordingly, I believe that my legislation is consistent with the intent behind the 1987 highway law to deregulate the collection of tolls nationwide. 
The Port Authority is authorized to pledge its revenue, including that from tolls, to secure debts. To obtain financing for future economic development and to preserve the bridges it owns and operates, the Port Authority must have a guaranteed revenue stream. Although a court very likely would rule that the fifty-year limit on toll collection was implicitly repealed by the Highway Act of 1987, without direct legislation to that effect, the Port Authority's bond counsel suggests it will be unable to borrow in the financial markets. 
The importance of ensuring this borrowing ability is reflected in the Port Authority's essential role in the economic development of Southeastern Pennsylvania and Southern New Jersey. The Port Authority owns and operates the Benjamin Franklin, Betsy Ross, Commodore Barry, and Walt Whitman bridges as well as the mass transit PATCO High Speed Line. The Port Authority is involved in port unification through another of its subsidiaries, the Port of Philadelphia and Camden. Finally, the Port Authority has been instrumental in regional development and the commercial revitalization of the Philadelphia-Camden waterfront. Its programs include the addition of public attractions at Penns Landing and the Camden Aquarium as well as low-interest loans to expand Philadelphia's American Street Enterprise Zone. 
Given the importance of revitalizing the Delaware River region, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on the Senate Appropriations Committee's decision to provide funding to reopen the Erie National Weather Service office at least in part starting this Fall. Congressman English and I were in Erie in April for meetings with local officials and residents on this important issue and our appropriations success is a direct result of that visit. During that visit, I once again heard the troubling litany of severe weather incidents in Erie, which include blizzards and tornadoes which went unreported and put thousands of residents at risk. 
I am pleased that Chairman Gregg was able to fulfill part of my request regarding the National Weather Service's activities in the Erie area and wanted to confirm with him that it is our understanding that pursuant to the language in this bill, the agency will undertake mitigation activities which will include having Weather Service personnel in the Erie office 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, for 6 months beginning October 1, 1998. 
I will continue to focus with Congressman English and Senator Santorum on our goal of reopening the Erie office permanently and ensuring that the office is equipped with the most advanced forecasting equipment available in the federal government. The six-month reopening of the office represents a good interim fix and I thank the Chairman for his help.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on the inclusion in the bill of $4 million at my request for the deployment of an intelligent transportation system project across the Delaware River. I sought these funds at the request of the Delaware River Port Authority, which is implementing electronic toll and traffic management systems for the Ben Franklin, Walt Whitman, Commodore Barry, and Betsy Ross Bridges in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Delaware region, which are operated and maintained by the Authority and serve thousands of drivers each day, including substantial commercial traffic. 
I believe that it is critical that we do all that is possible to alleviate traffic congestion on these important river crossings, for the sake of improving the quality of life of area residents and others who drive on the bridges and to reduce air pollution in Philadelphia and its suburbs. 
I thank the Chairman for including funds for deployment of an ITS system over the Delaware River, which will benefit both Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Mr. President, I agree with the arguments made both by the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Illinois that it is very useful to have a Federal crackdown on those who violate the law with guns. When I was district attorney in Philadelphia, I sought to have the Board of Judges impose a standard rule that there be at least some jail time for those who violate the law with guns, and was unsuccessful in that effort. 
One of the first pieces of legislation I introduced on coming to the Senate provided for the armed career criminal bill, which mandates a sentence of 15 years to life for a career criminal who has been found in possession of a firearm. 
I am pleased the legislation offered by the Senator from Idaho will encompass the City of Philadelphia on a Federal crackdown. 
Let me say, parenthetically, this is the first opportunity I have had to take the Senate floor. I thank my colleagues for the standing ovation which I received when I returned and thank them for the very many good wishes. 
I wish I had longer to talk about this issue. But I do believe the Federal jurisdiction, with the speedy trial rules and the tougher sentencing and the avoidance, at least in my experience, in the Philadelphia State courts of judge shopping and plea bargaining, will be a great boon to cracking down on those who violate the law with guns. 
Just a word or two about a couple of earlier votes. I supported the proposition to allow counsel into the grand jury room. That is sort of an onerous proceeding, where the prosecutor is present with the witness and up to 23 grand jurors. It is a little anomalous, given the right to counsel, that the witness must appear alone in the grand jury room, which is a closed Star Chamber proceeding, but I think the orderly administration of criminal justice will be served better if a witness' counsel is permitted to be present. 
An earlier vote, too, occurred on an effort by the Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions, to allocate more funds to law enforcement as opposed to rehabilitation. I supported the motion to table Senator Sessions' amendment because I believe there ought to be more on the seamless web for rehabilitation.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleagues, Chairman Gregg and Senator Hollings, for including in this legislation $5 million to cover initial costs of establishing a War Crimes Tribunal for prosecution of Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi government officials for crimes committed during the Gulf War and afterward. 
I sought these funds in a letter to Chairman Gregg dated April 24, 1998, because I believe it is critical that we have the prosecutorial infrastructure in place to deal with Iraqi war crimes. I also noted in my letter that every effort must be made to obtain contributions from our allies and other U.N. member countries for this vital effort. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues as this bill moves forward to ensure that these funds are retained in Conference.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues, Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonso D'Amato, to introduce a bill that will keep high paying jobs in the domestic tailored wool apparel industry in America. This bill will suspend the duty on certain high quality wool fabrics used in American garment manufacturing. 
The duty rates on imported wool fabrics continued to be among the highest rates imposed on products in the U.S. tariff schedules. Because the duty on these fabrics exceeds the duty on imported garments by about 20 percent, the duty schedule penalizes those American companies which keep their production here in the U.S. 
A special `finished product' concession made in the Canada Free Trade Agreement (and later NAFTA) has greatly exacerbated the problem. The concession allows Canadian companies to use imported, duty-free wool fabric to manufacture men's suits, which are in turn shipped duty-free into the U.S. As a result, over the past decade Canadian shipments of suits into the U.S. have surged from nearly zero to approximately one and a half million units shipped annually. 
During the same time frame, production by the U.S. tailored clothing industry has dropped 40 percent and the number of employees has been cut in almost half, from 58,000 to 30,000 employees. In my home state of Pennsylvania, the high-end tailored men's clothing industry provides high paying jobs in the cities of Reading, Ashland, Easton, Shippensberg and Philadelphia, but since 1991, Pennsylvania has lost over 3000 jobs due to plant closings. 
This duty has a real, direct and substantial effect on American jobs. Suspension of the duty on these fabrics will level the playing field with foreign manufacturers and allow the U.S. industry to compete, saving American jobs. I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its adoption.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to authorize the Interior Department to enter into an agreement with the nonprofit Gateway Visitor Center Corporation for the construction and operation of the Gateway Visitor Center in Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
This legislation is needed because the Visitor Center will provide some services which are beyond the scope of existing National Park Service statutory authority at the Park. As a result, I am advised that construction may not begin until this bill is enacted. I have worked with the National Park Service and the Gateway Visitor Center Corporation to develop this bill and note that similar legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressmen Jon Fox and Robert Borski. The bill also has the strong support of Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell. 
The Gateway Visitor Center is part of the revitalization of Independence Mall and is critical to creating an outstanding visitor experience. It will serve as the gateway into the Park and will orient visitors as to the rich history of the National Historical Park, the city of Philadelphia, and the region as a whole. I was pleased to assist in obtaining funds in the TEA-21 Act for the road and infrastructure improvements necessary for the redevelopment of the Independence Mall and would note that the Senate FY99 Interior Appropriations bill also includes funding for this project. 
The legislation is necessary because, in addition to its role as the Park's primary visitor center, the Gateway Visitor Center will be permitted to charge fees, conduct events, and sell merchandise, tickets, and food to visitors to the Center. These activities will allow the Gateway Visitor Center to meet its park-wide, city-wide and regional missions while defraying the operating and management expenses of the Center. 
The Gateway Visitor Center holds enormous potential for Independence National Historical Park and the greater Philadelphia region as a whole, and I urge my colleague to support this legislation.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to thank the Managers for agreeing to accept my amendment on campus crime reporting, which is based on legislation (S. 2100) I introduced on May 20, 1998. 
As a lead sponsor of the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990, I have been very concerned about what I perceive as the Department of Education's ineffective implementation of the Act's crime offense reporting requirements. On March 5, 1998, I held an oversight hearing on campus security issues as Chairman of the Senate Labor, Health, and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee. At that hearing, Assistant Secretary for postsecondary Education David Longanecker testified that the Department does not require colleges to report offenses occurring on sidewalks, streets and other public lands within what ordinarily would be considered a `campus.' He also testified that buildings which are owned by a college but used for commercial purposes (such as a leased food court) do not fall within the Department's interpretation of `campus.' 
I believe that the omission of such information violates the spirit of the law and is a disservice to parents and students because commercial property such as food shops and retail stores and streets thread through a campus and must be visited or traveled in the course of one's studies. I was further troubled to hear testimony at the hearing that the Department has not imposed civil penalties on any school for failure to comply with the Act. 
The best means of improving the implementation of the 1990 law is the enactment of the statutory clarifications included in my amendment, which redefines `campus' and requires the imposition of civil penalties where applicable. 
I am grateful that the Managers have agreed to name these provisions of law in honor of Jeanne Clery, the daughter of Howard and Connie Clery of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, who was brutally raped and murdered at Lehigh University in 1986. After that tragic incident, the Clerys founded Security on Campus, Inc., a non-profit dedicated to improving safety on our nation's college campuses. The Clerys brought the campus crime reporting issue to my attention in 1989 and it is highly fitting that after so many years of being inspired by their work on this issue, Congress will recognize Jeanne Clery in this manner. 
I am hopeful that my amendment will be preserved in conference with the House and again thank my colleagues for their efforts on this issue.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I introduce legislation today to grant a Cost-of-Living-Adjustment (COLA) increase, to take effect at the beginning of next year, to recipients of certain Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits. 
Mr. President, this legislation is simple and straightforward. It would grant a COLA increase to recipients of various VA benefits--most notably, compensation benefits received by veterans with service-connected disabilities, and the Dependency and Indemnity Compensation or `DIC' benefits received by the survivors of veterans who died in service or died after service as a result of service-connected injuries or illnesses. The COLA to be awarded under this legislation would be, as in past years, the same COLA awarded to recipients of Social Security benefits.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to return to my Senate duties today after a relatively brief period of convalescence following by-pass surgery at Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, one of our nation's great medical institutions. 
This experience has again led me to marvel at our health care system and to make me more determined than ever to support federal funding for biomedical research and to make health care available to all Americans. 
At Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, I was the beneficiary of outstanding hospital care and a superbly qualified medical team headed by renowned cardiologist, Dr. Howard Weitz and distinguished surgeons Dr. Richard Edie and Dr. James Diehl. (Dr. Weitz has assisted me for many years going back to his student days when he volunteered for my campaign for Mayor of Philadelphia.) 
My concern about health care has long pre-dated my own personal benefits from the MRI and other diagnostic and curative procedures. My concern about health care began many years ago and has been intensified by my service on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education which I now have the honor to chair. 
As the Record shows, I have introduced and cosponsored legislation going back to the 98th Congress designed to provide health care coverage to all Americans. Among my proposals were the Health Care Cost Containment Act of 1983 (S. 2051), the Community Based Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Projects Act of 1985 (S. 1873), the Health Care Affordability and Quality Improvement Act of 1992 (S. 3176), the Comprehensive Health Care Act of 1993 (S. 18), the Health Care Assurance Acts of 1995 and 1997 (S. 18 and S. 24), and the Healthy Children's Pilot Program Act of 1997. 
In conjunction with the distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee, Senator Tom Harkin, our Subcommittee has taken the lead to increase NIH funding from $11.3 billion in FY95 to $11.9 billion in FY96 to $12.7 billion in FY97 to $13.6 billion in FY98. This year we are targeting an increase of $2 billion which will be difficult considering the Subcommittee's other priorities; but, I think, attainable. 
I have long been convinced that our Federal budget of $1,700,000,000,000 could provide sufficient funding for America's needs if we establish our real priorities. The real question is whether we have enough doctors, hospitals, medical personnel, etc. to take care of Americans in need of medical attention. I am convinced that we do. The part which has yet to be accomplished is to work out the financing for the delivery of such health care. As specified in the legislation which I have introduced, I am convinced that sufficient savings are possible within the current system to provide health care to all Americans within the current expenditures. 
I return to the Senate today with renewed commitment that every American should have the quality medical care I had at Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University. In recognition of health care providers everywhere in America, I consider it appropriate to identify, compliment and thank members of the medical team which provided my superb medical care at Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University: 
Dr. Stephen McNulty, Dr. Michael Savage, Dr. Herbert Patrick, Dr. Beckie Michael, Dr. Geno Merli, Dr. Arnold Greenspon, Dr. A. J. DiMarino, Dr. Rodney Bell, Dr. Phyllis Flomemerg and the following nurses: Leslie Amme, Grace Baillargeon, Tara Baldino, Jenna Briggs, Kathleen Bryan-Donahue, Susan Burton, Joanne Cannon, Mary Cavanaugh, Stephanie Cozzi, Danielle Delpais, Nancy Derivan, Linda Dib, Pam Dioguardo, Tim Dunn, Diane Ellingsworth, Robin Estadt, Marcia Gazdzinski, Debbie Granese, Karen Hartnett, Suzanne Henrick, Kelly Hollenbach, Charles Huckel, Suzanne James-Harmon, Leonida Josue-Peralta, Eileen C.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this measure expresses the sense of the Congress regarding the murder of U.S. citizens by Palestinian terrorists. This resolution addresses specific concerns that I have regarding the failure of the Palestinian Authority to apprehend and bring to justice perpetrators of terrorist acts involving American citizens who have been killed in recent months and years in terrorist attacks in Israel. A companion resolution, introduced by Congressman Jon Fox, passed the House by a vote of 406-0 on May 5, 1998. 
Since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, at least nine American citizens in Israel have been killed by Palestinian terrorists. They are our parents, our children, and our citizens. The traditional policy of our nation has been to pursue and apprehend any terrorists who have killed American citizens abroad. This in no way contravenes or conflicts with either international or constitutional law. While criminal jurisdiction is customarily limited to the place where the crime occurred, it is well established constitutional doctrine that Congress has the power to apply U.S. law extra territorially if it so chooses. United States versus Bowman, 260 U.S. 94, 98 (1922). It was on the basis of this doctrine that I spearheaded efforts to enact the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986, which extended the reach of U.S. criminal jurisdiction to acts of violence perpetrated against Americans anywhere in the world. But, making murder committed by terrorists a U.S. crime will not, on its own, protect Americans abroad. We must also demonstrate our seriousness by applying the law regularly and consistently. 
At the heart of the Anti-Terrorism Act was the fundamental notion that international terrorists are criminals and ought to be treated as such--they should be promptly located, apprehended, and brought to trial for their heinous crimes. The United States government in conjunction with the government of Israel knows the location of 10 of the 20 terrorists suspected in the murders of these United States citizens. I am aware that from March 6-10, an interagency task force comprised of individuals from the Department of State, Justice Department, FBI and National Security Commission was in Israel in the Palestinian controlled areas to investigate the deaths of these Americans. Cooperation from the Palestinian Authority is critical as investigative authorities attempt to discover and develop evidence for prosecution. However, the Palestinian Authority has failed to cooperate and has not honored requests for the transfer of many of these suspects. 
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 provides the necessary subject matter jurisdiction to prosecute those who attack U.S. citizens abroad. But, to obtain personal jurisdiction over the culprits themselves, the suspect must first be seized or arrested and brought to the United States to stand trial. Under current constitutional doctrine, both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals can be seized and brought to stand trial in the United States without violating due process of law. Frisbie versus Collins, 342 U.S. 519, 522 (1952). 
My resolution calls for the United States to demand the prosecution of all suspected perpetrators of these attacks against United States citizens by seeking the cooperation of the Palestinian Authority and all other appropriate authorities in the prosecution of these cases. In addition, my resolution calls for these suspects to be tried in the United States unless it is determined that such action is contrary to effective prosecution. 
We must utilize all our laws properly and remain persistent in seeking justice for these American families. We must remain vigilant in our search for all suspected perpetrators of these atrocious attacks against U.S. citizens. I urge my colleagues to support this measure and to help push for justice in this important matter.

Mr. SPECTER. I would like to engage the Chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator D'Amato in a colloquy regarding a Pennsylvania mass transit project. It is my understanding that the project under the transit new start program entitled `Philadelphia-Pittsburgh High Speed Rail' is intended to be for initial planning, design and engineering costs for a high speed magnetic levitation public transportation system in Pennsylvania. Having ridden such a system in Germany in January of this year, I believe a system of this nature will revolutionize the steel industry and could provide an excellent means of mass transit in the 21st Century.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while I am very pleased with the allocations for Pennsylvania, I am voting against the ISTEA conference report because the offsets hit the veterans' accounts so hard. 
I compliment House of Representatives Chairman Bud Shuster and Senate Chairman John Chafee on their extraordinary diligence and accomplishments as lead negotiators on this mammoth bill. I work closely with them in Pennsylvania's infrastructure's needs and I thank them for the accommodations on Pennsylvania's roads, bridges and mass transit systems. 
In seeking total offsets of $17.7 billion, the veterans' accounts have been hit for $15.367 billion and 86.8% of the total offsets. As the Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a chief advocate for veterans' interests, I believe this is excessively disproportion. 
There is an additional $25 billion in the highway trust fund. I am advised that $25 billion will yield approximately $6 billion in interest over the next six years. Those funds could have been used for the offset or at least part of the offset; or other funds could have been found for a part of the offset. 
Accordingly, I register this protest vote. 
My concern for this veterans' offset is consistent with my position during consideration of the FY '99 Budget Resolution when I opposed this large offset in the veterans' accounts. I shall work to try to recoup these offsets from the veterans' accounts as we move forward in the appropriations process.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in introducing the Biden-Specter `Violence Against Women Act II' (VAWA II), a bipartisan effort to continue and strengthen the many vital Federal programs which work to combat violence against women. I thank Senator Biden in particular for his leadership in crafting this important legislation. 
Clearly, violence against women knows no social, economic, or geographic bounds. It affects rich and poor, young and old. Women are assaulted in their homes, on the streets, in the workplace, and on campuses. In 1992, I cosponsored the original `Violence Against Women Act' (VAWA), which amended other anti-violence legislation to include acts of violence against women as crimes. Although it did not pass that year, we worked hard to include this vital legislation in the 1994 omnibus anti-crime legislation. Since enactment of the Violence Against Women Act, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have worked to ensure that programs under this law are funded adequately. 
Domestic violence in particular is an epidemic which VAWA programs seek to address. Within the last year, 3.9 million American women were victims of physical abuse and another 20.7 million were verbally or emotionally abused by their spouse or partner. A recent study found that the medical costs associated with these attacks amount to over $857.3 million. In my State of Pennsylvania, more than 500,000 citizens will be victims of domestic violence each year, and the estimated medical cost exceeds $326 million. In 1995 and 1996, I held hearings in Pennsylvania on the issue of domestic violence and violence against women in general, and have visited battered women's shelters in Pittsburgh and Harrisburg to see first-hand the kind of physical and emotional suffering so many women endure. 
Within the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, which I chair, Violence Against Women Act programs received $128.7 million for fiscal year 1998. I have also supported Violence Against Women Act programs funded within the Department of Justice, which totaled $270.7 million for fiscal year 1998. 
The Biden-Specter VAWA II legislation extends and expands the vital VAWA programs supported by my Subcommittee. Currently funded at $76.5 million, Shelters for Battered Women and Their Children would double its authorization in four years. The National Domestic Violence Hotline, which has received over 120,000 calls since February 1996, is another successful resource which would receive a substantial increase in its authorization. The VAWA II proposal would authorize an additional $15 million over four years for the Rape Prevention and Education Program, currently at $45 million, and would institute new coordination between the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to administer the CDC Prevention and Intervention Research to Combat Violence Against Women. 
The Biden-Specter VAWA II legislation also includes provisions to address the issue of violence against women on college campuses across the country. Recognizing the grave importance of battling this problem in a targeted manner, I introduced the `Campus Crime Disclosure Act of 1998' (S. 2100) on May 20, 1998. Sexual assaults throughout the United States, including sexual assaults on campuses, are on the rise. Independent research and studies show that 20 percent of college-aged women will be victims of sexual crimes at some point in their postsecondary academic career. Studies also show that rape remains the most underreported violent crime in America, with approximately one in every six rapes reported to police. The Campus Crime Disclosure Act, tightens existing campus security law to discourage higher educational institutions from the underreporting of offenses covered by the 1990 Campus Security Act. 
I have also continuously worked to ensure that women receive the benefit of the Federal investment into public health programs. I helped establish the Public Health Service's Office of Women's Health in 1991, which develops, coordinates, and stimulates women's health programs and activities across all Federal agencies. Funding for this program has increased from $450,000 in fiscal year 1991 to $12.5 million in fiscal year 1998. Even in an era of constrained spending, these expenditures are well worthwhile on this important subject. 
I believe that by the passage of legislation such as the Biden-Specter Violence Against Women Act II, we are on the right track to helping women to combat the incidence of domestic violence, and victimization in general. I urge my colleagues to join in cosponsoring this important legislation, and I urge its swift adoption.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Campus Crime Disclosure Act of 1998. My legislation amends the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990, 
Educational institutions were once safe havens where we sent our children. Unfortunately, today we are all aware of the increase in violence that has reached as far down as our elementary schools to our youngest and most innocent victims. I would note that just recently, in the rural Pennsylvania community of Edinboro, a young teenager lamentably shot a teacher to death at an 8th grade graduation dance and wounded other students. While there is much that Congress can do to reduce violence in our society and across all levels of educational institutions, my legislation is focused on our national commitment to improving public safety on college and university campuses, where young adults are often away from their homes for the first time and living in unfamiliar surroundings. 
The legislation I am introducing today builds upon the fine work of my distinguished colleagues, Representative Goodling of Pennsylvania and Senator Jeffords of Vermont, who as chairmen of the authorizing committees having jurisdiction over higher education, have included campus crime amendments in the legislation reauthorizing the Higher Education Act. However, I believe that their amendments to the 1990 Campus Security Act do not go far enough. Accordingly, my legislation includes provisions which are not included in the reauthorization bill and are necessary to bring schools into full compliance with the law, such as a more detailed definition of `campus' and new civil penalties. 
Based on my experience as District Attorney of Philadelphia, and my frequent involvement with educators and college students, I know that safety on campuses is a very serious issue. I want to recognize one family in particular for helping keep me and my colleagues informed on the important issue of campus crime, Howard and Connie Clery, and their son Ben, of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania for their continued work on campus security policy. As my colleagues may know, in 1988, the Clerys' daughter, Jeanne, was beaten, raped and murdered by a fellow student in her campus dormitory room at Lehigh University. Soon after the tragedy, Howard and Connie began to work on getting campus safety laws passed in the States and the U.S. Congress. In fact, the campus security law enacted in 1990 is often referred to as the `Clery Bill.' The Clerys founded Security on Campus, Inc., which serves as a watchdog of campus crime policies and procedures administered by our nation's colleges and universities. 
Based on continued conversations with the Clerys, it became apparent to me that there was a critical need for Congressional oversight of how the Department of Education has implemented the 1990 Act and whether the Department's financial resources are adequate for enforcement of the reporting requirements. On the fifth of March of this year, I held a hearing on security on campus as chairman of the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, to examine the Department of Education's enforcement of campus crime reporting requirements. The Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education for the U.S. Department of Education, David Longanecker, testified that: `Generally the issue of campus is one of the foremost difficult areas that we have found campuses are having a difficult 
time with, and it is a particular issue for an urban institution.' Secretary Longanecker went on to say that sidewalks and public lands are excluded from the Department's current definition of campus. Further, testimony at the hearing showed that buildings which are used for commercial purposes where other parts are used for educational purposes do not fall within the Department's interpretation of `campus,' which, my own personal view, is an incorrect one. As one of the authors of the 1990 law, I believe that the omission of such information violates the spirit of the law and is a disservice to parents and students, especially for parents who send their children to college in urban settings, where commercial property such as food shops and retail stores and city streets thread through the entire campus. I believe it is preposterous to suggest that if a student fell victim to a crime say on a sidewalk which he or she was using to get to class would go unreported. 
The Campus Crime Disclosure Act of 1998 clarifies the law as to what constitutes a college or university campus. From now on, institutions would have to report to parents, students, and other members of the general public a more precise assessment of the criminal activity on campus. Specifically, a campus will be interpreted to mean: any building or property owned and controlled by the institution or owned by a student organization recognized by the institution, any public property such as sidewalks, streets, parking facilities, and other thoroughfares that provide access to the facilities of the institution, and any property owned or controlled by the institution that is not in close proximity to the campus must still be reported on. The bill also makes clear that all dormitories and residential facilities, whether on or off-campus, which are owned or operated by the institution, fall under the definition of campus. 
My legislation gives the Secretary of Education stronger enforcement authority. Should an institution fail to report crime data, the Department of Education can fine that institution up to $25,000. According to a study conducted by the General Accounting Office, 63 institutions of higher education were in violation of the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990. Yet, the Department of Education did not take any punitive action against these institutions. The inclusion of fines will provide the Department with the necessary tool to ensure that all schools fulfill the intention of the law. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of the Campus Crime Disclosure Act of 1998 to enhance security on campus. The bill is urgently needed to steer the U.S. Department of Education in the right direction as it monitors crime on America's college campuses. Quite simply, everyone benefits from clear and accurate reporting of the risks facing college students.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to compliment the House of Representatives on passage of legislation this afternoon to take a stand against religious persecution worldwide. 
And, I compliment Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia for his leadership on this very important legislation. 
Legislation is pending in the U.S. Senate identical with or very similar to the legislation passed in the House--I am not sure what amendments may have been crafted on the House floor this afternoon and what last-minute changes may have been made--but similar legislation has been introduced by this Senator in the U.S. Senate. And the purpose of this legislation is for the United States to take a stand against religious persecution worldwide. 
We have a very unfortunate situation today where Catholic priests are being incarcerated in China, Buddhists are being persecuted in Tibet, and Evangelical Christians are being imprisoned in Saudi Arabia and in Egypt. The essence of freedom of religion is a very fundamental value in the United States and a very fundamental moral value. And, the legislation which passed the House today and which is pending in the Senate will enable the U.S. Government to take a stand against this religious persecution worldwide. 
Freedom of religion is the first part of the first amendment. The United States was founded for religious freedom. The Pilgrims came here in 1607 for that purpose, as did my father Harry Specter, who literally walked across Europe with barely a ruble in his pocket in 1911 seeking a new life for himself and a family which he hoped to have, and religious freedom, because the Cossacks rode up and down the streets of Batchkurina, a small village in Ukraine, in Russia, where my father's brother, Mordechai Spectorski, had fought with the Cossacks, and they were looking for Mordechai Spectorski, who had fled the city. And, the Cossacks continued to look for members of the Specter family. My father immigrated to the United States, as did my mother Lillie Shanin, leaving a small town on the Russian-Polish border at the age of 5, coming to the United States in 1905. 
The legislation which has passed the House of Representatives has some sanctions in it. It provides that there be no weapons of torture sold, and provides limitations as to what U.S. taxpayer money can be given for, other than humanitarian purposes. And, it seems to me that if the legislation is to have any effect, there have to be sanctions, there have to be weapons in the bill--teeth--in order to promote compliance. 
I visited this past January in Saudi Arabia and talked to Saudi officials about concerns which I have and which others have had where Christians cannot display a Christmas tree in a window if it is visible from the outside, where Jewish soldiers are reluctant to wear their dog tags identifying themselves as being Jewish, a situation which is intolerable, where we have some 5,000 young men and women who are in Saudi Arabia to protect the Saudis. 
The situation in Egypt is very serious where there are Evangelical Christians who are being persecuted, where they land in jail if there is a conversion from Islam to Christianity. I was unable to visit the Sudan because of difficulties there, but visiting in nearby Eritrea, I heard stories about the persecution of Christians in Sudan. 
It is my hope that this legislation will be considered by the Senate in short order so that a firm stand will be taken to deal with the very serious issue of religious persecution worldwide. 
Again, I compliment the House and chief sponsor, Frank Wolf, and look forward to enactment of this legislation in the Senate. The bill passed by a vote of 375-41, which is well beyond the number necessary to be veto proof. The administration has been opposed to having sanctions in legislation, sanctions such as some of the ones proposed in the bill which I have offered and is pending in the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from New York for his comments about the problems with nuclear proliferation. I thank my colleague from Nebraska for commenting about discussions that we have had over the years about the issues of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
I intend to speak directly to a subject that I had talked to the Senator from Nebraska about, and that is the need to have activism by the President of the United States in trying to deal with nuclear proliferation on the subcontinent. In fact, Senator Hank Brown and I had visited with Indian Prime Minister Rao in August of 1995 and also with Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. I then wrote to the President on this precise subject. I intend to discuss that at some length during the course of the remarks that I am about to make. 
I believe that the nuclear detonation in India makes it more important than ever that the United States move ahead with leadership to try to defuse the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and that the Senate should act promptly to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
We have had, already, in the course of the last 24 hours, indications of a chain reaction. We have had a response from Pakistan that they may well, too, test nuclear weapons. We have had a report from North Korea, which appears in this morning's press, that `North Korean officials have announced that they are suspending their efforts to carry out the 1994 nuclear freeze agreement that was intended to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program. United States officials said the program was intended to produce weapons in North Korea.' 
So we see what is happening on the international scene. There needs to be a very positive response by the United States to the likes of these very, very threatening developments.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have again sought recognition to comment on the issue relating to the conditions which have been set by the U.S. Government on a further meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and the difference of opinion of what is adequate to handle the security interests of the State of Israel. It is my view that it was inappropriate and counterproductive for the U.S. Government to deliver what I consider to be an ultimatum to Prime Minister Netanyahu that he accept the further redeployment of Israeli forces as a precondition to come to Washington to meet with the President on last Monday, May 11. 
Secretary of State Albright briefed a number of Senators yesterday in a room, S. 407, where we have secret discussions, and at that time the Secretary of State said that she had not delivered an ultimatum but instead had stated conditions which would have to be met before the United States would continue to carry forward with the peace process on the current track. 
I responded to the Secretary of State that I thought it wasn't even a difference of semantics to say that a condition on further discussions did not constitute an ultimatum, that in fact it was clearly an ultimatum in those discussions. 
If the diplomacy is carried out in a quiet way, so be it. But when diplomacy is carried out publicly and where the Prime Minister of another country is put in the position where the Prime Minister has to back down, it seems to me totally counterproductive and unlikely to produce a result where there will be agreement or compliance even if Prime Minister Netanyahu had wanted to do that. 
When it comes to the question of the security interests of Israel, I do not believe that anybody can second-guess the security interests of Israel except the Israelis and their Government. The view from the Potomac is a lot different than the view from the Jordan River as it has been said on many, many occasions. And Israel has been fighting more than 100 million Arabs for more than 50 years. They have won quite a number of wars, but they only have to lose one war before it is all over. 
Secretary of Defense William Cohen appeared today before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, and I asked the Secretary of Defense whether he or anybody in his department had carried out an analysis as to the adequacy of security for Israel if Israel agreed to the proposal of the administration. I commented in the course of that question that I would not think, even if the United States had made that kind of a determination, it would be binding and might not even be relevant as to what Israel thought was necessary for its own security. Secretary of Defense Cohen said that no such analysis had been made on his part. But it would seem to me that as an indispensable prerequisite for the U.S. Government to take a position that Israel ought to have certain withdrawal at least there ought to be a professional determination that the withdrawal would be consistent with Israel's security interests. But as I say, the Secretary of Defense had not undertaken that kind of an analysis. 
I submit that the issue of Israel's security is something that has to be judged by the Government of Israel. There is no doubt about the friendship and support of President Clinton's administration for Israel. I do not question that for a minute. But where you have the negotiations at a very, very critical point and public statements are made as a precondition which is realistically viewed an ultimatum, pure and simple, that is totally wholly inappropriate. It is my hope that these peace negotiations can be put back on track. I know that the Secretary of State is going to be meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu later today. The Appropriations Committee has a meeting scheduled with Prime Minister Netanyahu tomorrow. I hope we can find our way through these negotiations and put the peace negotiations back on track. 
I think it is a very difficult matter because while the administration is pressing Israel for a certain level of withdrawal, there are many items which are not being taken care of by the Palestinian authority. 
Last year, Prime Minister Netanyahu had said that Arafat had given a green light to certain terrorist activities by the Palestinian Authority. And when Secretary of State Albright was before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I asked the question as to whether there had been, in fact, a green light given by Chairman Arafat, as charged by Prime Minister Netanyahu. Secretary of State Albright made the statement that it wasn't a green light, but there wasn't a red light either. 
I think it is mandatory that the Palestinian Authority give such a red light. They cannot be guarantors, but a red light and their maximum effort to stop terrorism is required. Under the provisions of an amendment introduced by Senator Shelby and myself, that kind of a maximum effort against terrorism is a precondition for getting any aid from the United States. 
So, these matters are obviously delicate. They require a lot of diplomatic tact. It is my hope that the current stalemate can be surmounted, but I think it can be surmounted only if there is a recognition, as former Secretary of State Warren Christopher had, that security is a matter for the discretion of Israel--it is Israel's security--and that no ultimatum be issued, or at least no precondition be issued, before the Prime Minister of Israel can proceed to have a meeting or negotiations with the United States. 
In the absence of any other Senator on the floor seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. This legislation provides funding for the federal crop insurance program, important agricultural research programs and the restoration of food stamp benefits to approximately 250,000 legal immigrants. 
I have long been a strong supporter of federal nutrition programs that help to combat hunger. On November 24, 1997, Senator Harkin and I sent a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and Director of the Office of Management and Budget Franklin Raines, which was signed by forty-five of our Senate colleagues. Our letter urged the Administration to provide funding for food stamp benefits for some of the most vulnerable members of our society: legal immigrants who are children, elderly, or disabled. 
As the Agricultural Research bill was sent to conference, I joined with four of my colleagues in a March 23, 1998 letter urging the conferees to provide relief to poor legal immigrants and refugees who previously were eligible but had lost federal food stamps under the 1996 welfare law. I am pleased that the final conference report restores these benefits. I also joined seventy of my colleagues in an April 24, 1998 letter urging that the conference report be brought to the floor for a vote as soon as possible. 
Besides providing food stamp benefits to vulnerable legal immigrants, this bill also provides critical funding for the federal crop insurance program, which will allow affordable crop insurance to be offered to our nation's farmers. Agriculture is Pennsylvania's number one industry, and it is vital that we provide insurance to our farmers who work so hard to provide our country and the world with a stable food supply. The legislation will also provide $600 million over the next five years in funding for agricultural research programs, which are critical to our country's efforts to produce enough food for an ever-increasing world population. 
The Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act is an important piece of legislation, for legal immigrants, our nation's agricultural community, and the nation as a whole. I am therefore pleased to support this legislation.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have sought recognition to express my support for the Medicare subvention demonstration project legislation which has been introduced by Senator Jeffords. This important legislation was approved by the Senate last year as part of the Balanced Budget Act, but the measure was stricken from the final version of that legislation in conference. I hope that this year, the House will recede from its objections, and we can send this legislation, which is supported by the Administration, to the President for his signature. 
This bill would begin the process of opening a new--and vitally needed--source of funding for the provision of health care services by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It would grant to VA, on a demonstration project basis, the authority to collect and retain funds from Medicare--just as VA collects reimbursement funds from veterans' private insurance carriers--for the costs associated with treating Medicare-eligible veterans' non-service-connected illnesses and injuries. 
The Balanced Budget Act specifies that appropriated funding for the provision of health care services by VA will be flat over the next five fiscal years. At the same time, 7.7 million World War II veterans and 4.5 million Korean War veterans--veterans who are eligible for Medicare benefits--will require extensive heath care assistance as they age. It is critical that these veterans be allowed to bring their Medicare benefits to VA so that VA might be better able to meet their needs. 
This legislation will surely assist VA by providing a new revenue stream. But it will also benefit Medicare. Under the plan set out in this legislation, VA would be reimbursed at a level not to exceed 95% of the rate Medicare would otherwise pay a private hospital for care supplied to a Medicare-eligible veterans. In summary, under this legislation Medicare would receive care for its veteran beneficiaries at a discount, and VA would receive a vitally needed new source of funding. 
Medicare subvention legislation is supported by all of the members of the Veterans Affairs Committee. It is supported by the Administration. All of the major veterans' service organizations have urged enactment of this legislation. And, as I previously noted, the Senate approved this legislation last year as part of the Senate-approved Balanced Budget Act. 
I am pleased to add my name to this bill as a cosponsor, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. SPECTER. This Sunday, May 10, 1998, the U.S. Senate will lose its last 30-something Member--that is someone who is in the thirties--because our colleague, Senator Rick Santorum will turn 40. 
Already, in a few short years, Senator Santorum has distinguished himself by building a solid record of legislative achievement in both the House of Representatives and in the U.S. Senate. 
As Senator Santorum passes this personal milestone, I would like to make a comment or two about him. He was born on May 10, 1958, in Winchester, VA, the son of an Italian immigrant. In 1965, the family moved to Butler, PA. 
He had a distinguished career at Penn State, worked for Senator John Heinz, then moved on to the University of Pittsburgh where he earned his M.B.A., and then to the Dickinson School of Law where he earned a J.D. 
He served six years as a top aide in the Pennsylvania State Senate, and then worked four years as an associate at the Pittsburgh law firm of Kirkpatrick and Lockhart. 
In 1990, Senator Santorum took on a campaign for the Congress and defeated a seventh-term incumbent at the age of 32. Then in the House his legislation was very noteworthy on fiscal responsibility, health care, creative medical savings accounts, which was incorporated as a pilot project in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. He has distinguished himself in the U.S. Senate with important legislation on welfare reform, managing debate on legislation based largely on a bill which he had introduced in the House of Representatives. 
I have worked very closely with Senator Santorum on a personal basis. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that when Senator Santorum won election in November of 1994 he `cautiously" invited me to accompany him on a victory swing the next day in Scranton and Philadelphia. 
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported accurately, `If you want me to go, Rick, I'll be there.' And then the Post-Gazette noted, `It was just another display of what has become one of the more unusual U.S. Senate alliances and odd pairing of politicians from opposite poles in the Republican Party . . .' 
Senator Santorum and I have more in common than one might imagine. 
We are both children of immigrants. We both appreciated the value of education, and have been able to participate in the American dream because of our education. We agree on many, many items. We both support welfare reform, the balanced budget, the line-item veto, and the death penalty. On the issue of pro-choice and pro-life, Senator Santorum and I try to find ways to bring people together. 
It is a pleasure for me to salute Senator Santorum on one of the last remaining days of his 39 years. He will not be able to say, like Jack Benny, very much longer that he is 39. 
One of the items, in closing, that I would like to note is that the sky is the limit for Senator Santorum, and if he decides to stay in the U.S. Senate, he could be elected in the year 2000, the year 2006, the year 2012, the year 2018, the year 2024, the year 2030, the year 2036, the year 2042, and the year 2048 and at that point would be just as old as our distinguished President pro tempore, Senator Strom Thurmond, is today. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss the issue of pre-vocational training in the context of this legislation. In March, I introduced S. 1709, the Job Preparation and Retention Training Act of 1998, which would have authorized a new Labor Department program providing grants to community-based organizations which would provide essential pre-vocational training to individuals who have not successfully entered the workforce. 
In my floor remarks on March 4 upon introduction of S. 1709, I noted that one such community-based organization, Opportunities Industrialization Centers of America, Inc., has found that the average hourly wage of trainees prior to pre-vocational training was $3.70, but after such training, these same participants started earning an average of $8.00 an hour, with a placement rate of 85 percent into gainful employment. 
After consultation with Chairman Jeffords, I have decided not to offer my bill as an amendment to the comprehensive job training bill before us, based on assurances that in Conference, he and Chairman DeWine will work with me to ensure that pre-vocational training is more accessible to individuals who are not prepared to fully benefit from the training and skills development provided in S. 1186.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after extensive study, discussions, and deliberation, I have decided to vote against ratifying the treaty to expand NATO. Since my college days, when I wrote my senior thesis on U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations, I have supported a strong U.S. role in international affairs. I oppose NATO expansion now because it does not fulfill NATO's basic purpose in countering the U.S.S.R. military threat that existed from 1945 to 1991 but, instead, creates a new potential threat from Russia. 
As a frequent participant in the North Atlantic Assembly meetings since the spring 1981 session in Venice, I have always felt that the United States consistently paid more than its fair share of the NATO burden. Our national interests were so substantial in countering the Soviet threat in Western Europe that it was worthwhile not to withdraw because other nations did not do their part in burden sharing. 
As noted in my votes and previous floor statements, I do not believe our vital national interests justify the extent of our contribution in Bosnia. In my judgment, that is a matter where European nations should have taken charge. It is always hard to say when century-old hostilities in the Balkans may threaten the peace, but the issue is sufficiently a European obligation that I do not think the United States should again be pulling the `laboring oar'--that is, doing more than our share. 
The inclusion in NATO of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary is the unmistakable start of bringing in more nations than the United States should be obligated to defend. It is getting us deeper into potential quicksand, like Bosnia. Perhaps even more important, including those countries poses more of a risk of a Russian military action against them than assurances of their national security. There is the obvious risk that Russia, with a deteriorating army, may choose to use its enormous nuclear arsenal. 
The representations that Russian President Boris Yeltsin does not object to NATO enlargement do not answer the threat that Russia might retaliate under a new leader. President Yeltsin's government is unstable. His health may be even worse. Radical Russian elements have already used NATO expansion as a potential argument to take over the Russian Presidency. Final action on expansion of NATO may give them the political weapon to succeed. So instead of strengthening NATO, the expansion may subject NATO to attack with the possible focus on its newest members. 
In 1949, the United States and its allies in Europe literally joined forces to define the post-World War II world. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established with a clear mission: collective defense of its members. NATO became the centerpiece of the U.S. policy of collective security and defined our military commitment to our allies in Europe. Throughout the Cold War, NATO protected U.S. interests and U.S. allies in Europe by providing a framework through which to overcome the political instabilities in post war Europe. NATO started out as a military alliance of 12 members and eventually expanded to a military alliance of 16 members. Turkey and Greece have been members since 1952, Germany since 1955, and Spain since 1982. 
Then, in 1989, the political landscape in Europe changed. The Berlin Wall fell. The Cold War was over. The Warsaw Pact disbanded. In 1990, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics disintegrated. In its stead, across central and eastern Europe and in Russia itself, fledgling governments began the transition to democracy and market-oriented economies. The original goal of NATO had been fulfilled. 
Immediately after the fall of communism, NATO began to reevaluate its role and purpose. NATO has redefined its organization to focus not only on collective defense, but also on `promoting stability throughout Europe through cooperation and by developing the means for collective crisis management and peacekeeping.' Furthermore, what started out as a military organization of first 12 then 16 nations is now holding out the possibility of membership for at least 12 new members and even more if the Administration's rhetoric comes to fruition. 
My former colleagues Senator Howard Baker and Senator Sam Nunn, along with former national security advisor Brent Scowcroft and Alton Frye from the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in February that the Administration's premise that NATO should be open to many additional members `is a prescription for destroying the alliance' which will antagonize Russia. In their words, NATO expansion is `an ill-defined invitation for new members unrelated to either military threats or military capabilities.' 
I agree with their interpretation that an expanded NATO is unrelated to current military threats and capabilities. I question U.S. participation in an organization increasingly devoted to `crisis management and peacekeeping.' While NATO was originally designed to counter the threat of communism, it will increasingly be called upon to counter new threats facing the region: particularly civil unrest and ethnic conflict in Eastern and Central Europe. Membership in NATO involves a serious commitment to defend other members if attacked. As NATO expands, the United States may well be obligating itself to become involved in a potentially great number of conflicts that are strictly European in nature and not a direct threat to vital U.S. national security interests. I do not believe the United States should commit to involvement in ethnic and civil hotspots throughout Europe, but should reserve the option to decide on such involvement on a case by case basis. 
Furthermore, NATO reports from the July 1997 NATO summit in Madrid state that the end of the Cold War has provided the opportunity to `build an improved security architecture in the whole of the Euro-Atlantic area without recreating dividing lines.' This line of reasoning is unsound. If NATO is in fact to remain a primarily military alliance, how can including new members not recreate dividing lines? It is likely that the new dividing lines will antagonize Russia. 
Last year, in an open letter to the President, 50 former Senators, cabinet secretaries and ambassadors, as well as arms control advisors and foreign policy experts, called for postponement of NATO expansion until other security options are explored. In their letter, they expressed concerns about drawing `a new line of division in Europe, between the `ins' and the `outs' of NATO,' which would actually work to increase regional instability and decrease the security of those not included. 
George Kennan, most noted for the policy of containment of Russian expansive tendencies, who later disclaimed the view that containment meant stationing military forces around Soviet borders, wrote in the New York Times last year that `expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era.' He went on to ask:  
Why, with all the hopeful possibilities engendered by the end of the cold war, should East-West relations become centered on the question of who would be allied with whom and, by implication, against whom in some fanciful, totally unforeseeable and most improbable future military conflict? 
Kennan pointed out that the Russians are not impressed with American assurances that NATO expansion does not reflect hostile intentions. In fact, he notes, the Russians `would continue to regard it as a rebuff by the West and would likely look elsewhere for guarantees of a secure future.' What comes to mind is forcing Russia to move even closer to China or Iran. 
Michael Brown, then senior fellow at the Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard, cautioned early on in 1994, when NATO was first addressing the question of new members, that `NATO expansion should be tied to strategic circumstances: If Russia takes steps to threaten Central Europe militarily, NATO should offer membership to as many states in the region as possible.' Otherwise, Brown pointed out, correctly I think, that `Russian aggression would be encouraged, not discouraged by NATO expansion.' 
Potential Russian presidential candidates are already preparing themselves for the next Russian presidential election in 2000 and NATO expansion is already on the platform. Alexander Lebed, a likely top contender for the Russian presidency, wrote in an opinion piece last year that NATO expansion is drawing Russia into `a process of mutual provocations.' He cautioned that `a reversion to old ways threatens the system of agreements which until recently had provided stability in Europe.' 
One year later, the Russians remain quite clear on how they view NATO expansion. Russia's ambassador to the United States, Yuli Vorontsov, commented in the March 10, 1998 Washington Post on what he calls the `authentic Russian view' of NATO expansion. 
In his article, Ambassador Vorontsov advises that `Russia's attitude toward NATO enlargement has been and remains unequivocally negative. The signing of the Russia-NATO Founding Act does not alter that attitude in any manner.' He goes on to say, `If enlargement goes forward, there are no guarantees that everything positive we have developed in the relationship between Russia and leading Western countries will not be put in severe jeopardy.' 
The most telling Russian reaction to date has been the Russian Duma's delayed vote on ratification of the START II treaty. Lebed contends that the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and other arms control treaties could all be reconsidered. 
In my college senior thesis, I was very much impressed by the famous words of Winston Churchill, which he gave in a 1939 London radio broadcast when he was first lord of the admiralty. Commenting on his inability to forecast the action of Russia, Churchill described Russia as `* * * a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.' But perhaps more telling is the oft-forgotten phrase following. Churchill went on to say that `* * * perhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interest.' NATO expansion is clearly not in the Russian national interest, and the West can expect Russia to react accordingly. 
I believe that the United States and Russia must maintain a real balance of power if we are going to coexist as peaceful nations. Clearly, if NATO is to remain a strictly military alliance, expanding NATO to the east means tilting the balance of power toward the west. If the desire is to create greater economic and political cooperation among Western and Central European nations, there are already existing organizations such as the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and others to take up this task. 
Many claim that there is now a security vacuum in Central Europe that NATO expansion can address. On the contrary, I believe NATO expansion is creating just such a vacuum. It is implausible to think that Russia would send conventional troops into Central Europe any time soon. 
While it is probable that there are lingering fears of Russian aggression in the countries of Central Europe, Russia's current Army capabilities make such an advance next to impossible. Furthermore, the West would never tolerate a repeat of past Russian aggression in these countries. 
On the other hand, it is plausible to think that Russia will revisit the status of its relations with the Baltic nations, Ukraine and Belarus. Oddly enough, these may be the countries most likely to be adversely affected by NATO expansion and the very nations not to be included in the first round of new members. We must also not forget Russian military involvement in Georgia and in the Armenia-Azerbaidjan conflict. How will NATO expansion influence Russian military action in the Caucasus? 
In 1992, I presented remarks at the North Atlantic Assembly meeting in the Netherlands while I was part of a Senate delegation visiting the Assembly, commenting then that there was an unease among the American people over the cost of U.S. foreign relations obligations. That is not to say that the predominant U.S. view would ever return to the isolationist ideology of the 1930s, but the question I posed then was: What is fair and equitable? As a longtime member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I believe many Americans still feel the same unease when it comes to U.S. contributions to areas clearly outside our vital national interests. 
Again in 1993, after returning from the next North Atlantic Assembly meeting, in remarks on the Senate floor, I commented on the debate under way in NATO at the time on inviting new members to join the alliance. There were signs at the time that NATO and the North Atlantic Assembly were looking more toward economic matters than defense matters. Furthermore, when we talked to the Director of the Center for Strategic Stability, he made the point that the Russians were very concerned about an expanding alliance. The concern then was what would happen with respect to Russia being isolated. I do not believe this question has been adequately addressed. 
Last January, I made remarks on the Senate floor concerning my participation in the 1996 North Atlantic Assembly meeting. I noted that NATO has been perhaps the most successful international collective security arrangement in the world's history, ultimately achieving its once thought unattainable goal of containing and outlasting the empire of the former Soviet Union through a vigilant deterrence rather than actual conflict. It was this successful because it was more than a mutual defense pact. It is the coming together, across the Atlantic, of the power of the ideas of freedom and democracy. However, I pointed out that NATO's very success in achieving its original aim is the 
basis of the present quandary of the alliance. I asked then, and I repeat now: In the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union there are many reasons--including our responsibility to wisely spend American taxpayers' dollars--why we must ask what is NATO for now, what countries should be a part of the Alliance, and what roles and burdens should be played and borne by the different members of the North Atlantic community? 
In the year since I gave these remarks, there has been much discussion and debate on NATO expansion, here in the Senate and in the media. I believe the situation now in Bosnia gives us reason to pause and reflect on these questions before we commit the United States to even more security obligations in Eastern and Central Europe. 
During my visit last December to Bosnia, I asked our troops to estimate how long we would need to stay there to avoid the resumption of bloodshed which would happen if they left on Congress' schedule. The answer was a `generation,' given the intensity and longevity of the religious and ethnic tensions in the region. There is no doubt about the dire consequences if fighting resumes among the Muslims, Serbs and Croats. The entire region would be destabilized. Certainly, the current situation in Kosovo is cause for great alarm. Russia has come out on the side of the Serbs against the United States and Europe. In the short term, the ability of the West to work with Russia will aid in the resolution of this issue. This picture changes in the long-term. Albania, Kosovo's neighbor to the south, is on the long list of countries proposed for NATO membership. 
There is significant question as to how far can U.S. military resources be stretched on the current $268 billion defense budget. The top military brass in Bosnia had no answer to my question on priorities in deciding how to spend among Bosnia, Korea, Iran, Iraq and the world's other hot spots. 
Now we add to this the additional costs of NATO expansion. Although the Administration says the total cost of expansion will be $27 to $35 billion--the U.S. portion being $1.5-$2 billion over 10 years--other estimates for the cost of NATO expansion range as high as $125 billion. There are many unanswered questions about the cost of NATO expansion. 
We have good reason to conclude that the estimates of the administration as usual, are deceptively low. 
If we use Bosnia as an example, how much more are we willing to spend in Europe than the Europeans themselves? Doing our part does not mean doing more than other major European nations. This is not the Cold War where the United States squared off against the USSR and our dominant role in NATO protected our vital national interests. Obviously, Bosnian stability is of much greater concern to the European nations than it is to the U.S. although you wouldn't know it from the contributions in Bosnia today. This also does not mean that the United States cannot play an important strategic role in the region, for the United States has played a successful leading role in the War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. 
The United States will always play a role in peace and security in Europe. We all applaud the great success of the new countries of Eastern and Central Europe on their transition to democracy and free-market economies. However, as we move into the 21st century, I believe this is not the time for NATO expansion. 
We would be moving away from the basic premise that NATO was expanded to protect Western Europe from Soviet attack. We would be looking at a Russia now, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, which is not stable. We are trying to build up our relationships with Russia. Certainly this would be very counterproductive. 
As I noted earlier, I recall very well in my studies at the University of Pennsylvania noting in my college thesis on United States-U.S.S.R. relations the description of Winston Churchill that Russian foreign policy was a mystery surrounded by a puzzle wrapped in an enigma. It is puzzling as to what the Russian will do next. They are enigmatic. 
While we are on the path which has a reasonable possibility of leading to peace and stability, the inclusion of new NATO members I do believe would be counterproductive. 
For these reasons, I oppose the expansion of NATO at this time. 
I intend to vote against the ratification of this treaty. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on February 24, 1998, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing on the nomination of Acting Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs Togo D. West, Jr. be the permanent Secretary of that agency. The committee carefully evaluated the nominee and his statements before the committee. It reviewed Mr. West's submissions of his background and financial interests and the investigation completed on all Presidential nominations and conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As a result, the committee voted unanimously on April 21 to report favorably to the full Senate the nomination of Togo D. West, Jr. to be the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs has been without a permanent Secretary since Jesse Brown resigned in July 1997. This is too long a period for any department of the Federal government to be without its senior leader and manager. It is especially true for the Department of Veterans Affairs which is in a period of major transition of its health program from inpatient to outpatient care in a period of a declining real budget. In addition, the Department's administration of its benefits programs has been seriously challenged and is in need of major restructuring and effective leadership. Also, the Department, like other federal departments and agencies, faces a major hurdle in adjusting its computer-based information systems to the Year 2000. 
It appears to me that Togo D. West, Jr. has the prerequisite qualifications to meet these challenges, to lead the Department, and to provide the health and benefits services which our veterans have come to expect and deserve. 
Mr. West has been serving as Acting Secretary since January 2, 1998, pursuant to a December 2, 1997, Presidential directive under authority of the so-called `Vacancies Act,' 5 U.S.C. 3348. He concurrently has been serving as Secretary of the Army, a position he has held since November 1993. He relinquishes that position upon being sworn in as Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Mr. West's background is extensive and impressive. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Field Artillery Corps upon graduation from college and following law school, he was called to active duty in the Army's Judge Advocate General Corps. In 1975, he served in the Department of Justice as an Associate Deputy Attorney General and in 1977 he was named General Counsel for the Navy. In 1979, he served as the Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense and Deputy Secretary, and in January 1980 was appointed General Counsel of the Department of Defense. 
Mr. West is an articulate and dedicated public servant. I believe that he will serve well the Department and our country's veterans. Therefore, I thank my colleagues for their support of this nomination.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I seek to submit a resolution recognizing the Valley Forge Military Academy and College for establishing the `General H. Norman Schwarzkopf Library.' 
The Valley Forge Military Academy and College, located near Historic Valley Forge National Park and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is the ideal site to commemorate General H. Norman Schwarzkopf and his many accomplishments. The Academy broke ground in March, 1998 to begin construction of a Regimental Mess Hall, a section of which will serve as a Library to honor those Americans who participated in the Desert Shield and Desert Storm campaigns. The Library, which would serve both the Academy and the community, will contain some of the General's personal papers, memorabilia, and artifacts commemorating Desert Storm and Desert Shield. It would be appropriate and beneficial for young collegians to have access to history they have witnessed. In 1989, General Schwarzkopf is quoted as having said, `West Point prepared me for the Army, but Valley Forge prepared me for life.' 
General Schwarzkopf graduated from the Valley Forge Military Academy as Valedictorian in 1952, thereafter he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point. During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, General Schwarzkopf served as the Commander in Chief of the United States Central Command. From his days as an accomplished cadet, General Schwarzkopf has proven himself to be a superior and compassionate commander. 
General Schwarzkopf has served the United States with distinction for more than 35 years. Throughout his military career, the General has earned numerous distinguished service awards including commendations for valor, two purple hearts, honoring decorations, as well as the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
For these reasons, I take great pride in sponsoring this resolution to recognize the Valley Forge Military Academy and College for establishing the `General H. Norman Schwarzkopf Library,' which will serve as a national commemorative site for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call amendment No. 2254. 
Mr. President, before the amendment is read, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to modify the amendment. What I intend to do here is to change the source of the funding for an additional $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health. Instead of taking it from the tobacco reserve fund--instead, to have an across-the-board cut of four-tenths of 1 percent. That is the modification which I seek to make.

Mr. SPECTER. I compliment the managers of the bill, especially my distinguished colleague Senator Domenici, for his very prodigious work on this budget and the budgets in the years that I have been here, going back to 1981. 
I offer an amendment to what Senator Domenici has done with some trepidation, but I do so because I think it is a very important matter, and I offer this amendment really in my capacity as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee which has jurisdiction over the funding for Health and Human Services and for the National Institutes of Health. 
As I read the budget resolution with my expert staff, there is not funding for the subcommittee to be able to add funds for the National Institutes of Health. The distinguished chairman and I have had some disagreement on the import of the budget resolution, but as I read it, with my experts on the staff, there is only $350 million for outlays, which would not accommodate the kind of increase which this Senate is on record as being committed to. 
Last year, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution was adopted to double NIH funding over the next 5 years, and that has been a rallying cry and one with which I agree. Were that standard to be met, it would mean more than $2.5 billion a year. 
Notwithstanding that amendment having been adopted for fiscal year 1998, the year we are in, when the Budget Committee returned last year's budget, the health account was cut by $100 million. Therefore, Senator Harkin, my distinguished ranking member on the subcommittee, and I had set a target of a 7.5 percent increase for NIH, which is a good bit below the doubling over 5 years. We thought that was all we could afford. 
We then offered an amendment, similar to the one now being offered, for an across-the-board cut to enable us to increase NIH funding by $1.1 billion. That amendment was defeated 63 to 37, so that when it came to expressing our druthers, or our preferences, we were very generous as a Senate body, and said we would double NIH funding over 5 years, or more than $2.5 billion a year. But when it came time to specify where the money was going to come from and have a hard dollar amount, that was defeated, as I say, 63 to 37. We are very generous with our druthers, but we are not very generous with our dollars. 
We had a hearing, coincidentally, just yesterday in our regular quarter for the experts at the National Institutes of Health to come in and testify about the grants which are made, about 28 percent of those which are offered, and there would be a very, very substantial additional number of grants awarded if the additional funds were there. 
We have a total budget of $1.7 trillion. I believe that it is a matter of assessing our priorities. It is my submission in this amendment, with my distinguished ranking member, Senator Harkin, that we ought to up the ante by at least $2 billion. I know that when it comes across the board, it is goring a lot of oxen, and there will be many who will object because it comes out of their funds. If we are going to articulate our priority for NIH, then we ought to put our money where our mouths are and put up the money to actually fund it. 
I changed the thrust of the amendment, as noted, to move away from the tobacco reserve fund, because that is a giant pot we are talking about on the tobacco settlement, but I think it is pie in the sky. It is questionable, speculative, and perhaps doubtful that those funds will be realized. 
In making the plans for our subcommittee, I want to know where we stand. That is why we are talking about hard dollars in this amendment. It is not too hard to say, `Well, we'll get it from the tobacco reserve fund, because it really is highly speculative as to whether it will ever exist.' 
I believe that with the identification of many of the genes by the National Institutes of Health, we are on the brink of conquering cancer, on the brink of conquering Alzheimer's, on the brink of conquering Parkinson's, on the brink of conquering heart disease, on the brink of conquering AIDS, on the brink of conquering many of the maladies which afflict mankind, but it takes dollars. 
When you allow 28 percent of the grants, that means 72 percent of the doors are closed; 72 percent which are not allowed. If we open those doors, I think we will be enormously productive in seeing to it that we make the maximum effort to pursue breast cancer and prostate cancer and cervical cancer and Alzheimer's and a long list of maladies which confront us at the present time. 
That is the essence of the amendment, Mr. President. I know my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, wishes some time, so 
let me inquire at this point how much time is left on the 15 minutes of allocation.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will have printed in the Record a `Dear Colleague' letter on the amendment which I had intended to offer, as I described earlier, opening the tobacco reserve to permit it to be used for biomedical research. This letter was circulated on March 31, 1998, cosigned by Senator Harkin, Senator Boxer, Senator Hollings, and myself. We had a list of some 18 cosponsors to Senate Resolution 170, which was a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which I had submitted earlier in the session. 
It had been my intention to have a freestanding sense-of-the-Senate resolution to increase NIH funding by $2 billion. I had made an effort, with the cooperation of our distinguished majority leader, to have that listed as a freestanding resolution which I had hoped to bring to a vote before the budget resolution came up. We had anticipated voting on it on Monday or Tuesday, but it was not cleared. So we did not have an opportunity to bring up that resolution. 
The point of the resolution was to see how many people would say, as a matter of druthers or sense of the Senate, that they would support it, and contrast it to the number of people who would support the hard-dollar transfer. I do not know--the budget resolution moves so fast--how many more of the 18 who are cosponsors of Senate Resolution 170, which is sense of the Senate, will join here. These four Senators on this letter support increasing biomedical research by $2 billion.

Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague and friend, Senator Domenici, for his comments. He has enumerated programs which will be cut. It is a matter of priorities. 
When he has recited there is an assumption of $1.5 billion for the National Institutes of Health, I have to disagree, because the Budget Committee assumes only an outlay increase of $350 million over the level from fiscal year 1998. There are also increases in education and child care programs. So there could not possibly be an increase at NIH with an increase of only $350 million in outlays. 
As Senator Domenici has recited a number of cuts, let me just recite a partial list of the people who come to me as chairman of this subcommittee, who want increases in funding for breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, diabetes--including juvenile diabetes--kidney ailments, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's, schizophrenia, scleroderma, epilepsy, heart disease, prostate cancer, pulmonary disorders, AIDS, osteoporosis, Huntington's disease, to mention only a few. 
The fact is that many Senators receive awards from Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or AIDS, et cetera. This is a matter of priority, pure and simple. 
Senator Domenici is a valued member of the committee. He and I sit next to each other on the Appropriations Committee, have for years, and he comes and talks about mental illness programs. We have accommodated that as a very high priority. That is what the Senator has to do, establish the priorities. I say that it is worth the four-tenths of 1 percent cut across the board for this high priority for the National Institutes of Health. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe that veterans are entitled to be compensated for illnesses related to smoking because that has been the determination of the General Counsel of the Veterans Administration and the doctors who have analyzed this program. The Veterans' Affairs Committee had an extensive hearing on this matter a few days ago. The reallocation of $10.5 billion to another expenditure line, I believe, is unfair to the veterans of America. Young people are taken away from homes. They are put in situations of stress. Cigarettes are provided either free or at a low cost. The determination has been made by the General Counsel that nicotine dependence is a disease and it is compensable. If the money is not to go for tobacco-related illnesses, it ought to remain in the VA funds generally, because the VA funds are very, very limited for the tremendous obligation owed to the veterans of America. 
I believe another source of funding might be available from the tobacco funding. And as much as I want to see the highway program proceed, and highways are very necessary as a matter of infrastructure for America, I believe the veterans' benefits come first. I do not believe we need any additional studies on this matter. The analysis has been made extensively by the general counsel that it is a disease, that nicotine addiction is a disease, and the veterans are entitled to be compensated. These funds ought to be made available to the veterans, as Senator Rockefeller has proposed. 
How much time do I have, Mr. President?

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment in the second degree because an additional study is not necessary. The matter has already been studied extensively by the Veterans Administration. There has been an opinion of the General Counsel that nicotine is a disease and that it is compensable. A study might be all right if we did not take $10.5 billion off what ought to be in the Veterans' Affairs account--the Department of Veterans' Affairs account--and put it somewhere else. 
I believe the underlying amendment by the Senator from West 
Virginia is accurate. The second-degree amendment ought to be defeated. 
I will yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment would provide for $2 billion extra for NIH to offset by four-tenths of 1 percent a cut in all programs. This body has expressed a sense of the Senate that we should double NIH over 5 years, which will call for $2.5 billion a year. This is a lesser amount. We have expectations built up by the sense-of-the-Senate expression of our druthers. Now is the time to put our dollars behind it. Although there is paperwork to the contrary, Mr. President, although the budget does not determine how it is going to go, which is through the appropriations process, we will have only $350 million in additional outlays for an $80 billion budget by the subcommittee. We need this $2 billion if we are to move ahead on the important NIH functions.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to explain my vote against the Coverdell Amendment, which has a laudable objective of reducing the federal tax burden on millions of American families, but goes about funding such tax relief in a manner which I cannot support. 
Specifically, the Coverdell Amendment provides for $101.5 billion/five years in tax relief through making more Americans eligible for the 15 percent tax bracket. The revenues lost through this amendment would be made up by cuts in all non-defense discretionary spending programs and over the same five-year period. 
As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I know how hard it is to reduce federal spending. I have used a scalpel, not a meat axe, to cut 134 federal programs over the last five years, with savings totaling $1.5 billion. The cuts proposed in the Coverdell Amendment for FY99 include $1.5 billion from health programs such as the National Institutes of Health and $2.5 billion from education, job training, employment, and social services. Other cuts in the Coverdell Amendment trouble me, such as $737 million in transportation and over $1 billion in cuts for veterans' programs in FY99. 
With respect to the tax relief offered by the Coverdell Amendment, I do not believe it actually goes far enough toward flattening the current tax brackets. My own approach toward reducing the tax burden on Americans is my Flat Tax Act (S. 593). I am troubled that Americans spend 5.4 billion hours and $600 billion each year complying with the complexities of the 12,000 pages of the Internal Revenue Code rules and regulations. I believe that the best answer for alleviating the tremendous tax burden on America's working families and businesses is a flat tax, and have proposed replacing the current tax code with a 20 percent flat tax on individuals and businesses that could be filed on a simple 10-line postcard.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, for the Barzilay, Morgenstern and Specter families, it is a great honor for Judith M. Barzilay to become a judge on the U.S. International Court of Trade. She was nominated by the President on January 27 and confirmed by the Senate March 11, 1998. 
For her immigrant grandparents, Harry and Lillie Specter and Max and Regina Morgenstern, it is an accomplishment beyond their aspirations even though they knew they came to a land of great opportunity. 
In May of 1947, Max and Regina left the bar and grill which they operated on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn to visit their son, Arthur, his wife Hilda, her parents in Russell, KS, and, most of all to see their granddaughters, Judith, age 3, and Julia, 3 months old. By then, Judy pretty much presided over her parents' household just as she had over the household of her Specter grandparents after she was born on January 3, 1944. 
Judith was the New Year's baby of Russell for 1944. In New York City, the first born in the New Year probably arrived at 12:01 a.m., but it took 3 days for Russell's first arrival in 1944. She came with a retinue of presents from the town's merchants and to our five-room bungalow at 115 Elm Street. 
My sister, Hilda, her mother, was a brilliant graduate from the University of Wichita in 1942, had won a scholarship to Syracuse University to pursue a masters degree in governmental administration. She had met, Arthur Morgensten, a handsome lieutenant stationed at Fort Riley, when he came to Wichita in the fall of 1941 to attend Yom Kippur services. They fell in love. So when he was about to ship overseas to the South Pacific in April 1943, Hilda took the transcontinental train ride to San Francisco where they were married. It was not the typical wartime romance with a weekend honeymoon, because the marriage has lasted 1 day shy of 55 years and is still going strong. 
When Hilda came home to Russell, KS, to await Judith's arrival, our family was overjoyed, including me, her little brother, although I took up residence in the scorpion-infested basement and gave up high school basketball to take over Hilda's bookkeeping job at O.K. Rubber Welders I might add--at 50 cents an hour. 
For me, Judy was more like a sister than a niece during that time. For my parents, Judy was the apple of their eyes. When our sister, Shirley, took off a year from Oklahoma College for Women to teach country school, my father would leave his junkyard to drive Shirley to school with his virtual constant companion, Judith, sitting beside him in the truck without the modern safeguards of seat belts. 
My brother, Morton, returned to Russell to join my father and Arthur in a partnership which moved from junk, that is scrap metal, to used oil field equipment to stripper wells. The Morgenstern children, Judy and Julia, joined by twins Jonathan and Johanna in 1952, were the centerpieces of our close-knit family. 
When the children grew older and their parents wanted a Jewish education for them, the Morgensterns moved to Wichita where Hilda took on the job of superintendent of the Hebrew School. Wichita was inadequate so they moved to Denver. Denver was inadequate so they moved to New York City. New York City was inadequate, so they moved to Jerusalem where Hilda and Arthur live to this day. 
Meanwhile Judy was a serious and accomplished student receiving a B.A. degree from Wichita State University and M.L.S. and J.D. from Rutgers University. After graduation from law school, she was a staff attorney with the International Trade Office of the U.S. Department of Justice from 1983 through 1986. She then practiced law with the prestigious firm of Siegel, Mandell & Davidson in New York City for 2 1/2 years before joining Sony Electronics, Inc., where she worked from October 1988 to the present attaining the position of vice president of government affairs. 
With 16 years of experience as a manager, litigator, and business adviser, she was appointed by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in 1995 to the Treasury Advisory Committee on Commercial Operations of the U.S. Customs Service. She has lectured on international trade law and its application to business. With this extraordinary background, she is preeminently well qualified for the U.S. International Court of Trade. 
While it is customary to make a floor speech on confirmation of a nominee, I have taken a little more time of the Senate and the cost of printing in the Congressional Record because I believe it is worthwhile to note the accomplishments and contributions of families of America's immigrants. We debate the immigration issue in Congress in a variety of contexts, so it is important to chronolog how our country has been enriched by the immigrants' families as evidenced by the new judge for the U.S. International Court of Trade: the Honorable Judith M. Barzilay.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment briefly upon the amendment which was argued a little earlier in the day. I had been on the floor when the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, was offered. There were many Senators here, and I had other commitments. I am going to support Senator Nickles' amendment, although I do so with some substantial concern for the funding 
at HCFA. 
When the additional personnel had been requested to move forward on the provisions of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, it seems to me that Senator Nickles had made a valid argument that most of the States, almost all of the States, have applied and it is not in an emergency classification. I am further concerned that this funding has been requested by the Department of Health and Human Services on an emergency appropriations bill which does not quite fit the mold. Where we have these emergency appropriations bills, it is my view that we really ought to limit them to matters that are truly emergencies and not seek to pile on and use this as an occasion for appropriations which really can wait their turn. 
I speak on this amendment in my capacity as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee which has jurisdiction over the Department of Health and Human Services. We conduct, through my subcommittee, considerable oversight on HCFA. I am very much concerned that they should be adequately funded to carry out their duties. 
Last week, we had a hearing with HCFA on the issue of the changes in compensation for a variety of physician categories, and at the same time we also had a hearing for the appropriation for fiscal year 1999 where the Secretary of Health and Human Services testified and the Administrator of HCFA, Min DeParle, testified as well, 
and did not raise the issue of this appropriation in this emergency appropriations bill. So I do think that had it been a matter of great urgency, in my capacity as chairman of that subcommittee, it would have been called to my attention, it would have been impressed on me, which was not the case. 
In reviewing this matter with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I do concur with his analysis that it is not an appropriate matter for an emergency appropriation. And if it is the enforcement of Kassebaum-Kennedy, there are personnel available to do that, and that is not at a critical stage. 
I had heard that the appropriation was sought to carry forward the change in the schedule on physicians' compensation, but apparently that does not seem to be the case. So, as I say, I am ready, willing, and able to take a look at what HCFA needs. We are now in the process of considering the appropriations bill for next year, and I think an orderly process makes it preferable that we consider this appropriation request at that time. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have today introduced, at the request of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, S. 1822, a proposed bill to authorize the provision of medical care to veterans who were treated with nasopharyngeal radium irradiation. The Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs submitted this proposed legislation to the President of the Senate by letter dated August 11, 1997. 
Mr. President, it is my usual practice, as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, to introduce Administration-requested legislation that is referred to the Committee without commenting on the substance of the introduced bills, without committing myself to either support or oppose the legislation in question, and without seeking co-sponsors. In this case, I have departed from my usual practice due to the unusual nature of this legislation, which is long overdue. I am pleased that Senator Jay Rockefeller, the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, has joined me as a cosponsor. 
A medical treatment known as nasopharyngeal radium irradiation --the inserting of a radium-tipped metal rod through the nose--began in 1924 at the Johns Hopkins University as a means to treat middle ear obstructions and deafness. It was also commonly used to treat children with chronic ear infections. Even until the mid 1960's, medical textbooks recommended this treatment to shrink adenoid tissue in children. It is estimated that from 500,000 to 2 million persons may have received nasopharyngeal radium irradiation treatments over the years. 
During the 1940's and 1950's--and perhaps later--the military treated submariners and air crew members with nasopharyngeal radium irradiation to prevent ear injury caused by severe pressure changes encountered in submarine and flight duty. The Final Report of the Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments issued in 1995 cites one case where the Navy in the early 1940's treated 732 submariners with nasopharyngeal radium irradiation to equalize middle ear pressure with a 90 percent success rate. 
Unfortunately, scientific research now suggests that individuals who received this then-accepted medical treatment may be at increased risk for developing head and neck cancers and other types of diseases and disorders. When nasopharyngeal irradiation was administered, radiation targeted to lymph tissue also affected the brain and other tissues in the head and neck, including the paranasal sinuses, salivary glands, thyroid and parathyroid glands. 
Mr. President, the Committee on Veterans Affairs will fully develop the scientific record on this legislation. I will not now, therefore, discuss at length the evidence to support the proposition that veterans who received such therapy should now be eligible for VA care to treat the previously unknown medical consequences of nasopharyngeal radium irradiation. Suffice it to say now that the quantum of radiation to which people were routinely exposed as a consequence of nasopharyngeal radium irradiation far exceeded levels that would be judged acceptable today. Our colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, stated it well when he commented in August 1994, at a hearing of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Radiation: `. . . the best evidence of the danger of this radium treatment is the fact that no doctor in his right mind would think of performing such a procedure today.' 
VA has proposed that veterans who received such treatment in the past be deemed eligible for treatment of cancers and other diseases and disorders that might be associated with this well-intentioned, but seemingly misguided, exposure to radiation. This legislation, if enacted, would authorize VA to treat such veterans on the same priority basis as it treats veterans who may have been exposed to ionizing radiation during weapons testing or during the occupation of Japan following World War II. It would also authorize VA to examine any veteran who was subjected to nasopharyngeal irradiation and include any findings in the VA's radiation registry. 
As Chairman of the Veteran's Affairs Committee, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting this legislation.

Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment on the nomination of Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and that nomination having been withdrawn this afternoon at the request of Judge Massiah-Jackson. I appreciate and understand the reasons leading to her withdrawal. 
I commend Judge Massiah-Jackson for her tenacity and courage and for completing the record on all the new questions which were unexpectedly raised at last week's hearing, on Wednesday, March 11. At the outset, I want to thank our distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, for his courtesies on this matter and to thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Santorum, for his strenuous efforts in seeking the second hearing for Judge Massiah-Jackson in an effort to try to do the fair thing with Judge Massiah-Jackson. 
I think it is important to future nominations to face up to exactly what happened in this matter to prevent a recurrence and to improve the system for the future. In my judgment, Judge Massiah-Jackson was unfairly treated by her opponents, and in my judgment, Judge Massiah-Jackson was unfairly treated by the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
I believe it is important to find out about nominees who are submitted for the Federal bench because that is a very, very important appointment having lifetime tenure. I believe the law is the highest calling and that the courts have been established to adjudicate disputes between the government and the government's citizens and between people and among parties. I have spent my entire adult life as a lawyer, and I consider it a high calling. There are many of those attributes which are important in the course of working as a U.S. Senator, especially on the Judiciary Committee. 
In my judgment, Judge Massiah-Jackson's opponents dealt with her unfairly at the outset by seeking to kill her nomination anonymously. If anyone had anything to say about Judge Massiah-Jackson, I believe they should have come forward and should have come forward at an early date. She was nominated for the judgeship on July 31, but it was not until almost 6 months later that her opponents came forward, after there had been two hearings and after the Senate Judiciary Committee had approved her nomination by a vote of 12-6. 
When those anonymous complaints were filed--which led some people to say that she was soft on crime, and I thought without any basis to do so from those anonymous complaints--Senator Santorum and Senator Biden and I held an unusual field hearing in Philadelphia on October 3, and we invited people to come forward. We specifically invited some who later turned out to be among her most vocal critics. But no one came forward at that time. Instead, we had a group of judges who had served with her--I believe five in number--who said she was well within the mainstream. We had representatives of the distinguished mayor of Philadelphia, Edward Rendell, himself a former district attorney. Mayor Rendell said publicly and expressed to me privately, `Stick with the public record; Judge Massiah-Jackson was an excellent nominee for the district court.' Mayor Rendell said she had been appealed very little with respect to sentencing, that she had a very, very good record. While Mayor Rendell could not be present at the October 3 hearing, his representative was, as were others. 
Then the Judiciary Committee held a hearing in late October, and in early November voted Judge Massiah-Jackson out by a vote of 12-6. It was not until later--I believe in early January--that opponents began to surface. Some of those opponents had previously said directly to Judge Massiah-Jackson that her nomination was applauded, that the celebration on swearing-in was an event to be looked forward to. When these opponents came forward, Senator Santorum and I said that we ought to have a full inquiry into what the objections were. Toward that end, on January 23, we met with district attorneys in my office in Philadelphia and heard complaints of a very generalized nature; very few cases were mentioned, with the district attorneys saying that they would file their objections within a week so that we would know what was on the record and we could make a determination as to what to do, because a vote had been scheduled for Judge Massiah-Jackson for January 28. 
The vote was put off to give the district attorneys an opportunity to present their objections. They filed them on February 2, which was a Monday, a little late, but OK. Then Judge Massiah-Jackson went to work to respond to quite a number of cases which the district attorneys had raised. It seemed to me that, notwithstanding the fact that the district attorneys were very late in presenting their objections, they ought to be heard, there ought not to be a time limit. If they had not come forward early, let them come forward later and let us find out what their objections were, let us give Judge Massiah-Jackson an opportunity to respond, 
and then let the Senate make a judgment. 
Then the hearing for Judge Massiah-Jackson was set for last Wednesday, March 11. By this time, the district attorneys had created a considerable crescendo of public opposition. They had done that on a selective citation of cases, illustrative of which was a case involving undercover officers who, Judge Massiah-Jackson's critics said, had been exposed in open court. But when that matter was pursued, it was determined that those officers had testified in open court and their identities had been disclosed. So there was hardly anything to be disclosed since it had already occurred in open court. 
Another case which was widely publicized was a case where Judge Massiah-Jackson had deferred the imposition of sentence on a case involving a defendant motorist who had struck a pedestrian. When those facts were looked into in some detail, it was determined that the victim had asked for the postponement in order that the defendant could make restitution, that, in fact, the defendant had made restitution. That case was appealed to the Pennsylvania higher courts as to the adequacy of Judge Massiah-Jackson's opinions, and the appellate court said Judge Massiah-Jackson had acted properly. 
In the totality of cases, Judge Massiah-Jackson handled some 4,000 cases between 1984 when she was appointed to the bench and 1991 when she stopped sitting on criminal cases. There were only four appeals taken from her sentences. In one of those appeals she was reversed because she had given too long a sentence. The guidelines had been exceeded, so said the appellate court. She was too tough. She imposed too long a sentence. In the other three cases, she was reversed twice and upheld once. But three appeals by the Commonwealth involving many, many sentences coming out of some 4,000 cases which had been heard--not all resulted in sentences because some were acquittals--is not too bad a record, to say it very, very plainly. 
When the district attorneys had submitted, I believe it was 39 cases on February 2, not 50 which they said they would submit, in an analysis of the representations by the district attorneys to what the transcripts showed, there was a wide variance. The district attorneys had taken the facts as they represented them in the light according to the Commonwealth's witnesses but did not take into account witnesses for the defense or the issues of credibility or the other matters in which a judge might make a different finding. In the hearing on March 11, I put a number of those matters into the Record. 
The hearing of March 11 was really a very extraordinary one, in my opinion. By the time these selective cases had been disseminated to law enforcement agencies, quite understandably, quite a number of law enforcement agencies came forward to object to Judge Massiah-Jackson. That is not surprising because they did not know the entire record. 
It ought to be pointed out that this confirmation process for Judge Massiah-Jackson has come on the heels of a very unusual case captioned Commonwealth v. Lambert, a murder case out of Lancaster County, PA, where a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania--the same court to which Judge Massiah-Jackson had been nominated--where a Federal district court judge in Philadelphia had found constitutional error, which is not surprising, but it was surprising that the judge had ordered that there be no retrial in that case involving a conviction for murder. That was an extraordinary ruling, and in my legal research, unprecedented. I joined with Congressman Pitts and others in introducing legislation to clarify that jurisdiction of a district court judge. The finding of constitutional error is well within the purview of the court, the suppression of that evidence is well within the purview of the court, but it is not within the purview of the court to say that the case could not be retried. That is a matter for the State court in Lancaster County and for the Lancaster County district attorney. The district attorneys who had opposed Judge Massiah-Jackson were very explicit in saying that 
they were not going to see another judge sent to the district court like the one who had ravaged, they said practically ruined, the district attorney of Lancaster County. 
So against that recent backdrop, it was not surprising that when law enforcement agencies saw a limited part of the record without knowing all of the facts, that they would be opposed to Judge Massiah-Jackson. 
It is not irrelevant to point out that I was district attorney in Philadelphia for 8 years, from 1966 to 1974, and before that an assistant district attorney for 4 years and, obviously, have had considerable experience in the criminal courts of Philadelphia. The decisions which Judge Massiah-Jackson made were well within the keeping of the Philadelphia criminal courts. I take second place to no one in battling with the judges on the issues of sentencing. When I was district attorney of Philadelphia, I made it a practice to petition for reconsideration of a sentence when I thought the sentence was inadequate. I went right before the court, and on one occasion was so tenacious that I was held in contempt of court when I protested a lenient sentence imposed on someone convicted of selling drugs, 6 ounces of pure, uncut heroin. I was so insistent on battling the judges on the issue of sentencing that procedure was taken away from the district attorneys by a superior court opinion, saying it was double jeopardy and the courts of Pennsylvania had noted my opposition to sentencing. So that was gone. 
I also took a common law appeal to try to appeal sentences when I was district attorney from 1966 to 1974. The D.A. did not have a right of appeal, and I drafted legislation to give the district attorney the right of appeal, and ultimately that statute came into existence. But when I was district attorney, I found three very egregious cases and decided to take an appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to argue a common law right of appeal. 
One of the cases, as I recollect, was a motorist who had been convicted of drunken driving and was driving on a revoked license and killed two people and had gotten probation. I thought that was horrendous and thought there ought to be a right of appeal. Another case involved, as I recollect it, the deputy commissioner of licensing inspections, convicted of 40 counts of corrupt practices, and got probation. Another case which I considered an outlandish sentence and thought there ought to be a right of the district attorney to appeal involved a defendant named Arnold Marks. I have referred to the 6 ounces of pure, uncut heroin worth $280,000, as I recollect it, and 6 1/2 months in jail. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania disagreed with me, fairly unceremoniously, and said I did not have a right of appeal and dismissed my effort. As I say, the district attorney's right to file an appeal was later upheld by statute, so if anybody today disagrees with the judge's sentence or anybody disagreed with Judge Massiah-Jackson's sentences, they could take it to appeal. As I say, it only happened three times by the district attorney's office in the handling of some 4,000 cases. 
There were occasions when I challenged the judges on the findings of the fact. In those days the Commonwealth district attorney had a right to demand a jury trial. We did not have a right of appeal, but we did have a right to demand a jury trial as party to the proceedings. And it was with some frequency that I exercised that right to demand a jury trial--so often that the supreme court changed the rule, and said the district attorney no longer had the right to demand a jury trial. 
So I take second place to no one, Madam President, in terms of battling on findings of fact in criminal cases and battling on the issue of sentencing. And I take second place to no one since coming to the Senate, having been elected in 1980, and having authored the armed career criminal bill. This is a very strong statute dealing with 15-years-to-life sentences for career criminals who have three major convictions--not larceny of cookies, I might add, but robbery or burglary or sale of major drugs, and later found in possession of a firearm--to get a life sentence; 15 years to life--15 years is the equivalent of a life sentence in the Federal prisons. 
There is legislation which I worked on for the better part of a decade, which abbreviates the amount of time there can be on appeal in the Federal courts from a State conviction with the death penalty from about 15 years, which the cases have taken 2 1/2 years; I have also been in the lead on getting adequate funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a variety of State action and as well as for Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. 
The March 11 hearing, Madam President, I thought was atrocious, to use a fairly mild word, because Judge Massiah-Jackson was confronted on that morning at 9:30, when the hearing started, with new batches of cases which the district attorneys had submitted by letter dated March 6, which was the Friday before. However, my staff did not get these until 10:40 p.m. on March 10, long after I had retired. I saw these cases at 9 o'clock when I came to my office. I did not have any time to review them, and Judge Massiah-Jackson did not see them at all. 
Now, the most fundamental aspect of due process is notice and an opportunity to be heard and then a hearing. But the quintessential point about due process is notice. How can Judge Massiah-Jackson be called upon to respond to cases which she has not seen for a decade, or for 15 years? One of the cases involved a 1994 trial. Other cases involved 1988 and 1989 trials. It was said--and I think appropriately--that for Judge Massiah-Jackson to salvage her nomination last Wednesday she would have to hit a home run and the bases would have to be loaded. She was facing a very steep, uphill climb. But the reality was that she had no chance to do that because she was confronted with cases which were a decade old, or more. And when she said, `I do not recall,' it was taken that she should have recalled. 
It may not be a matter that is realized by Senators who are used to attending hearings, but when a witness appears before a hearing in the U.S. Senate, there is a certain amount of trepidation, especially when a judicial nominee appears in a Judiciary Committee hearing. There is a substantial amount of trepidation because that person's appointment to the Federal bench is on the line. 
I have seen many highly experienced trial lawyers with 30 years of practice at the bar, nominees who come from Pennsylvania whom I know very well, of great stature, of great aplomb, of great presence, come before the Judiciary Committee frightened like children in school, apprehensive, very, very nervous as to what is happening. And that is when they appeared before just a single Senator who is presiding at the hearing, or perhaps someone chairing the hearing and a ranking member from the minority party. Judge Massiah-Jackson walked into the hearing last Wednesday. The panel was loaded with people who were opposed to her, people who were asking her about cases which she had not had any notice of for a decade or for 15 years. 
Then, in an even more astonishing development, some of the Senators had transcripts which had been provided, according to the fax notes--you could see it on the transcripts--the night before at 5 o'clock in the evening. One transcript bore the note of `Philadelphia District Attorney's Office,' and another transcript bore the note `Philadelphia DA's Law Division.' So they had at least two fax machines, and both were busy turning out these faxes going to selected members of the Judiciary Committee--not to Arlen Specter, not to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, but going to certain members, and not to Judge Massiah-Jackson, who was then asked questions about them. 
It was true that the Senator said, `Well, now, you may not recollect this, and I know you have not seen these cases'--which were submitted with transmittal letters, as I said, on March 6, and as I previously said, which I had not seen until the morning of March 11 and Judge Massiah-Jackson had not seen at all --`but let's see if you could respond to the questions.' Well, when she says she doesn't remember, it doesn't look too good for her. When she is confronted with transcripts where the Senator's then say, `Well, maybe this will refresh your recollection,' and the transcript is read to her, and she does not remember, she doesn't look too good. 
So when she walked out of the hearing and the comments were she didn't do very well, she didn't remember the cases--how could she remember the cases? How could she do very well? What the district attorneys had done was water torture--drip, drip, drip, drip, drip. It started early on when the materials came in anonymously, drip, drip, drip, leading one member of the Judiciary Committee to say, without any foundation, `Looks like she is soft on crime'--drip, drip, drip. Then a hearing with Senator Santorum, Senator Biden, and myself in Philadelphia--nobody comes forward. Nobody has the courage to step forward and say, `I am opposed to this nominee,' as she had every right to expect, put her on fair notice, and give the Judiciary Committee a chance to evaluate their testimony. Then more anonymous materials--drip, drip, drip. In late October the Judiciary Committee has its hearings; and then drip, drip, drip. And it is true, they alerted some Members, who by last-minute holds deprived the Senate of having a vote at a time when the Senators were absent. Last week the majority leader did not schedule any votes, but materials came in in this matter. 
There is an inevitable chilling effect, Madam President, on what has happened, and its repercussions go far beyond Judge Massiah-Jackson. 
I said at the hearings that I thought it very unfortunate that Judge Massiah-Jackson should be called upon to answer questions put to her by district attorneys because there are so many State court judges in America who would like to be Federal court judges. I hardly know of any in Pennsylvania who do not want to be Federal court judges. The distinguished Presiding Officer came to see me last week with a member of the Supreme Court of Maine who wanted to be a judge on the First Circuit. That is the aspiration of so many lawyers and so many judges. If trial judges know that when they displease the district attorney who is trying a case before them that their records are likely to be sent anonymously and surreptitiously to the Judiciary Committee, what kind of an effect does that have on the administration of justice? How does a State court judge feel about ruling against a district attorney, or an assistant district attorney, in the context where Judge Massiah-Jackson was the victim of this water torture with people proceeding anonymously and then poisoning the waters in a way in which it was realistically impossible for her to answer? 
There was no way that Judge Massiah-Jackson could appear last Wednesday and talk about the cases which the district attorneys had submitted on February 2 when at every question she was confronted with cases, some 15 years old, where she had no notice. There is no way she could respond intelligently. And it was impossible for her to respond in a way which could convince fairminded people as 
to what the facts were. 
I talked to Members of the Senate who saw only the headlines, who saw only the comments, who saw only two statements which she had made which she shouldn't have made. But if someone is to be disqualified for making two intemperate statements, I don't believe there would be anyone in the U.S. Senate--not just the 100 of us who are here now, but anybody. If somebody is disqualified for a job for two intemperate statements, nobody could hold a job anywhere. 
So when you take a look at this record in its totality, what I have sought to do from the outset is to see that Judge Massiah-Jackson receives a fair hearing. It has been said that she is my nominee, which is not true. She is obviously the President's nominee. But she is not somebody who came from the Republican ranks. There is an arrangement which Pennsylvania has with the White House, with the President, that we will have the opportunity to name one Federal district court judge in Pennsylvania--Senator Santorum, and I--for every three nominees submitted from the Democratic Party. Pennsylvania is the only State, except for New York, which has had this arrangement, going back to the days of Senator Javits in the late 1970s. I am not obligated to back anybody whom the White House puts up. In fact, one of the nominees from Pittsburgh was rejected and withdrew earlier. 
So when people say I have made a deal, it is not true. Judge Bruce Kauffman was sworn in on January 20. He was the nominee submitted by Senator Santorum and myself. I have not promoted the nomination of Judge Massiah-Jackson. I did not know her before she was nominated by the President to this position. But it seems to me, know her or not, she was entitled to fairness, and, if there were objections against her, I wanted to hear of them. 
I have not begun to detail, Madam President, the lengths to which I went to find out what those objections were. When I heard comments through the grapevine, I called, or had my staff call, everybody who had a comment to make. When people wouldn't come forward, we asked them for the facts, and we proceeded with the objection. I personally made telephone calls to people and returned telephone calls to people to find out exactly what they had in mind, because if she was disqualified, let the chips fall where they may. 
But the procedures which have occurred here and really culminated in the hearing on March 11, I think, represent an occurrence which is not the Judiciary Committee's finest hour. I believe that questions should not have been put to her. She should not have been called upon to answer questions on matters that she had not heard about until that morning, matters which are 10 or 15 years old. 
There is ample precedent in the committees to exclude inappropriate lines of questions. One which received a great deal of notoriety was the Supreme Court nomination hearing for Justice Clarence Thomas. When someone had asked Justice Thomas about his video selections, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a Democrat, overruled his colleagues on that side of the aisle and said those questions were out of line. They may have had some relevancy, some tenuous relevancy. I don't think so, but some might have argued some attenuated relevancy to the issue before the Judiciary Committee at that time. 
But certainly they were vastly prejudicial compared to any value which they may have had, and a courageous chairman of the Judiciary Committee excluded that line of questioning. At the hearing I did not mince any words, but the first time I had an opportunity to speak, I referred to these new cases which had just been dropped on me that morning, which Judge Massiah-Jackson had not seen, and made the point that they ought not to be the subject for questioning. And when others on the Judiciary Committee had those transcripts which bore the facts from the Philadelphia district attorney's office the night before, I strenuously questioned the propriety of that and interrupted the chairman to express my views in no uncertain terms. 
Madam President, this case will not go away so easily. I agree with those who have said in the Chamber today that there has to be an adequate venting process and we have to find out about judicial nominees. I believe that the people who had objections to Judge Massiah-Jackson should have come forward many, many months ago. They had an opportunity to do so. There were inquiries by the FBI; there were inquiries by the American Bar Association; there were inquiries by the commission which Senator Santorum and I have established. They had an opportunity to raise those objections at a very early stage. But I do not deny them an opportunity to present adverse matters, however late they may come in, because a Federal judgeship is so important. But I do not believe that a nominee ought to be asked those questions without any notice and without any opportunity to review those cases. As we speak, there are units within the judicial conference and units within the bar association that are taking a very close look at what happened to Judge Massiah-Jackson. 
In concluding, I compliment and congratulate Mark Aronchick and John Morris of the Philadelphia Bar Association for their pro bono work in analyzing the cases which were submitted by the district attorneys, the first batch submitted on February 2, and for their very strenuous efforts in an analysis to find out what the facts were. They supported Judge Massiah-Jackson because she had scored very well on the plebiscites where the members of the Philadelphia Bar Association had been questioned. I would also like to thank Charles Bowser, Esquire, who counseled Judge Massiah-Jackson. 
I do appreciate and understand the reasons leading to Judge Massiah-Jackson's withdrawal. When she appeared in the hearings, she showed tenacity and courage, and she completed the record last week. But this is a time when the Senate Judiciary Committee has had better days, not a shining example for our Judiciary Committee, and the practices and procedures which were employed in this case need a thorough review so they will not be repeated. 
In the presence of no other Senator, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on the calls for Mr. Ken Starr to end his investigation and to urge the public and the media to give Mr. Starr an opportunity to finish his work, to put the issue on the back burner, to accord the President the presumption of innocence, to accord the same presumption to Mr. Starr--put the matter on the back burner so that we can focus on the pressing problems of Iraq, the budget, the highway bill and the other important matters to come before the Government. 
There has been much questioning of why Ken Starr has taken so long on the investigation of the Whitewater matter and how he has jurisdiction over the incident involving Ms. Monica Lewinsky. There has not been an explanation, to the best of my knowledge, as to the activities of Mr. Starr which have been expanded so substantially and the kind of delays which have necessarily been involved in the work of independent counsel, something that I understand, having been district attorney of Philadelphia and having run a number of grand jury investigations. 
People wonder why Mr. Starr has moved from Whitewater to Ms. Lewinsky. The fact of the matter is that he has done so at the specific request of Attorney General Reno. We know how circumspect Attorney General Reno has been with the appointment of independent counsel. But he was asked to do so because matters came to light which suggested a connection with the way that Mr. Webster Hubble was offered employment outside of the District of Columbia, arranged by a certain individual with a certain firm outside of Washington, DC, and then the same offer was made to Ms. Lewinsky. When these matters were called to the attention of Attorney General Reno, she asked Mr. Starr to expand his jurisdiction. 
But that was not the first call for the expansion of Ken Starr's jurisdiction. He was appointed as independent counsel on August 5, 1994, to take over the investigation which had been conducted by independent counsel Robert Fiske which involved the Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan matter which resulted in the conviction of three individuals, including the former Governor of Arkansas, Governor Tucker, and all aspects, including the alleged multimillion dollar fraudulent bankruptcy engaged in, again, by former Governor Tucker and two other individuals. 
Mr. Starr's jurisdiction was then expanded on May 22 of 1996 to investigate possible violations of Federal criminal law concerning the firing of White House Travel Office employees, a major investigation. 
Then another expansion of Mr. Starr's jurisdiction occurred on June 21, 1996, when he was asked to take over the investigation relating to matters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports for background investigations being turned over to the White House between December 1993 and February 1994, another highly controversial and complex matter. 
A third occasion was brought about where, again, Mr. Starr was asked to expand his jurisdiction on October 25, 1996, to determine whether White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum had violated Federal law before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. 
A fourth expansion of Mr. Starr's jurisdiction occurred on January 29 when he was asked to take a look at the issue as to whether Ms. Monica Lewinsky had suborned perjury, obstructed justice, intimidated witnesses or otherwise violated Federal law. 
If you take a look at just one item on the agenda of what Mr. Starr has had, and that is the investigation of former Governor Jim Guy Tucker, that matter occurred on his jurisdiction on September 2, 1994, when the Department of Justice confirmed Mr. Starr's jurisdiction. 
On June 7, 1995, the Little Rock grand jury returned a three-count indictment against Governor Tucker. 
On September 5, 1995, the district court dismissed the indictment. 
Then it was not until December 12, 1995, that Mr. Starr argued the matter before the eighth circuit asking that the indictment be reinstated and that the judge be removed. 
On March 5, 1996, the Eighth Circuit reinstated the indictment and dismissed the judge. 
Between March and October of 1996, Governor Tucker and two other defendants took appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States, which were not denied until October 7, 1996. 
On October 22, the case was assigned to another judge. The trial date was set on October 21 and an application for continuance was filed by Governor Tucker on October 31, and it was granted until March 17.

Mr. SPECTER. The long and short of this, Mr. President, is that from September 2, 1994, until February 20, 1998, the case involving former Gov. Jim Guy Tucker was pending with a whole series of complex legal maneuvers, until on February 20 of this year, former Governor Tucker entered a guilty plea and signed cooperative agreements. 
Without taking a look at the specifics, it is hard to see why Mr. Starr has taken so long. But this is just one item on the agenda, and the chronology shows why so much of the delay has occurred.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there have been frequent misunderstandings, as matters have been reported, one as recently as Senator Lott's--our distinguished majority leader--comments over the weekend talk shows with his statement about Mr. Starr ending his investigation being taken entirely out of context, something that Senator Lott has explained. 
Several weeks ago, I made a comment that I thought Attorney General Reno erred in appointing Mr. Starr to the Lewinsky matter because the American public would not understand why he was on the President's personal affairs after having started on Whitewater. No criticism at all of Mr. Starr, but it was my view that Mr. Starr would become a lightning rod for the investigation, taking focus away from the real subjects of the investigations. My comments were interpreted to be critical of Mr. Starr, which they, in fact, were not. 
I think it is true that Mr. Starr has not run a perfect investigation, and I commented publicly that it is not easy in the course of one of these complex matters, again relating to my own experience in operating grand juries as district attorney, when he brought before the grand jury certain witnesses on obstruction-of-justice charges, which seemed to me to be a misreading of the statute. 
But one thing that must be remembered is that the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno, has full authority to remove Mr. Starr or to limit his activities if she chooses to do so. In fact, her superior, the President of the United States, has the authority to order the removal of Mr. Starr, not saying he would do so in the light of our experience with the `Saturday Night Massacre.' But the Attorney General of the United States does supervise what is going on here and so does the three-judge court. 
Taken in its entirety, there is ample justification for the length of time which has been taken, 
and that if anybody other than Mr. Starr had been asked to take over the investigation relating to Ms. Monica Lewinsky on January 29, 1998, it would be hard to understand how anybody less than 2 months after that fact would be calling for him to terminate his investigation. 
So it is my hope that we will all take a deep breath, let Mr. Starr continue his investigation, put it on the back burner, take the pressure off the President, give him the presumption of innocence until the investigation is completed, and give Mr. Starr the similar presumption of propriety as to what he is doing so we can move forward to the very important business at hand in this country, including the ISTEA legislation. 
I note the hour of 10:45 has come. And ISTEA is the pending business which will occupy the country, much to the benefit of the country, contrasted with the matters relating to Mr. Starr and the President on that pending investigation. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Since the mid-1980's, I have worked with elected officials from Allegheny, Washington, and Fayette Counties, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, and the Mon Valley Progress Council to obtain funds for the Mon Valley-Fayette Expressway and Southern Beltway project, which has tremendous economic development potential from West Virginia into Pittsburgh and to the Pittsburgh International Airport. The seven segments of the Expressway and the Beltway will cost $2.5 billion to complete ($1.8 billion Mon Valley-Fayette, $700 million Southern Beltway) and will include 92.5 miles of new toll road in the Pittsburgh region. 
One of the more notable aspects of this project is that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has committed to providing $2 billion, or 80 percent, of the $2.5 billion, which is highly commendable and unusual. 
While I recognize that you do not wish to earmark projects in the pending bill, or I would have proposed such an amendment, Mr. Chairman, I would welcome your assurance that in conference you will keep this project in mind as an example of a project that merits consideration.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset, I congratulate my distinguished colleagues who have managed this bill, with special appreciation to Senator Chafee, Senator Baucus, Senator Warner, Senator D'Amato, and others. But in the final analysis, I feel constrained to vote against the bill because it reduces the share of federal highway funds for my State, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, under the formula. I will vote against the bill with reluctance, but I feel it important to register my disagreement, as will my distinguished colleague, Senator Santorum, with the hope that these disparities will be improved in conference. 
While opposing the bill for specific reasons, which I shall enumerate, there are many portions of the bill which I believe are very sound indeed as I will describe shortly. 
When one thinks of roads, highways, and bridges, one thinks of Pennsylvania. There are records of a public road in Philadelphia County dating back to 1696. Inspired by George Washington's own surveys as a means for western movement, one of the oldest highways in the nation is now U.S. Route 40 (the National Road), which passes through Somerset, Fayette, and Washington counties and was built between 1811 and 1818. And, the first privately built toll road, the Lancaster Pike, was constructed from 1792 to 1794. 
Now, as Pennsylvania prepares to enter the 21st Century, this legislation is of critical importance to the Commonwealth because it now has nearly 119,000 miles of public highways, with 27,183 miles eligible for federal highway funding and over 23,000 bridges over 20 feet in length which are eligible for federal rehabilitation and replacement funds (and of which 40 percent are classified as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete based on federal bridge criteria). 
There is much that is worthwhile in the ISTEA bill being considered by the Senate, including record levels of spending on highways and mass transit. Further, the bill contains funding for programs I support, such as the development of magnetic levitation transportation systems, innovative bridge research and development, and intelligent transportation systems. 
Nonetheless, I am greatly troubled that the pending bill would reduce Pennsylvania's share of the total highway formula from the 4.32 percent share under the original ISTEA law (FY92-97) to 3.79 percent. In actual dollars, Pennsylvania averaged $890 million annually through the original ISTEA law (including earmarked projects), whereas the Environment and Public Works Committee reported bill only provided Pennsylvania with an annual average from FY98-2003 of $836 million, an average reduction of federal spending of $53 million, making my State one of only two States to lose funds under the bill's new formula (Massachusetts being the other). Further, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, and Secretary Brad Mallory, with whom I have discussed the pending legislation, S. 1173 puts Pennsylvania at a disadvantage because it folds the federal bridge program into a larger funding scheme and will result in less funding for rehabilitating our more than 23,000 bridges. 
At a time when my travels throughout the Commonwealth suggest that there has never been a greater need to invest in Pennsylvania's roads, highways, and bridges this bill would undermine our ability to meet pressing needs in the 67 counties which comprise the Keystone State. 
During the last few months, as the ISTEA bill was drafted, considered in Committee, and brought to the floor, much has been made about `donor' States, `donee' States, and concepts such as `minimum allocation.' Senators from States which have felt aggrieved under previous formula allocations have instituted regional warfare and sought to prevent States such as Pennsylvania from retaining their share of spending from the Highway Trust Fund. 
While I am sympathetic to any Senator's wish to maximize federal spending in his or her State, it is not logical to presume 
that there must be percentage equities involved in our nation's infrastructure spending. In our federal system, and with such a diverse nation, there will always be differences in how much the government provides. In Pennsylvania, we are fortunate not to have the kind of earthquakes which rock California and necessitate billions in Federal disaster assistance. Similarly, we do not begrudge the millions spent by the Federal government on Florida's efforts to restore the Everglades, or the federal tax credits which are designed to stimulate oil and gas production in Oklahoma and Texas. 
As I noted in my letters with Senator Santorum to Chairman Chafee, Chairman Warner, and Senator Baucus dated September 12, 1997, Pennsylvania's contribution to the Nation is often through its roads and highways, which serve a vital role in interstate commerce, connecting East and West, as well as North and South. For economic, environmental, and safety reasons, there is a tremendous need to rehabilitate Pennsylvania's highway system, and I am deeply concerned that the funding level envisioned in this bill is not adequate to the task. 
Since the bill has been pending, it has been improved to some degree by the adoption of provisions designed to increase spending from the Highway Trust Fund. Initiated by the Byrd-Gramm amendment, which I cosponsored last Fall, this bipartisan effort to raise the highway funding levels in this bill met with some success. Particularly helpful was that the Byrd-Gramm amendment sought to increase funding for continued work on the Appalachian Regional Highway System, where Pennsylvania has the most miles of unfinished roads of any State included in the 13-State Appalachian region. 
On paper, the pending bill as amended by Senator Chafee's amendment suggests that Pennsylvania would receive an average of $955 million annually in highway apportionments, up from the $836 million figure in the version of the ISTEA bill reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee. However, the funds added by the Chafee amendment (based on the Byrd-Gramm amendment) are all dependent on how high an obligation ceiling is set each year by the Appropriations Committee. If the obligation ceiling on spending is not set high enough in the annual Transportation Appropriations bill, the figures anticipated by the Chafee bill will not materialize and Pennsylvania will be hardpressed to match the annual receipts from the original ISTEA formula. 
I am hopeful that in conference, where we have Chairman Bud Shuster from Pennsylvania, the chair of the House authorizing committee, the formula allocation will be made more equitable for Pennsylvania. But in the interim, I believe that my vote necessarily should be cast against this bill. 
Mr. President, while I have specified portions of the legislation that I am opposed to, I do want to acknowledge the significant increases for mass transportation where, through the leadership of Chairman D'Amato of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, some $5 billion has been added to the $36 billion already in the bill, which will facilitate to a number of very, very important mass transit projects. 
Because this is a significant bill with many aspects worth commenting on, I wish to note a few of its highlights. First, I am very pleased that Chairman D'Amato has shown such leadership in crafting a $41 billion reauthorization of federal transit programs, including $17 billion for discretionary grants overall of which nearly $8 billion will be for New Starts such as the Schuylkill Valley Metro from Philadelphia to Reading, the rehabilitation of the light rail system in Allegheny County, and possibly a light rail system in the Harrisburg-Carlisle area. 
As a member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, and as the co-chair of the Senate Transit Coalition, I have worked hard for several years to increase funding on mass transit. Last July, I introduced my own transit reauthorization bill (S. 764), 
the Mass Transit Amendments Act of 1997, with Senators Santorum and Lautenberg to give the Banking Committee some idea of the bipartisan consensus for increased transit spending. Accordingly, I am very pleased that the Banking Committee title represents real increases in transit spending, particularly now that a bipartisan group of Senators succeeded in obtaining the additional $5 billion in negotiations with the Leadership and Budget Committee Chairman Domenici. Once the $24 billion was added for highways, it was imperative to increase transit's share as well, and I was pleased to join Senator D'Amato, Senator Santorum, and 21 other Senators in a letter dated February 24 to the Republican and Democratic Leaders in which we called for the historic balance between highway and transit spending to be observed. 
I am pleased that the Senate accepted by voice vote 2 days ago my amendment to establish a Reverse Commute Program as a discretionary grant administered by the Federal Transit Administration. Recently, I visited the Bala Cynwyd station, which would serve a proposed 62-mile light rail system running from the center of Philadelphia to Reading, PA, known as the Schuylkill Valley Metro. This project exemplifies the type of reverse commute system that is very important because it can take people who need jobs from the inner city to the suburbs where employers are in need of employees. 
I had first proposed a Reverse Commute Program in S. 764 and believed that it was a worthwhile addition to the Banking Committee bill. My amendment, offered with Senators Santorum, Moseley-Braun and D'Amato, authorized this new $100 million/year program and increased from $100 million to $150 million the authorization for the new access to jobs/welfare to work program in the bill. The Reverse Commute Program is designed to facilitate access to suburban job opportunities for residents of cities, small towns, and rural areas. That is where mass transit can be most effective and where there is a great need for the federal government to stimulate the transportation marketplace. I am hopeful that this program will be preserved in conference and look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the House accepts it. 
The transit provisions also include a fix in the formula by which the fixed guideway modernization funds are allocated, so that Pittsburgh's system gets an incremental adjustment it has sought since the 1991 ISTEA law was enacted. 
I am also pleased to note that this bill contains the text of legislation which Senator Moynihan and I have cosponsored which will provide funding for the development of magnetic levitation, maglev, which has enormous potential to benefit the United States. 
Recently, I visited a maglev trial run in Germany on a train which traveled about 250 miles an hour, a really exhilarating experience. Maglev could provide transportation, nonstop, from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh in 1 hour 30 minutes. In 2 hours 7 minutes, the train could go from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh and could make intermediate stops at Lancaster, Harrisburg, Altoona, Johnstown, Greensburg, and then a final destination in Pittsburgh, with enormous economic development for those communities. With a slightly increased timespan, it could go to the State College and Lewistown as well. 
The cost of maglev, as represented to me, is about $20 million a mile, so a 300-mile run, approximately, from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh could be constructed at a cost of some $6 billion, which is not out of line when you consider the Los Angeles subway system is receiving a Federal allocation of some $3.1 billion of its $6 billion total cost. If we are to have economic expansion in the future, we do need to take care of the infrastructure. It ought to be noted that there are adequate funds to provide for this kind of funding in the highway trust fund, which has as its purpose highways, bridges and mass transit, to be used for that instead of being integrated into the overall budget to make the deficit look less problemsome. 
I have worked with MAGLEV, Inc. in Pittsburgh since the mid-1980's to obtain federal support for that company's effort to research and develop a maglev system in Pennsylvania. Now, we are at the brink of a maglev age, I believe, with MAGLEV, Inc. looking into a 60-mile route from Greensburg, Pennsylvania through Pittsburgh to the International Airport as its first segment at an estimated cost of $1.3 billion. 
Not only does maglev have the chance to revolutionize travel, it would mean billions of dollars in steel and construction materials and thousands of jobs for America's steelworkers and others who would fabricate the steel and concrete guideways. 
This bill provides a total of $30 million in contract authority in FY99 and FY2000 for capital assistance for development of a maglev system selected after a careful review by the Transportation Secretary, and more than $900 million in authorizations of appropriations in the outyears. While I would have preferred more contract authority, given the difficulties of obtaining substantial appropriations, it is important that this transportation bill recognize that the future of transportation may well be maglev and it merits an investment at this time. This bill, therefore, represents a real breakthrough for the efforts of MAGLEV, Inc. in Pittsburgh and others who support this new technology. 
I am pleased to note that the Senate accepted by voice vote my amendment, cosponsored by Senators Moynihan and Santorum, to extend eligibility for federal funding assistance to the pre-construction planning activities associated with maglev projects in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. I intend to fight to retain this amendment in conference with the House of Representatives and to work with the Secretary of Transportation to ensure that these funds are made available expeditiously to qualified entities, such as Pittsburgh's MAGLEV, Inc., which are well on their way to bringing this technology from the drawing boards to reality. 
It is also significant that the ISTEA bill includes a $100 million program for innovative bridge research and construction, which I sought with my colleagues on the Senate Steel Caucus in a letter to Chairman Chafee dated July 25, 1997. Our nation's bridges are rapidly deteriorating, presenting serious safety concerns to the traveling public and forcing restrictions on bridges unable to accommodate heavy vehicles. The need to invest more heavily in bridge infrastructure is clear, and this program will fund basic and applied research designed to develop innovative, cost-effective steel bridge applications to improve lifespan and performance, as well as fund field testing of this research. 
As we consider the ISTEA II bill, I remain convinced that Congress needs to do more to spend the funds which have accumulated and will continue to accumulate in the Highway Trust Fund and the Mass Transit Account. In 1991, during consideration of the original ISTEA bill, I offered an amendment to take the transportation trust funds off-budget for the purpose of ensuring that all federal gas tax receipts are spent on transportation infrastructure and not used to mask the true size of the deficit. In June, 1991, my amendment was defeated by a 29-69 vote, failing to obtain the 60 votes needed to waive the limitations of the Budget Act. Perhaps that amendment was ahead of its time, given the more recent success of Congressman Shuster in lining up support for his off-budget proposal. I believe that when Americans pay at the pump, either as individuals or on behalf of businesses, there is an understanding that their fuel taxes will be spent on improving the roads and bridges on which they are driving and improving mass transit. Accordingly, I am hopeful that my colleagues will soon entertain a proposal to take the transportation trust funds off budget or, at the very least, ensure that prospectively every dollar which comes in is spent on improving our transportation infrastructure. 
Among the positive elements of this bill which deserve commendation are the increases in funding for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) improvement program by an average of 18 percent over current levels. These funds are available with substantial flexibility to the State to provide to communities for projects reducing traffic congestion, such as the Pittsburgh Airport Busway, a significant mass transit project undertaken by the Port Authority of Allegheny County which will have a positive impact on air pollution in that region. 
I was pleased to cosponsor an amendment by Senator Jeffords which will establish a new grant program to preserve and rehabilitate our nation's historic covered bridges. In many parts of Pennsylvania, such as Berks County, covered bridges are tourist attractions which generate economic growth and necessary means of transportation for residents. Many are in substandard condition and these funds are intended to preserve this important element of our culture. 
Mr. President, reauthorizing the 1991 ISTEA law also provides Congress an opportunity to single out vital highway and transit projects throughout the nation for special funding. There are many, many projects which deserve such consideration, and, as I did in my Senate Floor statement of June 18, 1991, I think it worthwhile to comment on a few in my State of Pennsylvania. I cannot cover them all, of course, in these remarks, but the following highway and transit projects are indicative of the needs we have across the Commonwealth for improved, safer roads and for new public transportation facilities.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in support of the amendment I have offered with my distinguished colleagues, Senators Moynihan and Santorum, which clarifies that pre-construction planning activities are eligible for funding under Section 1119 of the bill, which establishes a magnetic levitation transportation technology deployment program. 
I have long supported the concept of maglev systems, where through the use of magnetic levitation, the passenger cars are propelled above a steel and concrete guideway at speeds as high as 300 miles per hour. In January, 1998, I rode the maglev being developed by Thyssen in Lathen, Germany at 422 kilometers per hour and it was exhilarating to be in a kind of mass transit which goes so fast. I am committed to bringing this technology to Pennsylvania, where it will create thousands of manufacturing jobs for steelworkers and high tech firms. It would be a tremendous boon to the economy of every stop along the line from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. People could go from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh in one and a half hours non-stop, revolutionizing our transportation system. Or, there would be intermediate stops in Harrisburg, Lewisburg, Altoona, Johnstown, and Greensburg, adding only about 40 minutes to the trip. 
Section 1119 of the pending bill reflects the provisions of the maglev funding bill introduced by Senator Moynihan, which I cosponsored, and would fund the capital costs associated with 1 maglev project chosen by the Secretary of Transportation. The bill includes $30 million in contract authority and more than $900 million in authorizations of appropriations for the outyears. However, in the absence of our amendment, the bill does not provide specific financial assistance for pre-construction planning activities. 
There are several States which have groups currently exploring the feasibility of maglev projects and which need federal assistance for pre-construction planning, feasibility studies, final design work, and environmental impact statements. States showing interest include California, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and Pennsylvania. 
The Specter-Moynihan amendment amends the bill to clarify that pre-construction planning activities are eligible project costs and that the Secretary may make grants to more than one maglev project for such pre-construction planning costs. Without such funds, it is unclear whether any project will be ready for the capital assistance envisioned in the current bill. 
Our amendment would make eligible for federal funds pre-construction planning activities include: (1) preparation of feasibility studies, major investment studies, and environmental impact statements and assessments as required by state law; (2) pricing of final design, engineering and construction activities; and (3) other activities necessary to provide the Secretary with sufficient information to evaluate whether the project should receive financial assistance for final design, engineering, and construction activities. 
I am particularly hopeful that this amendment will ultimately help MAGLEV, Inc., a nonprofit consortium in Pittsburgh, which has licensed the German technology and plans to build a state-of-the-art steel fabrication facility capable of constructing the steel guideways needed for a maglev system, which has the potential to create hundreds of jobs in the region. The first planned maglev system segment could be from Westmoreland County into downtown Pittsburgh and on to the Pittsburgh International Airport, at a projected cost of $1.3 billion. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this amendment is preserved in conference with the House and thank them for allowing it to be included in the bill.

Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to speak in support of the Jeffords-Specter amendment, which establishes a federal grant program to preserve our Nation's historic wood-covered bridges for future generations. 
There are 526 covered bridges nationwide, and almost 90 percent are in a critical state of disrepair. Pennsylvania enjoys the most covered bridges of any state, with 167. Unfortunately, the vast majority are either closed, or have weight limitations placed upon them to forestall further deterioration. Aside from the aesthetic reasons for repairing these bridges, there are safety implications as well for those who travel across them each day. 
The wood-covered bridges which dot the landscape across rural America serve as more than simply a tourist attraction. They are in essence a bridge to our past which allows us to better understand how previous generations worked to expand this Nation's transportation infrastructure and link communities together. It would indeed be a tragedy to allow them to simply waste away. 
It is estimated that approximately $344 million will be needed to bring all of our Nation's covered bridges up to standard. Our amendment would authorize $25 million each year over a period of seven years to restore and maintain these bridges, which are over 50 years of age. This would provide states with a much-needed dedicated source of funding to be used strictly for covered bridge preservation. 
As a member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I will work with my colleagues to ensure a steady funding stream once this program is authorized by passage of this amendment. 
If we do not act now, these national treasures will be lost forever. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and thank Senator Jeffords for his leadership on this issue. 
Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.

Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, on April 18, 1998, the Pennsylvania American Legion will honor its State Commander, Louise Chase, a World War II Navy veteran, who was elected Commander at the conclusion of the 79th convention on July 20, 1997. She is the first woman commander of the Department of Pennsylvania in its 80 year history. 
In 1979, Commander Louise Chase was elected as the Department of Pennsylvania's first woman vice commander. She has served twice as District Commander. Her Legion service also includes terms as Adjutant of Philadelphia County and the Eastern Judicial Section, two terms as Post Commander and 12 years as Adjutant of Tioga Post 319. She has also served as the organization's state legislative chairman and twice as chairman of the Select Committee on Economics and Benefits, as well as chairman of several other committees. 
She is one of only two Pennsylvania Legionnaires to have served on committees of the two National Conventions held in Pennsylvania. She served for 16 years as the Eastern Regional Vice Chairman of the United States Service Academies Selection Committee for Senators John Heinz and Harris Wofford. 
Commander Chase served in the U.S. Navy, with duty posting in Washington, D.C. during World War II. 
Her family has a long tradition of service to America dating from the Civil War, including her brother Tom who saw sea duty with the U.S. Navy off Cuban waters during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Her late father personally worked with the original astronauts while they were in training at the Johnsville Naval Air Development Center in Warminster, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. 
Her business career includes serving as controller and office manager of Philadelphia's prestigious Germantown Cricket Club for 13 years; controller of a construction company, plus manager of two of its high rise apartment buildings for 10 years; and manufacturers' representative for paper container companies for five years. She recently retired as an international marketing representative of a major computer manufacturer. 
Her husband, Joseph, was Pennsylvania American Legion Commander in 1991-1992. The two live in Horsham, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. 
Madam President, I congratulate Commander Louise Chase for her service to the veterans of Pennsylvania. I am certain that the Testimonial Dinner being held in her honor on April 18, 1998 will be a fitting tribute to her years of service to The American Legion, veterans, and to her country.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on the occasion of the retirement of Fred Hitz as the Central Intelligence Agency's first Presidentially-appointed Inspector General, I want to offer my comments and congratulations. Since the position of an independent Inspector General for the CIA was created at my initiative in the FY 90 Intelligence Authorization Act and since I have come to know Fred Hitz during my tenure as Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it is fitting that I recognize his contributions. 
By way of background, it became clear during the Iran-Contra investigations that the Central Intelligence Agency lacked an effective Office of Inspector General which not only could conduct thorough and objective internal investigations of CIA activities, but even more so, could exercise authority and independence to ensure that its investigative recommendations regarding individual accountability and systemic shortcomings would be followed through and implemented. The proposal to create a Presidentially-appointed and Senate-confirmed independent Inspector General was met with fierce resistance by the Administration and the Director of Central Intelligence. Nonetheless, in light of the revelations from the Iran-Contra affair, the Congress recognized the need for such an office. In my mind, the establishment of an independent Inspector General for the CIA was the most effective piece of legislation to derive from the Iran-Contra affair. 
It was in this atmosphere that Fred Hitz was nominated by President Bush in 1990, confirmed by the Senate in October 1990 and sworn in November 1990. The Congress wanted a strong-willed and independent individual who was knowledgeable of CIA's mission, history and activities and who had the fortitude and skills to identify, investigate and report wrongdoing when he saw it and how he saw it. Over the past seven years Fred Hitz has accomplished this mandate with honor and diligence in a sea of controversial investigations. 
One of the most important, if not the most important, of the investigations undertaken by Fred Hitz was that of the Aldrich Ames case which provided the Intelligence oversight committees and the public details of Ames' treachery and insight into CIA. In addition, Fred Hitz has been fearless in taking on difficult and controversial issues such as the role of intelligence in the BCCI and BNL scandals, human rights abuses in Guatemala and Honduras, allegations of drug trafficking by the Contras, the compromise of CIA operations in Paris, and CIA involvement in providing assistance to a Presidential campaign contributor. The Senate Intelligence Committee has not always agreed with Fred's judgements in these matters; it never has questioned his integrity. 
Upon the completion of Fred's fifth year as CIA's Inspector General, Senator Bob Kerrey and I led a bi-partisan resolution in the Senate to commend Fred for his leadership and achievements. 
In his lifetime, Fred Hitz has made an important contribution through his public service. As an attorney who graduated from Harvard Law School, he could have remained in the private sector and reaped handsome financial rewards. He chose instead to invest over 20 years in public service, and the United States government and his country have been the chief beneficiaries. 
Fred entered public service by teaching law in Nigeria and in 1967 he entered the CIA. From 1974 to 1978 he served in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, as a Senior Staff Member for Energy Policy in the Office of the President and as Director of Congressional Affairs at the Department of Energy. In 1978 he returned to the CIA where he served as Legislative Counsel to the Director of Central Intelligence and later as Deputy Director of the Europe Division in the Directorate of Operations. 
In my view, Mr. Hitz completes one of the most demanding assignments in the federal government--Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency. He has journeyed through the shoals of hawks and doves, public reporting and security demands and admirers and detractors by sailing a straight and visible course with honesty, dignity and truthfulness. His efforts have made the Central Intelligence Agency more accountable and thus more in consonance with a Congressional view of the rightful role of intelligence and secrecy in a democracy. For these qualities, Fred Hitz will be missed and I wish him smooth sailing in his new teaching career.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment works on reverse commute projects, which are designed to enable people to come from the inner city where there are no jobs available and to go to the suburbs where jobs are available. This is, in part, the reverse commute pilot project introduced by my distinguished colleague, Senator Santorum, and myself along with Senator Lautenberg in the `Mass Transit Amendments Act,' S. 764. We think it is appropriate to include it on the ISTEA legislation at this time. 
This program essentially responds to the growing need to provide access to suburban employment opportunities for residents of cities and rural areas who wish to continue living in their city or rural town and need mass transit to get to the jobs. This amendment will also increase from $100 million to $150 million the access-to-jobs, welfare-to-work provision already in ISTEA under the Banking Committee bill as introduced by the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun. My amendment establishes a new $100 million annual authorization for reverse commute grants, bringing the total access-to-jobs/reverse commute program to $250 million annually. 
A week ago yesterday I visited a reverse commute project, the Schuylkill Valley Metro project, envisioned by SEPTA and BARTA. This rail line would run from the inner city of Philadelphia to Reading, through Montgomery County, through Philadelphia County, and into Berks County. It is an excellent illustration of what is necessary in order to take people from the inner city where people need jobs out to the suburbs where the jobs are available. 
This is a very abbreviated statement of a complex bill, but one which I think is designed to meet a very, very pressing need, especially in an era where we are moving away from welfare, to take people who have been on the welfare rolls in the inner cities and provide them with job opportunities in the suburbs. 
If I might yield to the distinguished chairman, there is an addendum to the bill which I have added at the chairman's request which he said he would comment on briefly.  
Mr. DAMATO addressed the chair.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island for yielding me 12 minutes. Perhaps I shall not need it all. 
I have sought recognition to speak in opposition to the pending amendment, because I think the statute, as it is presently drawn, is constitutional. 
The most recent articulation of the guiding legal principles were set forth in Adarand, and Justice O'Connor for the Court said that strict scrutiny does not require the elimination of a program designed to protect those who have been discriminated against as long as there is the requisite narrow tailoring. 
She noted the underlying factual basis which does persist to this day: 
The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it. 
That is precisely what is being done in the statute at hand. 
Justice O'Connor noted that as recently as 1987, every Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States agreed that the Alabama Department of Public Safety's `pervasive, systematic and obstinate discriminatory conduct' justified a remedy, and it was upheld in the case of United States v. Paradise. 
Even Justice Scalia, in his concurrence in the City of Richmond v. Croson, noted that there was at least one circumstance where the State may act to `undo the effects of past discrimination.' 
When we deal with this area, it is an extraordinarily complicated matter and it is very fact-sensitive. I think it is important to note that the statute in question here does not involve the same underlying law which was at issue in Adarand. 
In Adarand, the issue involved the Department of Transportation's use in its own direct contracts of Federal compensation to encourage Federal prime contractors. This issue involves the constitutionality of section 1003(b)(3) of ISTEA, which sets a 10-percent goal for expenditures of authorized funds for disadvantaged business enterprises. 
The effort has been made in a very strenuous and, I think, successful way to accomplish the kind of narrow tailoring which was called for in Adarand and which is constitutionally mandated.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the cases in this area have been very complicated, very fact-sensitive, customarily decided, or frequently decided, on a 5-4 basis. There are very, very important objectives in the pending statute. There is a general agreement 
that quotas are wrong for America, and I believe, beyond that, it is inappropriate to give an applicant a position where the applicant is less well-qualified than some other applicant. 
I am convinced that if we take the applications for Yale or Harvard or Duke or Cornell or any other fine educational institution, that if there was to be sufficient outreach, we would find minorities who would be well-qualified to take positions in those institutions and that they would not, in fact, be displacing someone who was better qualified. It is a matter of outreach. What the legislation at hand seeks to do is to implement that concept of outreach. 
There has been a glass ceiling as to women, which is very well known. The glass ceiling is at ground zero. It is very hard to break into the kind of construction trades which are at issue in this ISTEA legislation. There is no doubt about the problems that other minorities have had. This is a plan to provide that outreach and that opportunity without displacing better qualified individuals or better qualified firms. 
For the argument to be made that this act is unconstitutional and that Members of the Senate are sworn to uphold the Constitution, drawing the suggested inference that we are violating our oaths of office in supporting the legislation as is currently written, I think is far, far beyond the mark, to put it in a very, very diplomatic context. 
This is an important provision. I believe that it is constitutional as applied with the narrow tailoring of the Department of Transportation regulations and that it meets the obligations of strict scrutiny under the U.S. Constitution. As a matter of public policy, it moves in the right direction. 
This is only one of many efforts by the Government to open the door on outreach, and I believe that is a very, very sound proposition. 
In my own personal experience as district attorney of Philadelphia, when I had hiring of a great many people as my responsibility, I got the list of all the African American lawyers in the city when I took office and made a systematic effort to call them on a matter of outreach and found that I could locate very well-qualified people to take the positions, not giving them any preference, not giving them any affirmative action in the sense of having people take those jobs who are less well-qualified than others who apply for them. 
The same thing followed in the detective branch where the detectives, men and women, were selected from the Philadelphia Police Department. It was a matter of outreach. It did take a little more effort to interview more people to find those in the minority who were well-qualified and that they did not displace better qualified people to accomplish that result. 
As long as we have a system which does not discriminate against the better qualified, I think we have a system which is sound and is a matter of outreach, which is very important in this country today. 
I intend to oppose the pending amendment, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the pending amendment. 
I thank my colleague from Rhode Island. I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce vocational training legislation, entitled the `Job Preparation and Retention Training Act of 1998,' which is designed to respond to the need for pre-vocational training assistance to enable welfare recipients to make the transition from public assistance to work. 
I believe that the historic 1996 welfare reform law will serve the American people well by ending systemic dependence and creating a program that emphasizes employment--gainful and permanent employment--by giving the States greater flexibility in administering their programs. We are already hearing about the rise in employment rates and the substantial drops in State welfare rolls. 
While many Americans have effectively made the transition from welfare to work, a need exists for skills training to enable many of the individuals who have been long-term welfare recipients to make transitions into unsubsidized employment that provides career potential and enables the individuals to achieve economic self-sufficiency. 
Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I believe that it would be worthwhile to recognize the need for pre-vocational training, a type of training that is not formally offered by the U.S. Department of Labor. 
Current Federal law does not adequately address the tremendously negative effect of unfavorable environmental and cultural factors on the ability of such individuals to obtain and retain gainful employment. 
I believe that a Federal commitment to the development of pre-vocational training programs should focus on: improving the job readiness of individuals who are welfare recipients and preparing the individual psychologically and attitudinally for employment. 
The bill I am introducing today would authorize funding for States to enroll chronic welfare dependents into a training program which would provide the necessary skills to locate and maintain employment. The Secretary of Labor would award States grants on a competitive basis for use in teaching individuals to fulfill workplace responsibilities such as punctuality, literacy, communication, and other survival skills. Once an adult has completed this short period of training, he or she would be prepared to get the most out of their job training and unsubsidized employment opportunities. The $50 million authorization would be provided for each of the next two years. The sunset will provide a chance to determine the program's efficacy. Further, training funds would be limited to no more than $1,200 per individual, which I am advised is a realistic cost of skills training and job placement programs. 
Many community-based organizations across the country have already recognized this need and are providing pre-vocational training. In this limited context, we have found that prevocational trainees have fared much better in the economy. I am advised that one such community-based organization, the Opportunities Industrialization Centers of America, Inc., has found that the average hourly wage of trainees prior to pre-vocational training was $3.70, not even a minimum wage. After receiving pre-vocational training, these same participants started earning an average of $8.00 an hour. Further, pre-vocational training resulted in an 85% placement rate into better-paying jobs. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this legislation. This bill is intended to enhance welfare reform and it does not tamper with the positive changes in existing law, such as the five-year time limit. Simply, I am asking for continued federal involvement in ending generational welfare.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting against Senator Wellstone's amendment because I think it is inappropriate to place it on the pending bill, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. 
I do believe it is a good idea to have the Secretary of Health and Human Services obtain information from the States as to the impact of the welfare reform law on current and former recipients of federal aid, but this critical transportation bill should be moved as expeditiously as possible to get highway, transit, and safety funding moving to the States and our communities as rapidly as possible. 
When the 1996 welfare reform law was considered, I noted that only time will tell if that legislation resulted in an unacceptable level of hardship on poor Americans, particularly children. Current law contains data collection requirements with respect to the impact of the changes in welfare law, and as Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee which funds the Department of Health and Human Services, I was pleased to provide $26 million for Fiscal Year 1998 for the Department to undertake the kinds of research and analysis we need to determine the true impact of the 1996 law. Further, as Chairman, I will continue to monitor closely the Department's performance in administering the new welfare regime. If Senator Wellstone offers this amendment on an appropriate bill, I will likely support it.

Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition for two reasons: 
First, to comment about the Schuylkill Valley Metro Light Rail System, which I visited this morning. It is a very fine example of what can be accomplished with light rail, for many purposes. It seeks to establish a light rail commuter line from city hall in Philadelphia to Reading, Pennsylvania, a stretch of some 72 miles, which would be enormously helpful in transporting people from the inner city to the surrounding counties in the Philadelphia area where there is a labor shortage, to move people from areas where people need jobs to areas where employers need people to fill jobs. 
This line would further be enormously helpful, to take pressure off of the Schuylkill Expressway, an alleged high-speed line in the Philadelphia area which is more frequently a parking lot as opposed to a high-speed line. It would further be enormously helpful on the problems of air pollution, as a tremendous stream of traffic moves from the suburbs over the Schuylkill Expressway and U.S. route 422. 
The cost of this light rail system would be $720 million, with the Federal share being $576 million. Congressman Jon Fox joined me today at the area where we took a look at the proposal, and I think it is really a very, very useful use of ISTEA funds. It is my hope that, as we move ahead with the so-called ISTEA legislation, we will make a very substantial investment in infrastructure and that the higher figure will be adopted by the Senate, by the House, and by the conferees as we move through this important legislation. 
I have joined over the years in efforts to take the highway trust fund off budget so it will be used for the specific purpose for which it was intended. I know in my State there are an enormous number of important projects which could be funded if the highway trust fund were to be used for highways, bridges and mass transit. I have confidence that the same exists around the country.

Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I now seek to discuss, or comment, on the escalating war between the President and independent counsel and to urge the independent counsel to reply forcefully in the public forum to attacks, as opposed to the use of the grand jury as a means of investigating the people who are proposing and undertaking those attacks. My own sense is that independent counsel would be well advised to reply to his critics in a public forum, and by that I do not mean in his driveway in the morning, but, when criticized, to reply. I have had some experience as a prosecutor running grand jury investigations, and it is an inevitable consequence that, when someone is under investigation, that person, persons or entity, will not like the investigation. I think it would be enormously useful if the American people knew, for example, why Mr. Starr is in the investigation on President Clinton's personal affairs. 
People ask the question, how did he move from the investigation of an Arkansas land deal, where he has been engaged for many years at very substantial cost, over to the investigation of the President on his personal matters? There is a very direct answer, but one which I think very few people know. That is that Attorney General Reno asked Mr. Starr to conduct this investigation. That request was made by the Attorney General about 6 weeks ago. We all know that Attorney General Reno is very reluctant to authorize investigations by independent counsel, with many of us having urged her to do so on campaign finance reform to no avail. So, when Attorney General Reno authorizes an investigation, there is a good indication that it is for a very, very strong cause. But people do not know that Mr. Starr got into this matter in relation to his authorized investigation of Webster Hubbell. And information came to Mr. Starr from Linda Tripp about an effort to secure employment for Ms. Monica Lewinsky under circumstances identical for Webb Hubbell, with the allegation being, and the inference being, that it was hush money for Webster Hubbell. 
Linda Tripp came to Mr. Starr and Mr. Starr knew Ms. Tripp from his previous contacts with her when she was a witness in the Foster suicide and on Filegate. Ms. Tripp told Mr. Starr that Ms. Lewinsky had stated that a given individual had sought employment for Ms. Lewinsky outside of Washington, DC, with a specific firm, and that happened to be an identical firm--an identical individual who had made similar arrangements for Mr. Hubbell. 
Mr. Starr then put a consensual electronic surveillance on Ms. Tripp, that is, consensual by Ms. Tripp. And Mr. Starr has been 
continually criticized for having conducted an unlawful electronic surveillance as recently as yesterday's TV talk shows. The fact of the matter is, Mr. Starr ought to make this point and ought to make it emphatically, that the one-party consent to the electronic surveillance was perfectly lawful under the law of Virginia where it took place. 
After the electronic surveillance confirmed for Mr. Starr what Ms. Tripp said, Mr. Starr then took the matter to the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice and said, here is the evidence. There are a number of alternatives. One is the Justice Department can handle the matter itself. Second, the Justice Department can seek other independent counsel. Or, third, the Justice Department could refer, Mr. Starr recounts, to Mr. Starr. The matter was then taken to Attorney General Reno, who said it was her decision to authorize Mr. Starr to conduct further investigation related to the Ms. Monica Lewinsky matter, and that was then confirmed by the three-judge court which authorizes Mr. Starr's conduct. 
Now, at that time, obviously, Attorney General Reno knew about the electronic surveillance and, in asking Mr. Starr to conduct the investigation, there was, I think, fairly stated, more than implicit approval of what Mr. Starr had done, but really explicit approval of what Mr. Starr had done. 
There has been very, very substantial comment on the question of executive privilege. And, in looking at the news media reports on comments about this legal issue, they appear, really, to be authored by people who are advocates for the President's position. The law on executive privilege is well established, has been since the case of United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, and it applies, as outlined by the Supreme Court of the United States on page 706 of U.S. Reports, volume 418, executive privilege applies to `protect military, diplomatic or sensitive national security secrets.' Well, there is nothing of that nature involved in the investigation of the President's personal activities. Executive privilege applies to matters which are carried out by the Executive in his official capacity, again, not in his personal capacity. 
There have been commentaries on the issue of the lawyer-client privilege as it would apply to a number of witnesses now appearing before the grand jury, and the speculation is that it is on Mr. Bruce Lindsey. Just as the claim of executive privilege might be applied to Mr. Bruce Lindsey, or perhaps to Mr. Blumenthal, we are not really sure, but there is very strong legal authority in a case decided by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals handed down on May 2, In re--Grand Jury Subpoena Decus Tecum, 112 F.3d 910. This is part of the controversy and contest between the White House and Mr. Starr--this case lays out, at page 920 of 112 Federal Reporter on the Third Series: Executive branch employees, including attorneys, are under a statutory duty to report criminal wrongdoing by other employees to the Attorney General. 
Mr. Lindsey, who is an attorney, can hardly be in an attorney-client relationship to the President when he is a governmental employee. The court goes on to point out that the way a person retains a lawyer to have the attorney-client privilege is a very direct way, and that is the person retains his own counsel and not looking to a governmental employee to be the counsel. A governmental employee like Mr. Lindsey or other attorneys have their fiduciary obligation running to the Government of the United States. It does not run to anyone else with whom they have contact, even the President of the United States. The express statutory authority set out in 28 U.S.C, section 535(b) establishes the obligation of any governmental employee, including attorneys, to report evidence of wrongdoing to the Attorney General of the United States. 
The way these matters are commented upon on the talk shows and in the press and in the media, it appears that there is some strong ground to assert executive privilege. To call it frivolous would be elevating it to a higher level than it deserves. It is absolutely, positively a stalling tack, nothing more and nothing 
less. It could not possibly apply. Some may argue that the Eighth Circuit opinion is not binding on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, but those who have referred to it in the media make the suggestion that it applies only in St. Louis. The fact of the matter is that it's a Circuit court opinion, it is very persuasive, and there is no authority to the contrary. It is based upon a principle of law which is hard to dispute, and that is that an attorney employed by the Government and paid by the Government owes a duty to the Government and has a statutory duty to report crime to the Attorney General, not to another governmental employee, even the President of the United States, who happens to employ him. 
So we have a series of events where there is a very, very strong proposition that what is being undertaken here in this war, this escalating war between the President and independent counsel, really talks about legal propositions which are spurious and frivolous at best. It would be my hope that the independent counsel would respond to the President in the public news media. I know that prosecutors who are investigating cases do not like to disclose what is going on in a pending prosecution, and there are good reasons as a general matter for investigators or prosecutors on an investigative matter not to make disclosures but to keep those matters confidential. But when those prosecutors conducting these investigations are attacked in the public news media, there is absolute justification for a response. 
I believe that Mr. Starr made a mistake when he called people before the grand jury last week such as Mr. Blumenthal, in giving Mr. Blumenthal a platform. I made mistakes myself when I was District Attorney of Philadelphia. I made some in the U.S. Senate. And just because Mr. Starr made a mistake does not mean that he is disqualified from carrying on as independent counsel. It does not mean that he ought to resign, as some Members of the other side of the aisle have suggested. The fact is that the Attorney General of the United States has the authority, under the independent counsel statute, to remove Mr. Starr for cause, and the President has the authority, through the Attorney General, to remove Mr. Starr for cause. We have already gone through that once in our Nation's history under a circumstance, the so-called Saturday Night Massacre. But if Mr. Starr is doing things which require his discontinuance in office, that can be handled by the Attorney General. And no suggestion has been made that he ought to be removed. Nor do I think there is any basis for saying that. 
When Mr. Starr has found his assistants under attack, it is understandable that there would be a very strong reaction. 
Two of his assistants were attacked, one a Mr. Emmick. The information was spread broadly in the news media that an assistant independent counsel, Mr. Emmick, was criticized by a judge for using `threats, deceit, and harassment to get testimony in a 1994 police corruption case.' But the fact of the matter is that the court transcript showed that the `threats, deceit, and harassment' had been directed at another Federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, and the same judge called Mr. Emmick `a man of integrity' at a hearing a year later. 
These matters do not come out. I think that what Mr. Starr has to do is make a very forceful defense of his assistants. 
Similarly, an associate independent counsel, a Mr. Udolf, had been reputedly fined some $50,000 in a Georgia civil proceeding for violating the civil rights of someone who was wrongfully held in jail for 4 days in 1985. But others have come to his defense. The retired Federal chief judge, Judge A. R. Kenyon, said that Mr. Udolf `was very sensitive and always had compassion for people even though he had to prosecute them.' 
The point is that there are going to be criticisms, and in the course of a legal career, prosecuting attorneys may be censured, and the nature of a criminal proceeding very frequently is very highly charged, very emotional, a lot of things are said by both sides with frequently considerable provocation. But whatever is said, it is my view that Mr. Starr ought to respond in a public contest and ought to do it very, very promptly, again, without resorting to the matter of the grand jury to bring people in there. 
The stepped-up attacks on Mr. Starr may carry the suggestion that he is getting closer. Dick Morris observed last week that the testimony of former Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker might prove to be very, very significant, perhaps decisive in the Arkansas land deal. I do not know whether that is true or not, but I do know that if you take a look at the chronology of events which lasted for years before Mr. Starr could bring former Governor Tucker to trial, it was a long, tough road which took a very protracted period of time, including overturning a judgment where an Arkansas Federal judge dismissed the indictment, the indictment later being reinstated by the court of appeals, and the court of appeals even granting the independent counsel motion to have that judge removed from the case. 
So where you have a protracted period of time and very considerable money spent, it is relevant to note what has happened in the matter, these facts really not being known at all by the public and not being known by me unless I take a look to see exactly what is going on behind the veil. 
When Attorney General Reno appointed Mr. Starr to expand the jurisdiction to cover the President's personal activities, I made a comment that was widely misinterpreted and widely misconstrued. I said 2 weeks ago that Attorney General Reno had erred in appointing Mr. Starr because people would not understand what he was doing in that case in light of the fact that he started off a long time before in the Arkansas land deal and that it was unfortunate because Mr. Starr has become a lightning rod. 
No longer is there a focus of attention on what President Clinton has done, and he is, allegedly, supposedly the object of the investigation, but the attention has been focused only on Mr. Starr. I do not believe that Attorney General Reno had in mind when she appointed Mr. Starr that the appointment would prove to be such a formidable public relations defense for the President, directing attention away from the President as the focus of the investigation to Mr. Starr. But that is certainly what has happened. It is in no way a criticism of Mr. Starr that the Attorney General asked him to take over the investigation and that he has become a lightning rod. 
That is where we find this matter. I believe the lightning rod has to exchange and reply in kind, and if it calls for lightening, so be it. 
I went to high school in a small town in Russell, KS--Russell High School, which had a football team known as the Broncos. There 
is another football team not too far from Russell called the Broncos, the Denver Broncos, who were the Super Bowl champions. When I look at this battle, this war being waged with the President, on one hand, and the independent counsel on another, I analogize it to a football game between the Broncos who are the Super Bowl champs and the Broncos from my old high school football team. 
If the playing field is to be leveled to any significant extent at all, I believe that Mr. Starr has to respond. The appropriate way to respond is exactly when these criticisms are made. 
It is my hope and my understanding that Mr. Starr is not going to pursue the business of calling his critics before the grand jury. I think Mr. Starr, a former Federal judge, a former solicitor general, knows better than to argue that the first amendment is only for articulating the truth. Who knows what the truth is when you have a controversy, or who knows what the eye of the beholder is as to what the truth is? The first amendment is to protect freedom of speech. You cannot get involved in limiting it to who is telling the truth or it would be a never, ever ending controversy. 
I hope that we will put this war between the President and the independent counsel on the back burner. I hope that we will presume the President to be innocent and that we will presume Mr. Starr to be innocent and to let the investigation go forward until it is concluded so that the President and the rest of us can focus our attention on the important items facing the country, like this important legislation, ISTEA, on the infrastructure spending of America for the next 6 years; on the enormous problems we are facing in Iraq; on the problems we are facing in balancing the budget and how to handle the $1.7 trillion funding which we now have to apply to America's problems. 
But if the debate is to rage and if it is to continue, it is my hope that the grand jury will not be the place where Mr. Starr's critics come, but that he will engage in forceful, lusty debate and express himself and answer his critics and let the chips fall where they may. 
I thank the Chair, yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to reintroduce legislation I originally introduced on November 8, 1997, to reauthorize the work of the Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor Commission in Pennsylvania. The new bill makes some technical changes which deal with method of appointing Commission members, ensuring that the Commission will continue to be composed of representatives from local and state agencies who have worked on this successful public/private partnership with the federal government over the past 10 years. I am hopeful that the Subcommittee on National Parks, Historic Preservation, and Recreation of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources will hold hearings on this bill as soon as possible. Since authorization for the Commission is set to expire in November, 1998, it is vital that the Senate pass this legislation this year to enable the Commission to continue its unfinished work in eastern Pennsylvania.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I now offer a resolution that seeks to deal with the international crisis caused by Saddam Hussein's amassing of weapons of mass destruction. There are reports as of this morning that Secretary General Kofi Annan has solved the problem after discussions with Saddam Hussein. A diplomatic solution is always preferable to a military solution, even though Saddam Hussein has carried the world to the brink of war. Before we will know whether or not Secretary General Kofi Annan has succeeded, we will have to read the fine print. 
In the event that the Secretary General's efforts to end the crisis are unsuccessful, I submit that it is a constitutional imperative that Congress consider, debate, deliberate, and vote on a resolution on how to deal with this threat before the President takes unilateral action with air and missile strikes. 
Air and missile strikes constitute acts of war. Under the U.S. Constitution, only the Congress has the authority to involve our Nation in war. In his constitutional capacity as Commander in Chief, the President may act in emergencies, but there is now time for deliberative action by the Congress. 
During the week of February 9, when this issue was the talk of the caucuses and the cloakrooms, Congress spoke loudly by not speaking at all because there was no agreement on what should be done. On February 16, I wrote the President urging that no military action be taken until Congress returned from the recess today, February 23. With the prospect of unilateral Presidential action, if Secretary General Annan is unsuccessful, I believe it is our duty in both the Senate and the House to take a position on this obviously critical issue of war or peace before the President takes unilateral action with a military strike. 
My resolution is an alternative to the approach outlined by the President on February 17. Without deciding whether I would vote to support the President's plan, I am submitting this alternative because I think it is a preferable course of action and, perhaps even more importantly, to stimulate debate in the Congress which could produce an even better course of U.S. action. The issues that now confront our Nation are complex, controversial, and could produce unintended consequences. I do not contend that my resolution provides all the answers, or even necessarily the best answer, but it could lead to the least of the available undesirable alternatives, and that is what I think we face, Mr. President--a question of which is the least of the undesirable alternatives. 
At the outset, let there be no doubt that it is my view that Saddam Hussein's amassing weapons of mass destruction is intolerable and must be stopped. If the United States takes action, there must be national unity behind our fighting forces, but that doesn't mean giving the President a blank check in advance by delegating to the executive the Congress' constitutional duties. 
Again, without committing myself on how I will vote if the President's plan is submitted to Congress in a resolution, I do wish to express my deep reservations and concerns for the following reasons: 
First, the President's plan does not reach the core issue of removing Saddam Hussein as Iraq's leader or in eliminating his weapons of mass destruction. The maximum result, as articulated by the President in his own words, is `to seriously diminish the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction.' But there is the understanding or concession in that statement that there would only be a serious diminution, not an elimination, of weapons of mass destruction. The President then noted that if such weapons are rebuilt, there would be another strike. Such a series of strikes, which could be indefinite for all we know, are hardly the answer. 
Saddam Hussein's continuous flouting of his specific agreements and U.S. mandates since 1991 requires removing him from office as the only adequate answer. 
My second concern is that U.S. air and missile strikes, aided only by Great Britain, could materially hurt our position as the world leader, or at least as the leader of the free world. We are, after all, seeking to enforce the U.N. position on Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction and that Iraq must comply with those U.N. resolutions and yield to U.N. inspections. 
When we arrogate unto ourselves, with only Great Britain's concurrence, the decision to undertake air and missile strikes, on this state of the record, we are likely to be viewed by the world as arrogant, which is the root meaning of arrogating unto ourselves that ultimate decision. 
In my foreign travels, I have found enormous respect and admiration for the United States around the world. People everywhere admire and really envy our freedom, our democratic values, our standard of living, and our power. But, in a January trip to Europe, the Mideast and North Africa, I heard virtually unanimous objections to the proposed U.S. air and missile strikes on Iraq as an abuse of power and U.S. arrogance. The key part of that arrogance involves projected Iraqi civilian casualties and our insistence on acting as we see fit, contrasted with the views of the other nations, almost uniformly with the exception of Great Britain. 
Third, air and missile strikes may cause devastating unintended consequences. Our experience has demonstrated that we may expect retaliation from terrorists. The bombing of Libya in 1986 produced the bombing of Pan Am 103. Our so-called covert proposals against Iran most probably produced the terrorist attack on Khobar Towers in June of 1996. 
On the issue of unintended consequences, who can be sure what will happen if we detonate Iraq's biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction and those substances enter the atmosphere? In March 1991, allied forces detonated Iraq's chemical weapons at Kamasia. Those substances became airborne and may have been a significant contributing cause to Gulf War syndrome, an issue now under intensive investigation by the Veterans Affairs Committee, which I chair. 
The resolution, which I am submitting today, strikes at the core of the problem: removing Saddam Hussein as Iraq's leader by prosecuting him as an international war criminal; and, if he is not taken into custody as a war criminal, by then implementing a long-term plan for his removal as Iraq's President. 
My basic proposal to try Saddam Hussein as an international war criminal was advanced on March 5, 1991, at the conclusion of the Gulf War. On that day I introduced a Senate resolution which articulated the applicable principles of international law, and then concluded with this clause.  
Resolve . . . , that it is the sense of the Senate that the President should confer with Kuwait and other member nations of the coalition of the United Nations to establish an international criminal court or an international military tribunal to try and punish all individuals involved in the planning or execution of the above-referenced crimes including Saddam Hussein. 
Had we pursued that course of action at that time we would very likely--almost certainly, in fact--be in a different position today. 
Since my resolution was offered, and this is an ongoing effort which I have made, along with Congressman Jim Leach in the House, and Senator Christopher Dodd here in the Senate, a War Crimes Tribunal has been established by U.N. Security Council Resolution 808 on February 22, 1993, establishing an international tribunal to try individuals accused of international war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, and Resolution 955 adopted on November 8, 1994, to establish a similar war crimes tribunal for Rwanda. By extending the jurisdiction to Iraq, the War Crimes Tribunal could prosecute 
Saddam Hussein. 
There is an abundance of evidence which would warrant the conviction of Saddam Hussein and the imposition of the death penalty. While the U.N. resolutions on the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda do not provide for the death penalty, the United Nations may well be persuaded that Saddam Hussein's conduct warrants the death penalty. I believe the evidence speaks loudly to that effect. Beyond his war of aggression against Kuwait and his missile attacks killing U.S. personnel in Saudi Arabia and Israelis in Tel Aviv, there is powerful evidence of Saddam Hussein's systematic action to destroy the population of civilian Kurds in Iraq through the use of chemical weapons in 1997-1998, with more than 182,000 missing persons and the destruction of more than 4,000 villages, including the placement of more than 10 million land mines in Iraq's Kurdistan and ethnic cleansing in the city of Kurkuk. 
Those international crimes certainly warrant the death penalty by all existing standards. With an international judicial determination that the death penalty should be imposed on Saddam Hussein, we would then have the high moral ground to carry out that verdict. 
The removal of Saddam Hussein as Iraq's President does pose questions as to who would take over and what would happen to Iraq's ability to counterbalance Iran in that region. It is hard to imagine an international situation worse than the one currently posed by Saddam Hussein, and it is hard to imagine a new Iraqi leader worse than Saddam Hussein. It may well be that a covert action or covert actions might succeed in deposing Saddam Hussein. That was the subject of an op-ed piece in the New York Times yesterday by former CIA Director John Deutch. The Voice of America could be intensified giving encouragement to his many enemies in Iraq. An alternative government could be established with those dissident forces. And, a no-fly zone could be established over all of Iraq. A naval blockade could further tighten the noose and perhaps bring Saddam Hussein to his knees. These and other proposals could lead to his removal without targeting him. 
As a generalization, our national policy is sound, not to kill a foreign leader for political purposes. But it is important to note that that prohibition is mandated only by a Presidential Executive order. It does not have the force of law of congressional enactment. 
Let me now pursue a series of questions relating to that policy. 
First, should that policy be applied to Saddam Hussein after he attempted to assassinate former President George Bush? 
Second, should that policy be applied to Saddam Hussein, considering his atrocious record of war crimes, or at least after he is convicted and sentenced to death? 
Three, would targeting Saddam Hussein constitute a lesser use of force and a more justifiable use of force than the President's contemplated air and missile strikes? 
Fourth, is it time to reexamine that policy as it applies to the likes of Saddam Hussein? 
Fifth, is it sensible to tie our own hands for self-defense by such a Presidential Executive order when Saddam Hussein amasses weapons of mass destruction which threaten the United States and the whole world with horrible consequences? 
Sixth, if we are justified in preemptive air and missile strikes, which will inevitably kill Iraqi civilians, why are we not justified in preemptive actions against Saddam Hussein who is a mass murderer and a certified international war criminal? 
Mr. President, it is a rapidly changing world scene. It is time to consider those questions. 
I have no doubt about two propositions. First, a trial of Saddam Hussein as an international war criminal would be preeminently just. Second, solving the international threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction mandates removing Saddam Hussein as Iraq's leader. Perhaps Saddam Hussein could be replaced by the people of Iraq with additional U.N. sanctions, a stronger Voice of America, and nonlethal covert action. If not, then we may have to change our answers to those six questions, just as Saddam Hussein has changed the world with his weapons of mass destruction.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Mr. Craig A. Higgins, Clerk of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, recently announced that he will soon be joining the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health as its Senior Advisor for Legislative Affairs. I offer him, on behalf of all my Senate colleagues, our goodwill and best wishes as he assumes his new duties and responsibilities at NIH. 
Mr. Higgins has served with loyalty and with distinction in the United States Senate for nearly 18 years. He has worked for Senator Mark O. Hatfield as a legislative assistant from 1980 to 1987. He then joined the subcommittee staff, becoming Clerk of the subcommittee in 1995. He is well known to be a dedicated and conscientious staff member who, like many staff members, has spent countless hours of energy, time, and effort in producing bills, reports, and hearings. During his stewardship of our subcommittee, Craig has continued the tradition of bipartisanship in the formulation of this very important bill. He understands the many needs of the American people and sought constructive solutions to better enable our government to address those needs. He devoted considerable time helping individual constituents and informing the public about the work of the subcommittee. 
Craig has earned the respect of the leadership of these agencies and of the Members and staff of the Senate by being fair, responsive, and helpful. Both Democrats and Republicans have trusted his advice and counsel as our subcommittee confronted the many issues. 
In his new position at NIH, Craig will no doubt continue his outstanding work in advancing the promise of genome research. With his professionalism and legislative experience, he brings to the task exceptional talent and energy, and I have the highest degree of confidence that his ability and dedication will continue his remarkable record of excellence. 
I would take this opportunity again to thank Craig for his service to our subcommittee. As a devoted father to his children, Keith and Kristin, and husband to his wife, Wendy, Craig, like the many other parents in our workforce, has balanced home life with career. In many ways, his work in the Senate is motivated in large part in securing a stronger future for all families, including his own. I join my Senate colleagues in wishing Craig well and we expect for him to continue the highest traditions of excellence at his new post at the National Human Genome Research Institute.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition, and as the final speaker before we adjourn for a recess, I am going to comment about the situation in Iraq. 
It had been my hope that the Congress might have addressed this issue. But it is obvious now that we will not. I think that the Congress--at least the Senate--is not addressing the issue because there is not clear-cut agreement in this body as to how to proceed. 
My own view is that an air attack and a missile attack, if one is to be carried out, constitutes an act of war. And under the Constitution that requires Congressional authorization. The President is authorized as the Commander in Chief--and there is only one Commander in Chief, and it is obvious that where the 535 Members of the Congress cannot agree upon a program that we are not committed to be the executive. That is why we have an executive. But still the Constitution requires that war would be declared only by an act of Congress. And I think the international law interpretations make it plain that military action, like air attack or missile attack, does constitute an act of war. 
I believe that we have not yet seen a clear definition of U.S. objectives as to what we are seeking to accomplish. My sense is that the American people are not prepared for what may occur. 
I make it a practice, as I know the Chair does, of having open house town meetings. And I had three this week--on Monday in Cumberland County, Lebanon County, and Lancaster County, PA. There is great concern among my constituents--those whom I have talked to there and other places--of not having an idea as to precisely what we are going to accomplish. 
It is my hope, if action is to be taken, that before any action is taken the President of the United States will address the American people and will identify the goals as he sees them and evaluate our likelihood of attaining those goals so that the people of the United States will be prepared and understand what is going to happen. But I do not see at this date how there can be public support for an attack in the absence of informing the American people, preparing them and having a public dialog on the subject. The Congress is speaking loudly by not speaking at all on a resolution to authorize the use of force against Iraq. 
In 1991, on January 10, this body authorized the use of force. I was at the forefront arguing that force should be used at that time. We had an extended debate. The Congress--the Senate specifically--was complimented for having a classic debate on what our vital national interests were and how we should respond. I do believe that we have a vital national interest in what is going on in Iraq at the present time. I do believe that there are great dangers posed by Saddam Hussein and by his weapons of mass destruction. 
I had an opportunity back in January of 1990--just 8 years ago on a trip with Senator Richard Shelby--to talk to Saddam Hussein. It is not an easy matter to deal with Saddam Hussein, as we have seen. There is some talk that Saddam Hussein ought to be toppled. But the air attacks, the missiles, and the planes will not accomplish that. It is plain at this juncture that there is no positioning of the kind of ground forces necessary to topple Saddam Hussein. Even as to the air attacks, it is plain that we will not destroy all of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. 
The question is: How will Saddam Hussein come out of whatever military force we use? I am very much concerned that he may come out a martyr. Certainly the lack of support for the United States raises major questions as to how the rest of the world views this issue. 
On my travels--and I have traveled extensively, Mr. President, in my capacity as Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the 104th Congress, and my work on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee--I have found that there is great admiration for the United States around the world. People all over the globe admire our economic achievements. They admire our values. They admire our freedom, and the success of our free enterprise system. 
But there is also a touch of concern about abuse of power or excessive use of power, perhaps arrogance. And, we have to evaluate that very carefully in what we do as to Iraq. 
I made a trip to the Mideast from late December to mid-January, and wherever I went I heard concerns about the projection of American power and concerns about the Iraqi civilian population, not Saddam Hussein, but concern about the Iraqi civilian population. It is an odd quirk of history that after the great success of the United States, the coalition put together by President Bush, which was a masterful job, President Bush is in Houston and Saddam is still in Baghdad running Iraq. 
I have spoken with some frequency on the question of greater personal Presidential involvement in international dispute resolution, a subject that I have discussed personally with the President. It is my view that President Clinton can leave the Department of Agriculture to Secretary Glickman and the Department of the Interior to Secretary Babbitt, and so forth, but only the President of the United States can wield the enormous power that comes from the Presidency. 
In 1995, Senator Brown and I spoke to Prime Minister Gowda of India, who said to us that he hoped the subcontinent could become nuclear free. The next day we passed that information on to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, who asked us if we had it in writing. We told her, of course, we did not. But we asked her when she had last talked to the Prime Minister of India. She said, `We don't talk.' 
That night Senator Brown and I cabled President Clinton with those views fresh in our mind, urging the President to call those Prime Ministers to the Oval Office; nobody turns down an invitation to the Oval Office. And later talking to the President, he said, well, I intend to do that after I am re-elected. I have talked to him since, and it has not yet happened. 
I think the President did an outstanding job, and I compliment him on the negotiations in the Mideast in the 1995 timeframe where the President and the Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, almost brokered an agreement between Syria and Israel. When I met with the President in mid-December before my trip to the Mideast, I urged him to become active again on that track of the peace process because I think the parties are very close. 
I had a chance to talk to Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Assad in August-November of 1996, and they were pretty far apart. Prime Minister Netanyahu said that he wanted to resume peace negotiations but he had a new mandate, he wanted to start fresh. President Assad of Syria said that he would want to start negotiations but would want to pick up where he, or Syria, and Prime Minister Rabin left off before Prime Minister Rabin's assassination in November of 1995. In talking to them last month the words were about the same but the music was different. 
I think that Presidential involvement there might find success, especially with the explicit condition that any agreement would be subject to ratification by the Israeli electorate on the Golan Heights, something about which only Israel could make a decision for themselves considering all the security factors, and the issue with the Palestinians much more difficult, the Israel-Palestine crack. But here I think personal Presidential involvement might be very successful. I think there has been the absence of that, where we find ourselves with only Great Britain at our side now as we look to action against Iraq. I have heard what the Secretary of Defense has had to say, and I have total respect and confidence in Secretary Cohen based on the 16 years that I worked with him in the Senate. But he alone cannot carry the Executive burden in this matter. 
On the information at hand, we do not have the cooperation of others in a military attack. I think that has to be weighed very carefully. I do think that there are alternatives. I do think that the issue of a blockade is something that might bring Saddam Hussein, if not to his knees, to a greater economic impasse. It would be my hope that before action is taken which constitutes an 
act of war, the issue would be debated by the Senate and by the House of Representatives and an appropriate resolution would be put before us to have the appropriate constitutional authorization. 
I know that many of our colleagues have spoken on this matter in the course of the last several days, and as the last speaker in the Senate before we go to adjournment, I did want to make these comments for whatever consideration the President and the Executive may choose to make of them.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I did not have an opportunity yesterday after the Majority Leader announced the resolution of the proceedings as to the pending nomination of Judge Massiah-Jackson for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. I sought recognition to speak with unanimous consent for up to 1 minute, and there was an objection levied so I was not able to talk at that time. 
I cannot limit my remarks to a single minute today because there are other things to be commented upon, but I believe that the referral of this matter to the Judiciary Committee is the appropriate course of conduct. Notwithstanding my continuing efforts to set forth the facts, my own personal activities have been grossly inaccurately reported. 
First, it is President Clinton who has recommended Judge Massiah-Jackson for the Federal court. That is the President's nomination. It is not my nomination or the nomination of Senator Santorum. It is true that Massiah-Jackson was cleared by a nonpartisan panel appointed by Senator Santorum and me, but that approval does not involve any personal activity or action by either of the Senators. 
Second, in my capacity as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and since Judge Massiah-Jackson is a constituent, I have vigorously sought to see that she received fair treatment, just as I did when the Judiciary Committee considered the nomination of Justice Clarence Thomas. 
Third, I have made a public commitment to review all the matters submitted by her opponents before casting my vote on the Senate floor. 
Fourth, I have been proactive in seeking all the facts against her confirmation as well as all of the facts of those who support her. 
The charge has been made that I made a `deal' with the White House to appoint Judge Massiah-Jackson in exchange for the appointment of Judge Bruce Kauffman, who was sworn into the United States District Court on January 20. The facts are that I am party to an arrangement for Republicans to receive one nomination for the district courts for every three Democrats who are nominated, an arrangement identical with that now applicable to the State of New York. But I am not under any obligation to support any specific nominee, nor anybody submitted by the White House from the Democratic ranks. I am not under any obligation to support anyone, including Judge Massiah-Jackson, if I conclude the person is not qualified. 
When Judge Massiah-Jackson's nomination was announced by the President on July 31, 1997, there were rumors of opposition, and in order to try to find out what the facts were in opposition, Senator Santorum, Senator Biden and I held a hearing in Philadelphia on October 3. All of the witnesses who testified favored Judge Massiah-Jackson, including five of her colleagues from the Common Pleas bench. 
Mayor Rendell, who had been district attorney for 3 of her 7 years on the criminal bench, was enthusiastically in support of her nomination. Then the Judiciary Committee held its formal hearing on October 29, and again no witnesses opposed her. Senator Kyl, Senator Sessions and I questioned her closely on her record, and on November 6 she was reported out of the Committee by a vote of 12 to 6. 
Thereafter, when district attorneys from Pennsylvania raised objections, Senator Santorum and I took a proactive position to meet those district attorneys, and we heard them out on January 23. I then arranged to get all of their opposing cases by January 30, with an opportunity for Judge Massiah-Jackson to respond, and that is what we await at the present time. As a matter of fundamental fairness, she is entitled to that hearing. 
So, I think the Senate has taken the appropriate stand to have the hearing, and those who object will hear what Judge Massiah-Jackson has to say and then I, as a juror, along with my colleagues, will take a look at all of the facts and make a decision as to whether she is to be confirmed or whether she should be rejected. I thank the Chair for the courtesy and I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, this may be a good time for me to report briefly on the travels that I undertook from December 30 to January 13, when I visited the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague and found that this agency is moving forward with prosecutions on war crimes against humanity, arising out of the activities in Bosnia. 
It is my sense that after the first conviction, which has been obtained, the tribunal is on its way to establishing a very, very important international precedent. For the past decade-plus, many of us, including Senator Dodd, Congressman Jim Leach, myself, and others, have been working to try to bring an international criminal court into existence. It is my sense that if the War Crimes Tribunal is successful, we may have the most important institutional change in international relations in this century, if we can bring the rule of law into the international arena. 
I think it is very important that the outstanding indictments be served. In talking to the military leaders and NATO in Bosnia, I have been informed that we have the capacity to do so if the instructions are given. Up until the present time, the rule has been to serve them with warrants of arrest if our military groups come into contact with those under indictment, but they are not to make an effort to search them out. It is a delicate matter and has to be handled with discretion and with regard to not losing lives in the process of making the arrests. But, I think that ultimately those warrants of arrest do have to be served. 
We stopped in Bosnia and saw the activities there. Mindful of the President's recent request for an open-ended stay in Bosnia, we discussed with the military leaders and with some of the soldiers their sense as to what was going to happen there. 
The Congress has legislated to bring an end to the funding as of June 30, 1998, with certain exceptions relating to a Presidential extension. But, it seems to me that it is necessary to have some idea as to how long we are going to be there. Those enmities and hatreds go back hundreds of years, and it is necessary, in my judgment, for us to have some idea as to how long we are going to stay there and how long it will take to accomplish that mission if we are, in fact, to remain there.

Earnest Smith, January term, 1986, 0144-0146 that Judge Massiah-Jackson was reversed for handing out a sentence which was too tough or long under the sentencing guidelines? I would be interested to know if the Senator knew as opposed to the staff knowing, if it please.

Mr. SPECTER. I raise those two points on specific matters cited by the distinguished chairman because there is a great deal which has to be analyzed. I am in total agreement with Senator Hatch when he says that there has to be review in a bipartisan manner to take a close look at Judge Massiah-Jackson's qualifications. I consider myself as a juror on the matter to look at the facts and make an impartial, unbiased determination. That is the conclusion which I came to in conjunction with my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, when we had the district attorneys in my office on January 23rd at the invitation of Senator Santorum and myself to hear the specifics of their complaints. They said at that time that they had some 50 cases to present on Judge Massiah-Jackson's record, and we responded that we wanted to hear them to see what they were. We hoped that they could be filed within a week, although whatever information they give us at any time, including today, is going to be considered. 
This is a very important matter when you have a lifetime Federal court appointment. In fact, 49 cases were submitted on Monday, February 2nd, a week ago yesterday. Those cases are currently under review. I am told that some 15 people are reviewing the cases in the Department of Justice and at the White House to make an analysis of those cases. Judge Massiah-Jackson is now in the process of reviewing those matters to present her views as to why she did what she did in those cases. Once that is concluded, I think that we would have to make an analysis. And the 
probabilities are high that another hearing will be required, although even that cannot be determined until we take a look at the cases to see what those cases say. 
When Senator Hatch outlined the history of this matter, he pointed out that the President submitted the nomination of Judge Massiah-Jackson to the Senate on July 31st of 1997, and that the papers were sent over on August 15th of 1997. 
I think it is worth noting, Mr. President, that an arrangement which has been worked out between Senator Santorum and myself as the Senators from Pennsylvania and the White House has been that for every three nominees submitted by the President's party, Senator Santorum and I would be able to make recommendations as to one judge from the Republican Party. Pennsylvania is the only State which has that arrangement, with the exception of New York which has had that arrangement going back to the 1970's when Senator Javits was the Senator from New York. Our recommendation was for the Eastern District and for former Pennsylvania State Supreme Court Justice Bruce Kauffman and that was our suggestion. There was no connection with any other nominee. But that arrangement has been carried out, and we expect it to be carried out in the Western District and the Middle District as well. 
As Senator Hatch pointed out, when we sought to have information about Judge Massiah-Jackson, none was forthcoming, and there was a reluctance on the part of the Judiciary Committee until further investigation was done. 
So Senator Santorum and I convened a hearing which was attended by Senator Biden, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in Philadelphia in early October. We asked all parties to come forward at that time, if they had any information adverse to Judge Massiah-Jackson. Among the witnesses who testified that day, one was a representative of the mayor. And Mayor Rendell has been very forceful in his support of Judge Massiah-Jackson. Mayor Rendell told me that Judge Massiah-Jackson had only one appeal taken and had been sustained on that. Senator Hatch pointed out that apparently is not the case with two other cases having been reviewed here. Mayor Rendell had been District Attorney in Philadelphia, and had subsequently been the Mayor of Philadelphia, been the interim District Attorney until 1985, and then elected Mayor in 1991. So he had some substantial familiarity with Judge Massiah-Jackson's record and was very forceful in his support of Judge Massiah-Jackson. 
In any event, after the hearing in Philadelphia in early October, the Judiciary Committee hearing was scheduled in late October. And at that time there was a review of Judge Massiah-Jackson's record at that time. Senator Kyl presided. Senator Sessions was present, and I was present. Others were present when we went into her record. Subsequent to that hearing, information has come forward from the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association challenging Judge Massiah-Jackson on a variety of grounds. 
When I heard about that, I asked them to come in. January 19 was an inconvenient date, but we did meet on January 23 and then the sequence followed with their having presented their cases which we have in hand as of a week ago yesterday, February 2. 
It seems to me that what we need to do is to take a look at those cases. There have been citations against Judge Massiah-Jackson in some cases--and I am not going to go into them at this time--where Judge Massiah-Jackson's judgments were later upheld by the appellate court. The information which has been provided to me is that in 95 cases which were taken on appeal from Judge Massiah-Jackson, she was reversed in 14 cases. Some of those cases were civil as well as criminal. And I think it important to note that Judge Massiah-Jackson has not sat in criminal cases since 1991. 
I think there is agreement by all people who have taken a look at this nomination that a lifetime appointment is a matter of great concern, and I might add that there is a special concern among the district attorneys which has been expressed to me as the result of the decision by Judge Dalzell of the same court, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in a case of Commonwealth v. Lambert in Lancaster County, a very serious homicide matter where Judge Dalzell suppressed evidence and said there could not be a retrial. Judge Dalzell has since been reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit because the defendant did not exhaust State remedies, and Congressman Pitts and Congressman Gekas and I have filed legislation which would deny jurisdiction to a Federal judge to order no retrial. Federal judges have the authority to suppress evidence, but I do not think they have the authority to deny retrial. That is a matter for the District Attorney of Lancaster County, something I have some familiarity with, having been DA for 8 years and Assistant District Attorney for 4 years before that. But I think a retrial is a matter for the local District Attorney and the local court. But there is quite a concern among the District Attorneys of Pennsylvania about that action by a Federal judge and a concern as to this nomination, and as citizens, as District Attorneys, they obviously have every right to provide information to the Judiciary Committee on this nominee. I think we have to consider what they have to say. I think we have to consider Judge Massiah-Jackson's responses and then make a determination of the judgment as to whether she should be confirmed or not. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, let me take strong offense to what the Senator from Missouri has said in a number of particulars, if I could have his attention. If I could have the attention of the Senator from Missouri. When he makes a comment about betraying the oath of office, I consider that insulting. I have been in this body a little longer than the Senator from Missouri has, and I know what my oath of office is. If the Senator from Missouri thinks that he knows enough, that can be his conclusion. He may be willing to make a judgment without hearing from Judge Massiah-Jackson, but I don't think that is the fair or the appropriate thing to do. 
When he talks about why send it back to the Committee, let's debate and decide this in the light of day, he is not only insulting this Senator, he is insulting the Committee--why send it back to the Committee without the scrutiny of the public? If the matter goes back to the Committee, there will be an open hearing, and the Senator from Missouri is on the Committee, although he wasn't present when Judge Massiah-Jackson's hearing came up. The Senator from Missouri has made a good political speech, but I don't think a speech becoming of the United States 
Senate's decision to hear both sides of the case. 
When the Senator from Missouri says that there has been offensive language, that is true, and that was taken up with the Committee and the Committee voted 12 to 6 to report Judge Massiah-Jackson out, notwithstanding that language which was, in fact, offensive, and she apologized for it. I don't know of any Senator on this floor or in this body--maybe there is one, the Senator from Missouri--who has never made offensive comments. But I don't think you would find people in many offices, if any, who would be disqualified from office because they made two offensive comments.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when I make that comment about the Senator from Missouri saying that he knows the facts, knows the case, he raises four points, and one of them is the rape of this young man, a victim, but he doesn't know that the defendant was acquitted. That does have some bearing. If the scrutiny and the thoroughness of the Senator from Missouri on the balance of the record is as thorough as it was on this case, some may question the basis for his judgments, wanting to come to a vote without having heard the other side of the case. 
When the Senator from Missouri comments about endangering police officers, I wonder if the Senator from Missouri knows that those officers were identified because they testified in open court? 
And when the Senator from Missouri talks about attending the funerals of seven police officers, this Senator has attended the funerals of a lot more police officers than seven in 4 years as an Assistant District Attorney and 8 years as District Attorney of Philadelphia. It may be in that capacity that I have some greater knowledge of criminal procedure in that city and what goes on in the courtroom and what happens and whether somebody is entitled to make a reply. Not only attended the funerals of seven police officers, but prosecuted on many occasions their murderers. 
When the Senator from Missouri makes a comment about lower sentences, lesser included offenses, he may have a point on that, but that requires an analysis of what was in the case. 
I agree with the Senator from Missouri when he talks about the need for a quality evaluation of judges, and I do not believe that we ought to appoint judges for the Federal courts for lifetime appointments without very thorough scrutiny, but I do not think that it advances the cause to vilify or joke about the American Bar Association and the `Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.' The Philadelphia Bar Association is making an analysis and stands behind Judge Massiah-Jackson as her advocate. 
When the Senator from Missouri says that Arlen Specter is the sponsoring Senator, again, he doesn't know what he is talking about. This is a nominee by the President. This is a nominee by the President, and I have said that Judge Massiah-Jackson is entitled to a fair hearing and to have her side of the matter presented. That is, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, as a United States Senator and as a juror, who has to make a decision. 
I am well aware of my oath of office. And I am well aware of my responsibilities to make an impartial judgment in this case. I said to the district attorneys who came to my office on January 23--and I repeated it earlier today--that I was interested in hearing what they had to say, but I will not make a judgment until I hear the reply of Judge Massiah-Jackson as a matter of basic fundamental fairness. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, let me congratulate the Senator from Alabama for his professional discussion of today, and I think

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from Alabama voted against Judge Massiah-Jackson at the committee level and had raised questions about Judge Massiah-Jackson so that he felt those questions were sufficient at that time for him to make his judgment. I respect his judgment. He has raised quite a number of additional questions today. And when he cites these cases about making a finding of a lesser included offense, he accurately states the law that those matters are not reviewable, that is the conclusion of the case. 
On a number of other matters which he has raised, those matters are reviewable; that where Judge Massiah-Jackson has made the decision to suppress evidence, that is a reviewable matter. So when she makes that judgment, her decision can be overturned. And where she made the judgment to order a nolle pros of a case, that was subject to review as well. 
When the Senator from Alabama was present at the hearing, we discussed a number of those cases. We have both been prosecutors. We know the evidentiary rules, and some matters may be reviewed. Judge Massiah-Jackson made quite a number of judgments which were subject to review, and on a good many of them she was upheld. 
When the Senator from Alabama raises questions about what the police community has stated, I understand that and respect that. 
We received one letter from the Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police citing a case where Judge Massiah-Jackson did some things that they write to disagree with. On that particular case, it went for appellate review, and the Appellate Court of Pennsylvania upheld Judge Massiah-Jackson. So the issue would be that these police officers and police officials will have an opportunity to testify about the specifics as to their judgment or whether their judgment might differ if they knew what had happened on appeal in the case. 
When the Senator from Alabama talks about `why will the judge identify police officers in court,' that is the case referred to by Senator Hatch earlier where those officers have already testified in court. 
In raising questions about why Judge Massiah-Jackson would take action in a variety of contexts, I think those are fair and appropriate questions. I think those questions are appropriate for Judge Massiah-Jackson to have an opportunity in which to respond. To the credit of the Senator from Alabama, when we had the hearing, he was there and he was asking those questions. 
I think it is not irrelevant to comment that there have been a number of convictions of police officers in the Federal court in Philadelphia recently for falsifying evidence in drug cases. Several hundred cases have been dismissed by the District Attorney of Philadelphia. The city of Philadelphia has paid out some $11 million in damages where you deal in a certain context and certain sections of a big city like Philadelphia. It may differ from some other communities. I came to Philadelphia from Russell, KS, and the differences were absolutely gigantic. 
When I was District Attorney in Philadelphia for 8 years after being assistant DA for some 4 years, I had many very strong disagreements with the judges. In one case, I was held in contempt of court in my battle on a sentence on a narcotics case, Commonwealth v. Arnold Marks. I still remember it. It only happened 28 years ago--4 ounces of pure, uncut heroin. And I thought the sentence was insufficient. I battled with the judge. 
The judges in Philadelphia when I became DA used to come to court late and leave early. I sent my detectives into court to write down the time they arrived and the time they left for lunch and the time they got back and the time they quit. Very frequently, court was supposed to run 10 to 12:30 and 2 to 4--4 1/2 hours on the bench, not a straining schedule. But they had jobs to do in chambers. But the common practice was to arrive a few minutes before 11, work to about 12:10, come back at 2:50 and leave about 3:20. So I sent detectives in to court to write down the times. 
Soon thereafter, one of my detectives was held in contempt. I went down to the court. I said to the judge, `You can't hold him in contempt. I did the order.' I was the District Attorney. `If you are going to hold anybody in contempt, you have to hold me in contempt. You can't hold me in contempt because anybody can come in open court and write down the times you come and go.' 
Later, I got the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania to issue an order that judges had to sit from 9:30 to 5. We petitioned for reconsideration of sentences. 
This business about battling with the judge is something a District Attorney has to do. That is the appropriate role of a public prosecutor. When the District Attorneys have raised questions, I think that is within their rights. The police officers have raised questions. I think that is within their rights. 
But let's hear what Judge Massiah-Jackson has to say. The Senator from Alabama raised a number of questions. He can't understand why a judge would do that. And it is a little different milieu. Let us hear what she has to say. When we have all the facts, I consider myself, as I said earlier, a juror. I have taken an oath as a U.S. Senator and as a juror. I am prepared to hear both sides and to make a judgment. I think the hearings will be held in the light of day. There will be full disclosure. There is ample opportunity for public scrutiny, as there should be, and we will make the determination on the facts and on the merits as to whether this nominee should or should not be confirmed. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today for the purpose of submitting a resolution calling for the Budget Committee to add $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, and I do so because of the unanimous view expressed by the Senate last year on a resolution that NIH funding should be doubled over the course of the 5 years following the date of the introduction of the resolution by our distinguished colleague, Senator Mack. That resolution was introduced on January 22, 1997. Regrettably, even though that resolution was passed 98 to nothing, when the budget resolution was returned, the appropriate health account has a reduction of $100 million. So that even though the Senate had spoken on its intent to see NIH funding raised, doubling over 5 years, and that was from a figure of about $13 billion, the funds simply were not there. That led to the introduction of an amendment to the budget resolution by Senator Harkin and myself, Senator Harkin being my distinguished colleague and ranking member of the subcommittee which I chair on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education. And we sought to add in $1.1 billion to carry out the expressed sense of the Senate. That was defeated 63 to 37. So that, while the Senate had expressed its druthers on a resolution, when it came to the dollars they simply were not there. 
Senator Harkin and I then went to work with our subcommittee and we were able, by making economies and establishing priorities, to add $952 million to the NIH account for an increase of 7.5 percent. After the conference we did increase the figure by some $907 million, so that now the National Institutes of Health has $13,647,843,000. And the National Institutes of Health, I suggest to my colleagues, and the country--anybody who is watching on C-SPAN2--is the crown jewel of the Federal Government. The funding has been increased steadily during my tenure in the Senate, regardless of who was chairing the subcommittee. Although the budgets were always high, frequently had cuts called for by the administration, when the chairman was Senator Weicker, when the chairman was Lawton Chiles, when the chairman was Tom Harkin, or more recently under my chairmanship, we have increased the funding tremendously. And the National Institutes of Health has responded with really extraordinary advances in research identifying genes. Now the work has to be pushed forward to see exactly what can be accomplished in the next century. 
The President said on Tuesday night that someone born today would have a good chance of living into the 22nd century, 100 years. I think that is a possibility. But only if we maintain the phenomenal advances of the NIH. 
I personally have been the beneficiary of the tremendous advances of the National Institutes of Health. Two decades ago there was no such thing as an MRI. That device detected a problem for me. And other advances led to good results for me. I know millions of people have benefited from the research and the investment which we have made in the National Institutes of Health. But that takes money, and that is why this resolution is being offered by Senator Harkin, Senator Frist, Senator Reid, Senator Snowe and myself, to call upon the Budget Committee to add in $2 billion so we can carry forward the important work of the National Institutes of Health. 
Last year I attended the dedication of a building named in honor of Senator Hatfield, who has been a tremendous leader on NIH, and many other items, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee for many years. When I was there, I talked to Dr. Varmus, who is the head of NIH. I said, `Dr. Varmus, what would it really take?' As I asked Dr. Klausner, who heads the cancer research, `Tell us what you can really appropriately use?' Because many grant applications are turned down. He said, `Well, Senator, I can't really tell you that because we have to file the wish list with the Office of Management and Budget.' He didn't quite put it that way. But there are limitations. 
I said to Dr. Varmus, `This year the Senate is going to want to know in an unvarnished form what you really think could be appropriately used for the National Institutes of Health.' Then I made a comment that we still have the subpoena power, to really find out what it would take. And I suspect that it is a very large figure. But when you have a Federal budget of $1.7 trillion, I believe it is possible to establish priorities to make NIH a top priority. 
In the last few years, Senator Harkin and I have consolidated and eliminated 135 programs to enable us to save $1.5 billion. It's pretty hard to eliminate a program in Washington, DC, but we have been able to do that. With that $1.5 billion we have allocated those funds to NIH, guaranteed student loans, and many, many other important projects. 
So, with those brief comments I send this resolution to the desk. I ask it be held at the desk. I ask my colleagues who are listening on C-SPAN2, or their staffs, to take a look at the resolution because I would like to see cosponsors. I think we ought to have the 98 who voted last year for the resolution which I cosponsored with Senator Mack, and perhaps the two absentees as well.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to join my colleagues in introducing the `Caring for Children Act,' which will ease the financial burden of child care for American families--for those parents who work, and for those who choose to stay home to raise their children for a period of time. The sponsors of this legislation recognize the importance of affordable quality child care to the successful development of our children. 
Our bill would expand the Dependent Care tax credit to make it more accessible to families who need it, double the authorization for the Child Care Development Block Grant, and provide grants to small businesses to create or enhance child care facilities for their employees. This bill also includes provisions from the proposal I introduced last year with my colleague, Congressman Jon Fox, `The Affordable Child Care Act,' which provides a tax credit for employers who provide on-site or site-adjacent child care to their employees in order to reduce the child care expenses of the employee. 
Not all families choose the same option for child care. Many families rely on relatives, centers operated by churches and other religious organizations, centers at or near their workplace, or make other arrangements to provide care for their children while they work. In light of the diverse needs for child care in America, this bill represents a good start toward expanding the choices for American parents. And, any such legislation must recognize that there is a need to provide some relief to families where one parent stays at home. 
The need for affordable and accessible day care is critical given the increasing numbers of working parents and dual-income families in the United States. According to the Bureau of the Census, in 1975, 31 percent of married mothers with a child younger than age one participated in the labor force. By 1995, that figure had risen to 59 percent. Almost 64 percent of married mothers and 53 percent of single mothers with children younger than age six participated in the labor force in 1995. 
The cost of child care for families is also significant. Licensed day care centers in some urban areas cost as much as $200 per week, and the disparity in costs and availability of child care between urban and rural grows greater every day. For families which need or choose to have both parents work outside the home, the burden of making child care decisions is great. These figures serve to underscore the need for action on the part of the Federal government to provide the necessary assistance to our nation's working families. 
As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I am pleased that this legislation would build on an existing federal child care program by authorizing an additional $5 billion over five years to the Child Care Development Block Grant program, bringing total spending for this program to $2.5 billion annually by FY2002. The CCDBG program which works well in assisting low-income families acquire child care and helped over 93,000 Pennsylvania families last year. By increasing the authorization, we can help even more families without creating a new entitlement program. 
Our legislation will also require States to create and enforce safety and health standards in child care facilities, and provide money for the Department of Health and Human Services to disseminate information to parents and providers about quality child care, through brochures, toll-free hotlines, the Internet, and other technological assistance. 
The `Caring for Children Act' complements my recent efforts to assist working families in the context of welfare reform and children's health insurance. When Congress debated welfare reform in 1995 and 1996, I worked to ensure that adequate funds were provided for child care, a critical component for welfare mothers who would be required to work to receive new limited welfare benefits. I am pleased that the welfare reform bill that became law provides $20 billion in child care funding over a six year period. Similarly, I was pleased to participate in the bipartisan effort in 1997 to enact legislation to provide $24 billion over the next five years for States to establish or broaden children's health insurance programs. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe that it is critical that the 105th Congress not adjourn without enacting legislation to assist families in their ability to afford safe, quality child care for their children, either at home with a parent or another arrangement. Our legislation will provide peace of mind to millions of American families struggling to balance career and child raising. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation, and I urge its swift adoption.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on statements made earlier today by Senator Leahy concerning Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. Senator Leahy has challenged Mr. Starr on a number of items, matters of very substantial concern. 
I telephoned Mr. Starr to find out what the facts were. Both Senator Leahy and I are on the Judiciary Committee, which has oversight over the Department of Justice and also the independent counsel. Senator Leahy began his presentation by noting that he had spent nearly a decade as a prosecutor, and I have a similar background, actually a little longer than a decade, but about the same. Senator Leahy then commented about his concern about law enforcement being nonpartisan and nonideological, and on the facts. I most certainly agree with Senator Leahy on his assertions to that extent. Then Senator Leahy proceeded to criticize Mr. Starr for conducting a partisan investigation, for making leaks to the press, by coordinating the investigation with what is going on in the civil case involving Ms. Paula Jones, and charging that there was a sting operation to engage the President of the United States in secretly recorded conversations. All of these are obviously very serious accusations. 
Mr. President, it seems to me that the current controversy involving the President and Ms. Monica Lewinsky is something that ought to be put behind the country at the earliest possible time. I made public statements last week when the President was questioned about this matter, while Chairman Arafat was in his office, and said that I thought it inappropriate to have that question and bad practice for the President to respond to that question, and made public statements last week and over the weekend about what I consider to be an unwise media frenzy on this matter--that we all ought to wait and see what the facts are before coming to any conclusions, and in the interim the President ought to be permitted to carry out his duties because they are very, very important duties. 
I agree with what Senator Leahy said when he recited the issues of foreign policy, Iraq, the State of the Union, and the matters which the President has to deal with. 
There have been many reports in the press about what Mr. Starr did and how he got into this investigation and whether his activities were an inappropriate extension of what he had been authorized to do prior to the time he took his first steps on this matter involving Ms. Monica Lewinsky. Mr. Starr told me this afternoon in a telephone conversation that he did engage in a consensual monitoring in the eastern district of Virginia on a conversation with Ms. Linda Tripp and Ms. Monica Lewinsky. It was a consensual monitoring because it was consented to by Ms. Linda Tripp. Mr. Starr told me that Ms. Linda Tripp had been a witness on independent counsel matters in the past involving the White House Travel Office and Mr. Foster, and that the consensual monitoring was undertaken to corroborate what Ms. Linda Tripp had told Mr. Starr independently. 
Mr. Starr said it was an appropriate exercise of his existing jurisdiction because in his investigation involving Mr. Webster Hubble, Mr. Hubble's situation involved a matter where an individual was involved in providing job arrangements for Mr. Hubble outside the District of Columbia with a certain prospective employer. Mr. Starr said that the same person was involved in providing a job opportunity for Ms. Monica Lewinsky outside the District of Columbia with the same prospective employer and that this connection was sufficient for Mr. Starr to proceed with this consensual monitoring, which Mr. Starr pointed out was done professionally by the FBI and, as Mr. Starr described it, in a completely appropriate manner. Mr. Starr advised that he then took this matter to the Department of Justice after he had completed the 
consensual monitoring. 
Mr. President, I will not become involved here in what the factual allegations are, what Ms. Tripp said or what Ms. Lewinsky said, because the issue which concerns me and the thrust of what Senator Leahy complained about is the propriety of Mr. Starr's activity, and that need not involve the allegations and the substance. I think there has already been enough talk about that, in any event. 
Mr. Starr then advised that he took the tape recordings to the Department of Justice, met with the senior attorney and the public integrity section. There was a collaborative determination between the Department of Justice and independent counsel as to who should carry out the further investigation. Mr. Starr advised that the Attorney General then asked the special court of the District of Columbia Circuit to specifically enlarge Mr. Starr's jurisdiction so that he could proceed with this investigation. 
Now, we all know that Attorney General Reno has been very circumspect in the independent counsel issue as to appointment and as to extending jurisdiction--that has been a subject matter which has been talked about on this floor a great deal, to a substantial extent by this Senator. But the facts as Mr. Starr outlined them are that he proceeded in this way just as outlined, which is entirely appropriate because of the connection between what happened with Ms. Monica Lewinsky and what happened with Mr. Webster Hubble. That was obviously approved by Attorney General Reno when she then acted on information which Mr. Starr brought to her to request the special court of the District of Columbia Circuit to enlarge Mr. Starr's jurisdiction. 
I asked Mr. Starr further about the other statements which Senator Leahy had made. I now quote from the transcript: 
Senator Leahy: I look at the continuing and very selective leaks and tactics employed by Mr. Starr's office over the last few years and particularly over the last few days. 
I asked not only Mr. Starr about the leaks, which he emphatically denied, but also about the composition of the personnel who were handling this sensitive material, and Mr. Starr gave me some substantial detail about the attorneys who were on the matter in terms of their backgrounds and in terms of their professionalism, which Mr. Starr says is the effort made and he thinks is always the effort made, to avoid the leaks. We all know in Washington, DC, or for that matter, any place, the difficulty of establishing leaks, but if someone makes a contention, as Senator Leahy does, as to leaks, the question is, what is the proof of those leaks. 
Mr. Starr made an emphatic denial regarding the leaks, and spoke of the professionalism of the people that have the confidential information. 
Senator Leahy went on to say earlier today, `I have seen reports of two weekends ago that he,' referring to Mr. Starr, `was intent on conducting a sting operation to engage the President of the United States in secretly recorded conversations. Have we sunk this low, Mr. President, that we would do things like this?" 
I asked Mr. Starr about that, and he emphatically denied it. I, too, have seen press reports about the proposed sting operation, but I think it is very important that as we accord the President the presumption of innocence and as we look for proof before coming to any judgments about anyone, that the same thing apply to Mr. Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, and that a serious accusation about the sting operation ought to have some authentication and verification before it is made on the floor of the U.S. Senate. At least that is my opinion. 
Senator Leahy went on earlier today saying, `I have seen complaints,' he is referring to Mr. Starr, `he sought to curse a young woman'--I asked Kenneth Starr about that, and again he denied it in absolute terms--`and threatened her mother and father if she did not cooperate.' Again, Mr. Starr denied that in absolute terms. 
Senator Leahy then went on to say, `Mr. Starr's office seems 
oddly coordinated to aid the civil lawsuit against the President involving the Miss Paula Jones case.' Again I asked Mr. Starr about that, and it has been denied. 
Mr. President, I make these comments after talking to Kenneth Starr, particularly to state for the record exactly how Mr. Starr got into this matter on the consensual monitoring. A consensual monitoring under Virginia law is appropriate when one party to the conversation agrees to it so that in the action by Mr. Starr and the FBI agents in recording the conversation of Ms. Monica Lewinsky and Ms. Linda Tripp, where Ms. Linda Tripp has consented to it--that was a lawful consensual monitoring--and as explained by Mr. Starr, the nexus or connection justifying his conduct was because the same person had suggested providing a job opportunity for Ms. Monica Lewinsky with the same employer who had made similar activity with respect to Mr. Webster Hubble. 
It would be my hope that as this matter proceeds, that there would be a toning down of the decibel level and a real effort made to find out what the facts are before accusations are made against anybody. I think that applies to President Clinton, as I said so last week and over the weekend, and applies to Mr. Starr, and there has been a concern expressed that there is now an orchestrated effort made to discredit Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. I do not know whether that is true or not. There have been a number of statements coming out, but whatever the charges and accusations that were made against anybody--President Clinton, Independent Counsel Starr, anyone--they ought to be backed up by the facts and not a recitation of something that appeared in the newspaper where we know of the questionable reliability of what appears in the press. 
The real issue here is not necessarily what Mr. Starr has done but what the underlying facts are on the substantive matter at issue. If Mr. Starr has acted in an inappropriate manner, that can be reviewed at some time. When you deal with issues such as those involved here, we are not looking at a respective criminal case where the admissible evidence is judged on certain standards. We are looking at a real determination to find what the facts are so that we can make a determination as to what ought to be done in this matter. 
It is my view that once the facts are asserted, there will be general agreement about what the conclusions ought to be. But it is not the Independent Counsel's conduct at issue here. I think the Independent Counsel ought to conduct himself in a manner which comports with the manner of decency. That is his job and responsibility. Also, I think that he is entitled not to be vilified in newspaper headlines or newspaper stories. 
But the facts ought to be ascertained. The facts as Mr. Starr outlines them to me justify the steps that he took. That is not my view alone; that is corroborated by what Attorney General Reno has done in the case. 
Mr. President, in the absence of any Senator on the floor seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President I would like to enter into a colloquy with Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens concerning Federally Funded Research and Development Centers. 
Is it the chairman's understanding that it was the intent of Congress to exempt Federally Funded Research and Development Centers [FFRDC's] from the provisions of section 8041 of the fiscal year 1998 Department of Defense Appropriations Act which reduce funding for advisory and assistant services by $300,000,000? This exemption is necessary because FFRDC funding is specifically reduced by $71,800,000 in section 8035 of the same act.

Mr. SPECTER. I compliment the distinguished Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, for those very erudite and profound remarks. The U.S. Senate is graced by two women Senators, Senator Olympia Snowe and Senator Susan Collins. I know that Senator Margaret Chase Smith is a role model for them as she is a role model for so many in America--men as well as women. 
It is with some frequency I quote her famous dictum, to distinguish between the principle of compromise and the compromise of principle. 
I think with the qualities of Senator Collins and Senator Snowe, they would be in the U.S. Senate even without Senator Margaret Chase Smith blazing the trail for them in Maine, but it didn't do them any harm. 
That was an extraordinary statement. I have had the good fortune to work with both Senator Collins and Senator Snowe on a little Wednesday lunch group and on the Governmental Affairs Committee. Senator Collins has done outstanding work on the Governmental Affairs Committee and I think there is more coming.

Mr. SPECTER. I have sought recognition today to comment about the pending judicial nomination of Judge Frederica A. Massiah-Jackson who has been nominated for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Judge Massiah-Jackson currently serves on the court of common pleas of Philadelphia County where she has been a State court judge for the past 14 years. I believe Judge Massiah-Jackson should be confirmed, and regrettably that will not happen today, which is the last day of the session, because two of our colleagues have insisted on rollcall votes, and one colleague insisted on an opportunity to debate the nomination beyond a rollcall vote. 
It appears virtually certain, if not certain, that there will be no rollcall votes today, our last day in session, because our distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, had announced that he would not have rollcall votes unless he gave Senators who are widely dispersed at this time an opportunity to come back, and therefore the business of the Senate is going to be completed by voice votes. 
I do not question the judgment of my colleagues to ask for rollcall votes, although customarily we do not have rollcall votes on district court nominees. Perhaps it would be sufficient for individual Senators to note their objection for the record. These two Senators have already noted their opposition to Judge Massiah-Jackson on the rollcall vote in the Judiciary Committee where she was recommended for nomination by a 12 to 6 vote. 
Judge Massiah-Jackson had substantial Republican support in the committee and she has the support of my distinguished colleague, Senator Santorum, as well as myself, the two home State senators. It is the practice for the caucus to rely upon home State senators on matters involving U.S. district court judges. 
Judge Massiah-Jackson has been questioned on two intemperate remarks which she made, one which she thought was under her breath, and has acknowledged her error, and I think it fair to say that if two intemperate remarks were disqualifiers or a disqualifier from being a Federal judge or a U.S. Senator, for most positions, perhaps all positions of responsibility, nobody would hold any job of responsibility because intemperate remarks escape all of us from time to time. She has apologized. The Senator who presided at her hearing noted with some acknowledgment the sufficiency of that particular apology. 
Judge Massiah-Jackson has been questioned about sentencing. She has tried more than 4,000 criminal cases. There were 95 appeals taken and she was reversed in some 14 cases, which is a pretty good record. Her rating on the standard for judges on compliance with the sentencing guidelines is well within the norm of her contemporaries. She had a rating in the 72- to 82-percent compliance at a time when the compliance of other common pleas judges was in the 70- to 86-percent range. 
She had questioned, from time to time, certain police officers. I was district attorney of Philadelphia for 8 years following being an assistant D.A. for some 4 years, and while I was district attorney I ran tough investigating grand juries where there was evidence of narcotics violations, narcotics corruption within the police department. There have recently been a spate of many reversals and Federal investigations by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. So it is not unusual to have questions about police conduct following on the old statement that there are some bad apples in the barrel. 
I think in totality, Judge Massiah-Jackson's record is a very good one. I am disappointed she will not be confirmed because we have just had the swearing in of circuit Judge Midge Rendell, and we are now planning the swearing in of Judge A. Richard Caputo in Wilkes-Barre and former State court Judge Bruce Kaufman in the Eastern District. 
I am sorry Judge Massiah-Jackson will not be sworn in before the end of the year to take on the very substantial duties of helping the backlog in the Eastern District. I do thank my distinguished and majority leader, Senator Lott, for agreeing to list Judge Massiah-Jackson on the second day when we return. We are due to come in on January the 27. That is expected to be the night of the State of the Union speech, and Senator Lott has told me that he will schedule Judge Massiah-Jackson for floor debate and a vote on the day we return. It may be that there will be two other judges in a similar position, so I thank Senator Lott for his assistance there, and I thank him, also, for aiding me in the determination of Senators on our side of the aisle who have so-called holds.

Mr. SPECTER. I compliment our colleagues, Senator Grassley and Senator Wyden, for their initiative in moving to end the practice of a hold. For those watching, if anyone, on C-SPAN2 at the moment, a hold is a Senate procedure which is secret, where the Senator says that matter may not move without notifying me. The final days of the session are sufficient to stop any action on an individual by a statement that there be insistence on debate, where there is no time for votes, or when we are not having them, as we have not had any for the past several days. 
I intend to join Senator Grassley and our Republican caucus to try to end this pernicious practice. It simply ought not to prevail in an open society and in an open setting. 
If someone has an objection to some individual or to some bill, I think it only right that the individual stand up and state the objection. I do thank my colleagues who had objected to Judge Massiah-Jackson for being forthright in discussing the matter with me, and I understand an honest difference of opinion. I respect that difference of opinion. I don't agree with it, but I do respect it, so long as you have an opportunity to discuss the matter, to find out what is happening and we can try to do something about it.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to join Senator Biden in introducing the Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act of 1998. The purpose of this bill is to build on legislation we passed last Congress and provide education benefits to the families of slain or disabled State and local public safety officers. 
Last year, Congress passed the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act. This law provides for the education of the spouse and dependent children of Federal law enforcement officers who die or are totally disabled in the line of duty. 
I was moved to introduce last year's legislation after meeting with the widow of Mr. Bill Degan, the U.S. marshal who was killed in the tragic incident at Ruby Ridge. Mrs. Karen Degan, his widow, brought to my attention the fact that the families of slain Federal law enforcement officers were not eligible to receive the educational benefits which the Government gives to the families of slain soldiers in our armed services. My legislation eliminated this disparity. 
The program we created last year, however, is only available to the children of Federal law enforcement officers. Yet the idea behind the law applies equally to all public safety officers, Federal, State, or local. When someone gives his or her life protecting the safety and well-being of the general public, it is the very least we can do to ensure that the officer's children and/or spouse can continue on the educational path they would have followed had their parent or spouse not been killed in the line of duty. 
Today we seek to remedy this disparity between Federal and non-Federal officers by introducing the Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act of 1998. This legislation will extend these same educational benefits to the dependents of all public safety officers--Federal, State, county and local law enforcement officers, correctional officers, and fire and rescue personnel--who have given their lives in the line of duty. 
Under this bill, the Attorney General will administer a program which will provide up to $4,485 per child, per year to attend a 4-year college. This is the same amount of educational assistance the Federal Government provides to the dependents of slain or disabled veterans and Federal law enforcement officers. I would note that this program is subject to appropriations and does not constitute an entitlement. 
I would prefer that we did not have to worry about death and disabling injuries for public safety officials, but it is a fact of life that every year there are tragic losses. We are obligated to remember the families of those officers who have paid the ultimate price to keep our streets and homes safe.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will begin on the question of fast track with a statement made by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia saying that it would be disingenuous to believe that trade agreements would not be rewritten in the U.S. Senate. I say to my colleagues that I consider it unlikely that trade agreements would be rewritten in this body, considering how hard it is to get 51 votes against a committee report or against an administration position or that we might have the structure on amendments made so 
that it would require passage of a bill then subject to veto by the President and then subject to a two-thirds override. But if, in fact, trade agreements would be rewritten on the floor of the U.S. Senate or on the floor of the House of Representatives, then it might be something which is desirable. 
I oppose fast track, although I am not opposed to free-trade agreements, because I do favor such agreements and supported NAFTA, the North American Free-Trade Agreement, and GATT, notwithstanding very considerable constituent opposition in my own State. Being elected in Pennsylvania, with 12 million constituents, it is my view that I ought to have standing as a Senator to offer amendments, and because we have had a certain amount of wisdom coming from Members of Congress on issues of trade, which are matters of very, very considerable importance. 
I will analogize the activity of the Senate regarding trade agreements to what we do on treaties in general, where a two-thirds vote is required. If amendments could be offered to trade agreements, it could be of some substantial value to the President, and the executive branch in negotiating agreements with foreign powers saying, `Well, we understand your position, but you have to understand ours, and there are certain political realities in the U.S. Congress.' 
We have a variety of protocols where you have executive agreements which look very much like treaties which are not subject to ratification by the Senate. A very complicated agreement was entered into with North Korea which involved very substantial issues on nuclear power. That was the subject of a letter from the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the chairman of the Interior Committee and myself, in my capacity last year as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, asking for Senate action. So there are precedents for having the Senate exercise its judgment and I think we have some substantial judgment in the field. 
I recall very well in 1984, when the International Trade Commission came down with a decision which was in favor of the American steel industry. At that time the issue arose as to whether President Reagan would overrule the decision of the International Trade Commission. Senator Heinz, my late departed colleague, a great Senator, and I went to talk to then Secretary of Commerce Mack Baldrige who thought that we were right, the American steel industry ought to have that favorable decision from the International Trade Commission. Bill Brock, the trade representative, agreed. We then talked to Secretary of State George Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger who disagreed. 
The President overruled the International Trade Commission and made the decision which was based really on foreign policy and defense policy. The American steel industry paid a very high price which should have been paid out of the general revenues. Western Pennsylvania especially, but eastern Pennsylvania, too, with Bethlehem Steel, suffered very substantially. 
Right now, my distinguished colleague, Senator Santorum, and I are working very hard on trying to get Cigna fair access to the Japanese markets. Notwithstanding certain commitments by the executive branch and the trade representatives, we have not been able to accomplish that. 
So it seems to me that there is a very good reason on principle why matters which come to the Congress on trade issues ought to be subject to amendment. We have some understanding of the trade issues, and we have some understanding of our States' stakes. I think it would be entirely appropriate for us to be able to offer those amendments and not to have to simply vote yes or no, take it all or leave it.

Mr. SPECTER. Before commenting briefly on judges, I have a very brief personal note. Yesterday, I spoke about the appropriations bill on Labor, Health and Human Services. My 3-year-old granddaughter, Silvi, was watching the screen on C-SPAN 2, perhaps one of the few watching. She said to her father, my son, Shanin, `Why doesn't he say hi?' 
I told her I might speak this afternoon and alerted her, although the time is somewhat delayed. I do not think it is somewhat inappropriate to say hi to my granddaughter, Silvi. I know in the old days, they said you couldn't do that. But without objection, I say hi to her.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to say a word or two about judges. 
It is a very difficult matter getting judges confirmed in the Senate. I congratulate my distinguished colleague, Bruce Kauffman, a former Supreme Court Justice in Pennsylvania, for his confirmation yesterday. 
I understand the distinguished Pennsylvanian from Wilkes-Barre, A. Richard Caputo, Esquire, is subject to confirmation with no objection. 
I urge my colleagues to support the confirmation of Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson, for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, Federal court. Judge Massiah-Jackson has a very distinguished record on the State Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia County. Although some questions have arisen, a couple of intemperate remarks, I think, do not disqualify her. If intemperate remarks were disqualifiers, there wouldn't be any Federal judges, there wouldn't be any Senators or anybody in any other positions. Questions have arisen about her sentencing. Out of 4,000 cases, 95 appeals were taken and reversals in only 14 cases. I urge my colleagues to support Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson so we can fill a vacancy on the Federal court.

Mr. SPECTER. I certainly agree that prevention research is a very specialized field that must prove itself to be culturally relevant and attractive, or it will be meaningless. It is also my understanding that diabetes is rampant among American Indians and getting worse. The rate is almost three times as high among Indians as it is among all Americans. The national rates of diabetes among Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians are also among the highest in the Nation, and are about double the rate among Americans as a whole.

Mr. SPECTER. Yes, I would agree that the increase in funding for CDC for fiscal year 1998, includes sufficient funds for this purpose, and the House has concurred with the Senate's intention to do so. The conferees intend to increase both prevention and treatment activities among native Americans. The final bill also contains at least $2 million for CDC programs among native Americans. In addition to this general Indian funding, I believe the Senate report clarifies our intention to fund the Gallup prevention research center in the first year from fiscal year 1998 funds. This program would then continue as envisioned by Secretary Shalala on a multiyear basis.

Mr. SPECTER. As the Senator from New Mexico has suggested, I would hope that IHS would invite the CDC to participate in developing meaningful prevention strategies at the Gallup research center with funds from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I would add that the resources of the National Institutes of Health [NIH] and the National Center for Genome Research would be other valuable resources for both the CDC and the IHS to incorporate into their efforts. 
I thank the Senator from new Mexico for his coordinated efforts to bring immediate assistance to American Indians, especially the Navajo and Zuni Indians in the Gallup area. I believe this diabetes prevention research effort in Gallup will benefit the Pueblo Indians, Apaches, and other Indian tribes nationwide. 
I fully support Senator Domenici's efforts to start and maintain funding for the national diabetes prevention research center in Gallup, NM, funded by both CDC and IHS resources as we have discussed.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation to reauthorize the Delaware and Lehigh Canal National Heritage Corridor Act of 1988, which established a Federal Commission to assist in planning and implementing an integrated strategy for promoting and protecting the cultural, historical, and natural resources in the canal region, which consists of a 150-mile long corridor stretching through five counties in eastern Pennsylvania, including Luzerne, Carbon, Lehigh, Northampton, and Bucks. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have been pleased to support annual funding for the work of the Commission, and believe reauthorization is necessary to continue preserving the heritage of the canal region and to promote economic development. 
Mr. President, let me provide you and my colleagues with some background on the Delaware and Lehigh corridor. The Delaware Canal first opened for regular commercial navigation in 1834 and served as the primary means for transporting coal and other bulk goods from the anthracite region of Pennsylvania to New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and even to industrial centers in Europe. The canal provided an early and essential link in a 4,000 mile national transportation route and helped to transform Pennsylvania from a solely agrarian State to the center of an industrialized society. The Delaware Canal and the Lehigh Navigation Canal played a critical role in supplying our developing Nation with the coal that heated its homes and the fuel for its burgeoning factories. 
In 1998, Congress wisely established the Corridor and the Delaware and Lehigh National Corridor Commission. The commission was charged with conserving, interpreting, and promoting the natural, historic, cultural, scenic, and recreational resources of the region. Nine national historic landmarks, six national recreation trails, two national natural landmarks, and hundreds of sites listed on the National Register are situated within these boundaries. In addition, 7 State parks, 3 State historical parks, 14 State scenic rivers, and 14 State game lands are located in the region. This is an impressive and historic area that must be preserved. More than three million visitors explore the region each year to see the numerous attractions in the area, including the Allentown Art Museum, Eckley Miners Village, Washington Crossing, and Moravian Tire Work. 
Another attraction that will preserve the region's heritage and promote economic development is a cultural center in Two Rivers Landing that will house the city of Easton's National Canal Museum and the Crayola Factory. Two Rivers Landing first opened in June 1996, marking a rebirth of Easton's downtown. Since then, more than 300,000 visitors have come. The project has been credited with attracting 82 businesses to downtown and creating nearly 100 jobs. 
The Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor has established a strong record of successful partnership projects that link Federal, State and local governments with nonprofit organizations and private industries. Two Rivers Landing is just one of the many successful private/public partnerships led by the Commission. Another example is the Lehigh River Foundation, which was formed in 1991 to give private sector support the Commission's initiatives. The foundation has raised more than $150,000 from local businesses and individuals to create an educational film, sponsor heritage events, and establish an information center in 
Bethlehem, the site of the only American 19th century steel plant to retain all of its historic elements. The corridor is sustained by broad public involvement and nonfederal investment. There are many project supporters, such as the Heritage Conservancy, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development. Corporations such as Binney and Smith, makers of Crayola products, Bethlehem Steel, and Mack Trucks have also made major financial commitments to support new industrial museums and attractions. 
Statutory authority for the Delaware and Lehigh National Corridor Commission will expire in November, 1998 unless Congress acts. I believe there is ample need for reauthorization because of the unfinished work of the Commission. I would note that the Commission was authorized to receive up to $350,000 in operating funds a year, but funding for the program did not begin until 1990, and since then, it has regularly received only $329,000 a year through the annual Interior and related agencies appropriations bill. 
The primary reason for reauthorization is the delay in implementing a Management Action Plan for the region. The 1988 act mandated a series of studies and public meetings in order to complete a management action plan, which will serve as an action agenda for the first 10 years of corridor development. The management action plan did not received final approval from the Secretary of the Interior until August, 1994. Further, the findings of the management action plan envisioned a 15-year implementation period after approved by the Secretary. I am concerned that with less than one year left until the Act expires, there is insufficient time to implement the plan to help conserve the resources of this historically significant region. 
The Corridor Commission has made significant progress and there is public enthusiasm and support for the projects being carried out by the Commission, particularly where they promote economic development. However, they can not do this alone. There is a real need for sufficient Federal support of operations. I would note that the Commission must, by law, raise sufficient private and other nonfederal funds so that the annual Federal grant to the Commission constitutes no more than 50 percent of its operating budget. For each government dollar raised, the Commission has been successful in leveraging $8 to $14 in matching funds. This project has clearly demonstrated that Federal investment acts as a catalyst for local and private investment. 
Building on the success of the Corridor Commission, my legislation will authorize an increase in the Commission's operating budget from $350,000 to $650,000 a year, which will leverage additional private, State, and local funds. My legislation retains the 50 percent limitation on the amount of the Federal subsidy. Also, the legislation authorizes up to $10 million over 10 years to implement projects included in the management action plan and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, including the restoration and preservation of the Delaware Canal, and landing developments in 8 to 10 cities. The legislation extends the Commission another 10 years, thereby allowing the project to realize its goals while improving operating efficiency and extending participation.

Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, it is with great pleasure for me personally that I address the Senate on the conference report on the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. 
It has been a long, tortuous road to come to this position where if the Senate acts favorably on this conference report, it may then be presented to the President with the expectation that it will be signed into law. 
There are 13 appropriations bills which run the U.S. Government, and the appropriations bill on these three departments is the largest one in the Federal Government, downsizing of some $277 billion, and it is now larger even than the appropriations bill for the Department of Defense. 
This bill has had a very, very difficult process in coming through conference with a tremendous number of obstacles and difficulties confronting the legislative process at every step of the way. 
The process that this conference report has come to the floor with would perhaps constitute a textbook on legislative process except that it has been so extraordinary. That has been occasioned by the fact that there are so many so-called riders or legislative provisions on the appropriations bill which have enormously complicated the work of the conferees in trying to work out an enormous number of complicated problems. 
The most vexing of all of the issues--and it had a lot of competition--was the issue on so-called testing. There has been a generalized agreement that it would be desirable to test fourth graders on reading and eighth graders on mathematics but a great deal of disagreement as to how that testing ought to be carried out. There has been widespread sentiment expressed that the Federal Government ought not to be intrusive in the educational process. Then the problem arises as to just how this test would be worked out. 
When the bill came to the floor of the Senate, the excellent work was done by Senator Coats of Indiana, Senator Gregg of New Hampshire, with the assistance of former Secretary of Education Bill Bennett. In the hands of those three individuals, with the established record in the education field, great knowledge on testing, and all being very zealous to keep out Federal intrusion but to limit any testing approach to absolute necessity and to State control, it was the expectation of this body that when Senator Coats, Senator Gregg, and former Secretary Bennett agreed on a process, that it would satisfy even those most diligent in objecting to Federal testing. The Senate passed that amendment by a vote of 87 to 13, which is a very, very strong show of support in this body. 
The House of Representatives enacted a provision that there should be no funds on testing. When we came to the issue of conference a week ago Wednesday, a meeting occurred attended by the top leadership of the Republican Party of the House and the Senate, attended by the Speaker; by the House majority leader; by the No. 3 in rank in the House of Representatives, Mr. DeLay; the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Livingston; and the chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee, my counterpart, Congressman John Porter. And on the Senate side, we had our own majority leader. We had the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. And I was present. 
We agreed on a number of items. One of the foremost of those items on which there was agreement was the issue of testing. There was one party present who disagreed. That was the chairman of the authorizing committee in the House, my colleague from Pennsylvania, 
Congressman Goodling. But aside from Congressman Goodling's dissent, there was agreement at that meeting. 
A week ago Thursday the conferees met and hammered out quite a number of other complicated issues and came to agreement on a conference report. That night the agreement was repudiated, and we were back to square one with respect to the testing issue, which held up this bill until further negotiations were undertaken by the President and by Congressman Goodling. The testing issue has finally been resolved. A key part of the agreement on testing is that the matter will be submitted to the House-Senate authorizers early next year. 
This is one illustration as to what ought to be done by the authorizing committees so that the matters are not put on appropriations bills and bog down the appropriators. 
There was plenty of time during 1997 to have this issue of testing taken up by the authorizers. It really is a matter for the authorizers to make the congressional determination about what testing ought to be instead of tacking it onto an appropriations bill where it really does not belong. It is grafted onto the appropriations bill with this language, `No funds shall be expended for testing.' That is the way many, many substantive matters were grafted onto the appropriations bill. `No funds shall be expended for' purpose A, B, or C. 
When it became apparent to me that this issue was going to be one in the appropriations process after this bill was on the floor for initial consideration by the Senate, I scheduled a hearing. At the hearing, we heard both sides of the issue. The Secretary of Education came forward to articulate the administration's position on why there should be testing. We invited Congressman Goodling to present his views about why there should be no testing. After having had the benefit of that information, we then were in the position to proceed as best we could on that limited record to make the judgment on testing. 
We had in the conference many other complex issues that we finally worked out. We had the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, on the issue of not restricting welfare benefits to women who had been victims of domestic violence. That is a substantive matter that would be better considered by the authorizers. But it passed in the U.S. Senate by a vote of 98 to 1. At least, in my judgment, and the judgment of 97 other Senators, it had a very important public policy purpose, to give special consideration on welfare benefits and other matters for women who had been victims of domestic violence. Senator Murray was gracious to not press her amendment in conference, on an arrangement where the House of Representatives authorizing subcommittee made a commitment to take up the issue early next year. I was delighted to join Senator Murray as a cosponsor on that matter. 
That is one illustration of how we moved ahead to focus on money matters without that kind of a substantive provision.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to discuss an idea which has the potential to have a major impact on the rule of law in the United States by having the U.S. Senate exercise its advise function under the advise and consent clause of the Constitution to advise Presidents on who the nominee should be for the Supreme Court of the United States. 
The Supreme Court of the United States, as we all know, is the ultimate arbiter of determining what the law will be. In the session which ended last June, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down historic, really monumental decisions on dying, religion, speech, due process, States rights, congressional power, among many other decisions. 
The Constitution of the United States established the Congress, in article I, the President in article II, the Court in article III, with an implicit suggestion that the legislative body was preeminent, the executive second, and the judiciary third. 
But we know since the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Marbury versus Madison, the Supreme Court of the United States has been the preeminent institution, because the Supreme Court of the United States has the last word. 
The Supreme Court Justice, the late Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, said that the Constitution is what the Supreme Court says it is. 
We talk a great deal about the legislature having the power to make the laws and the courts having the limited power to interpret the laws, but the reality is, the brutal fact of life is that the Supreme Court of the United States makes the avant-garde decisions on the periphery and on the horizons of the law. 
We can do better, I submit, in the deliberations, the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States by a closer focus on the quality of those men and women who go to the Supreme Court. 
I expect our distinguished colleague, Senator Byrd, to join us on the floor in a few minutes to make a few comments about this idea, as the permanent resident scholar of the Senate and a great authority on constitutional law and a recent losing litigant in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the line-item veto case, where Senator Byrd, along with Senator Moynihan, Senator Hatfield, and Senator Levin challenged the line-item veto in the case of Raines versus Byrd. 
The Supreme Court of the United States, in that decision, ruled that Senator Byrd and the other Senators did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of line-item veto--a curious decision. In my opinion, who would have greater status to challenge the constitutionality of line-item veto than sitting Senators, especially the existing chairman of Appropriations, Senator Hatfield, and the former chairman of Appropriations, Senator Byrd? But that was the ruling of the Supreme Court. 
When we take a look historically, Mr. President, at what the Supreme Court has decided, and in many, many cases by 5 to 4 decisions, it is really astonishing the authority and the power wielded by the Supreme Court of the United States on the lives of every man, woman and child in this country, in a fundamental sense, more so than what the Congress does, and in an equally fundamental sense, more so than what the President does and the bureaucracy of the United States. 
In the famous Lochner versus New York case in 1905, the Supreme Court struck down an early attempt at labor regulation by holding that a law limiting bakers to a 60-hour workweek violated the liberty of contracts secured by the due process clause of the 14th amendment. It was a 5-4 decision holding up the efforts of the legislative branch to limit the workweek to 60 hours in the interests of public welfare. 
In Hammer versus Dagenhart in 1918, the Supreme Court, again by a 5-4 decision, struck down a labor law. This time the Keating-Owen Federal Child Labor Act, on the grounds that the commerce clause did not give Congress the power to completely forbid certain categories of commerce. 
In a celebrated decision, Furman versus Georgia in 1972, the Supreme Court of the United States, again by a 5-4 decision, struck down the death penalty provision under the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the eighth amendment. 
We have had a series of very controversial decisions where the Court has imposed seriatim limitations on what States may do by way of imposing the death penalty. 
In 1982, in Plyler versus Doe, the Supreme Court, again by a 5-4 decision, invoked the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to strike down a Texas statute which denied State funding for the education of illegal immigrant children and authorized local school boards to deny enrollment to such children. 
Again in a 5-4 decision in Webster versus Reproductive Health Services in 1989, the Supreme Court, in a case widely viewed as a retreat from Roe versus Wade, upheld various restrictions on the availability of abortion, including a ban on the use of public funds and facilities for abortions, and required viability testing after 20 weeks. 
Again, on a 5-4 decision in 1990 in United States v. Eichman, the Court invalidated State and Federal laws prohibiting flag desecration on the grounds that they violated the first amendment. 
In Adarand versus Pena, 1995, the Court held that Federal racial classifications like those of a State must be viewed under strict scrutiny standards. 
In the course of the past 5 years, on decisions from 1993-1997, there have been 74 decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States by a 5-4 decision. 
Mr. President, when there is a vacancy in the Supreme Court of the United States, there is no existing systematic way for the selection process to occur with respect to the Senate involvement under the advice section of the Advice and Consent Clause. We do know historically that when Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes retired in 1931, there was unique concern about who his replacement should be and that was because of the unique status which Justice Holmes had on the life of the law; the author of `Common Law' in 1881, member of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts for 20 years from 1891 to 1901, and a member of the Supreme Court of the United States for 30 years, until 1931, the author of perhaps the most brilliant decisions on clear and present danger, a Justice extraordinarily gifted. 
When he was set to retire, there was unusual public concern about who his replacement would be. President Hoover was reluctant to appoint a New Yorker when many people suggested Benjamin Cardozo, a very distinguished judge on the court of appeals in the State of New York. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, George W. Norris, made an effort to persuade the President that Benjamin Cardozo ought to be the replacement for Oliver Wendell Holmes, but it was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, William E. Borah, who is historically credited with making the critical suggestion when President Hoover handed Senator Borah a list on which he had ranked individuals whom he was considering for nomination in descending order of preference. The list contained 10 names, and the name on the bottom of the list was Benjamin Cardozo. The Senator looked at the list and replied, `Your list was all right, but you handed it to me upside down.' And President Hoover finally conceded, even though reluctant to appoint a Democrat and even though reluctant to appoint another nominee from the State of New York. Benjamin Cardozo was appointed on February 15, 1932, and the nomination won instant and unanimous approval by the U.S. Senate. 
In modern times, we have been very diligent in the exercise of our consent function. The hearings in the Judiciary Committee have focused enormous public attention when the nominees come forward because at that point in time there is an awareness of the importance of the Supreme Court. The decisions which come down, and the 74 decisions which have come down in the last 5 years 5-4, really do not create much of a public ripple, do not attract very much public attention, even though these decisions are of enormous, enormous importance. 
Because of this background, Mr. President, it is my thinking that the Senate ought to give consideration to establishing a panel of prospective Supreme Court nominees for submission to the President under our advice function, under the Advice and Consent Clause. Obviously, it is a matter that the President can take or leave, but at least we ought to make that pool available. 
I advance this in the closing days of the first session of the 105th Congress so that our colleagues can think about it over the intervening several months, and I will seek cosponsors, seek advice from my colleagues. I have talked it over with a number of the Members of the Senate, including members of the Judiciary Committee and the leadership. There has been a very responsive note about it. I have talked to some on the Supreme Court of the United States. The effort would be to try to diversify the background. Few would know, and many would be surprised to learn, that of the nine Justices on the Supreme Court of the United States, eight of them came from prior judicial appointments. 
From time to time when there is a suggestion that somebody be nominated who has a broader background--perhaps as a former Governor, perhaps as a former Cabinet officer, with more background--there is some reluctance. It is safer to appoint someone who has been on a court. It may well be, I think it is true, that the country would be better served by having a Supreme Court which had a more diverse background. One thought would be to ask for suggestions from, say, the chief judges of the Federal circuit courts of appeals to suggest individuals whom they know in their circuit--distinguished lawyers, distinguished professors, people from all walks of life; or to ask the chief judges of the U.S. district courts; or the chief justices of the supreme courts of the various States; or a cross-sampling of judges; or the bar associations of the States; or the American Bar Association; or from the public at large. 
Then the Judiciary Committee might well establish a practice--and this is a matter of flexibility--where we would inquire into the backgrounds of the individuals and compile a pool of prospective Supreme Court nominees. There are thousands of lawyers at this moment in America who would love to be judges, and all of them would love to be Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States as a very high honor and an opportunity to serve in a very, very important position. There is enormous legal talent in America, and very little of it, necessarily so, is called to the attention of the President of the United States when a vacancy occurs. From time to time you hear about a nomination and somebody was considered, and the next time a vacancy occurs that person is pretty much automatically put into the spot. 
I think it is not betraying the confidence to retell a story about Senator Howard Baker, our distinguished majority leader who later became chief of staff to President Reagan. When Justice Potter Stewart left the bench in 1987, Senator Baker said to President Reagan, `I'll prepare a list of possible replacements for the Supreme Court of the United States.' According to Senator Baker, President Reagan responded, `Do you think you could put Judge Bork on the list?' rather an interesting comment, perhaps even a curious comment, coming from the President of the United States. Of course he had the power to make the determination, certainly more than the power to decide who would be on the list among those who would be considered. 
So I advance this idea, Mr. President, as I say, in the closing days of this session, with my stated intention to discuss the matter further with my colleagues in an effort to develop more ideas as to how we might function and how we might activate and motivate the advice function of the Advice and Consent Clause. 
I ask unanimous consent that a very brief summary statement of the kernel of this idea be printed; a form of the resolution be printed with the caveat that it is not intended to be final but a suggested form; and that a listing of the Supreme Court decisions decided by 5-4 from 1994, 1995 and 1996--since I do not want to take the time to put them in the Record at this time--be printed, showing the tremendously important matters which are decided by a single Justice having such a profound impact on the law in the United States.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Byrd, for those comments about the substance of the resolution. When Senator Byrd joins on an issue of constitutional import, there is great weight. I thank him on a personal level for his very kind comments about me. When he started to talk about an appointment of Arlen Specter if Senator Byrd were President, I was about to start a rumor on `Byrd for President.' I still might. If it was the Attorney General job, I am not so sure, but if it had been the Supreme Court he was talking about, I might have had a little more motivation on that. 
In the case of Raines versus Byrd, where Senator Byrd challenged the line-item veto, in which a curious decision of the Supreme Court said that Senator Byrd, Senator Hatfield, Senator Moynihan, and Senator Levin didn't have standing, that goes to show you we need more advice from the Senate in anticipation. When Senator Byrd said he might have asked me to argue the case, I have argued three cases in the Supreme Court--most recently, in March of 1994, on the Base Closing Commission. It was the fastest 30 minutes of my life, to appear before the Supreme Court, and 7 of those sitting nine Justices had appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee. I noted a certain tenor of questions from the Court, similar to the ones, I had asked when they appeared as nominees for the Supreme Court. Although, I was not successful in that case, the Court being reluctant to upset 300 base closings, the Harvard Law Review published a detailed critique of the case and found that my position was right on the separation of powers. That was just a word or two on a parenthetical expression. 
 Mr. President, I am going to revise my approach a little bit and at this time formally offer this resolution on behalf of Senator Byrd and myself on the advise and consent function. I realize that it cannot be acted on in this session, but it will be a guidepost for revision after consultation with our colleagues. 
I again thank my colleague, Senator Byrd, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the Philadelphia section of the American Chemical Society, whose 5,000 members, along with their nearly 200 sister sections in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, have set aside November 2 through November 8, 1997, for a national celebration directing our attention to the many contributions of their scientific discipline. 
The science of chemistry gives us the power to understand and to use the elemental building blocks of all material things. The science of chemistry also provides the fundamental understanding required to deal with many of society's needs, including several that determined our quality of life and our economic strength. Chemists and chemical engineers use their powerful science in helping feed the world's population, tapping new energy sources, clothing and housing humanity, providing renewable substitutes for dwindling or scarce materials, improving health and conquering disease, and monitoring and protecting our environment, and strengthening our national security. 
As the American Chemical Society works to enhance public awareness about the crucial role that chemistry plays in everyday life during National Chemistry Week, I hope that my colleagues will take this occasion to recognize the chemists and chemical engineers in their States who have dedicated themselves to improving the quality of life for all.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this legislation designates the U.S. Post Office in Pottsville, PA as the Peter J. McCloskey Postal Facility. This measure is cosponsored by my distinguished colleague, Senator Santorum. A companion measure, H.R. 2564, passed the House last week and was cosponsored by all 21 members of the Pennsylvania delegation. 
Following service in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II, where he served with distinction as an aerial gunner instructor in the European Theater, Peter McCloskey worked for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and was later appointed as the supervisor for the Pennsylvania Bureau of School Audits, where he served until 1967. 
In 1968, he was appointed postmaster of the Pottsville, PA, post office and served in that capacity for 23 years until his retirement. During that time he earned the respect and admiration of not only the employees he supervised over the years, but the entire community as well. Since leaving the Postal Service, Mr. McCloskey continues to be active in his community, having served on the Pottsville Housing Authority Board of Directors. 
The legislation will serve as a fitting tribute to an individual who has given so much to the cause of public service.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to thank my colleague, Chairman Bond, for including in the conference report $700,000 for a targeted grant for economic development for Lehigh County, PA. I am advised that these funds will be used to establish an aquatic and wellness center on the grounds of Cedar Crest College. 
The center has much local support because it is designed to stimulate economic development in the Lehigh Valley. For example, the center is expected to host athletic events and bring as much as $3 million annually in economic benefits to the region. The center is also envisioned as a means of reducing juvenile crime in the Lehigh Valley. According to the center's planners, underprivileged inner-city youths will be provided free access to the center in the hope that it will provide a drug-free, healthy environment to juveniles and thus help break the temptations of street life and crime. We need to do much more to reduce juvenile crime, and offering civic diversions is an important means of accomplishing this goal. There will also be improved civic health for all social groups, particularly the elderly and the disabled. 
Private sources have raised $2 million of the $9 million cost of constructing the facility, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has included this project in its capital budget. Accordingly, I am pleased that the Congress has chosen to make available economic development funds for the center.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens concerning section 8123 of the fiscal year 1998 Defense appropriations bill, H.R. 2266. 
Is it the chairman's expectation that the Secretary of Defense will not exercise the authority in section 8123 with regard to specialty steel and other steel products encompassed in the following Harmonized System of Tariffs (HTS) numbers: 7208 (carbon steel); 7218 through 7223 (stainless steel); 7224 through 7229 (alloy steels, high speed tool steels and electrical steels); 7304 through 7306 (stainless steel pipe and tube); 7502 through 7508 (nickel-based alloys; 8105, 8108, 8109 (cobalt/titanium/zirconium-based alloys); 8211, 8215 (stainless steel flatware) unless the failure of the Secretary of Defense to exercise such waiver authority pursuant to section 8123 will trigger unilateral retaliatory sanctions by a foreign country?

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition this morning to compliment our distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, for scheduling floor debate on campaign finance reform. I think that this is a very important matter to be debated by the U.S. Senate and, hopefully, to be voted on as to amendments and, ultimately, final passage. 
I have long believed that campaign finance reform is indispensable in order to take out the tremendous amount of money that is present in Federal elections. For more than a decade, I have worked on the issue to have a constitutional amendment to overrule Buckley versus Valeo with Senator Hollings under the Hollings-Specter amendment. I believe that there is a very important distinction between amending the first amendment and overruling a specific Supreme Court decision, many of which are split decisions. 
There are many besides those on the Court who have an understanding of the Constitution. I think the Buckley decision was wrongly decided. When that decision was handed down, I happened to be in the middle of a contest for the U.S. Senate primary in Pennsylvania running against the then Congressman John Heinz. In the middle of that campaign, the Supreme Court ruled that an individual could spend as much of his or her money as he or she chose. My brother was limited to $1,000 under the law. He could have helped finance my campaign. With Buckley not being reversed, that has been a major impediment to dealing with these tremendous sums of money, plus the unlimited amount of independent expenditures. We have seen the ravages of soft money. We have seen millions of dollars contributed in Presidential elections, as in 1996, in the context where the candidates are pledged not to spend money beyond the Federal contribution. We have seen these ads which have been classified as `issue ads,' which are blatant ads urging the election of one candidate and the defeat of another, on both sides of the aisle. 
I have introduced campaign finance reform legislation myself which would deal with the issue of soft money, prohibiting it, and which would define an advocacy ad as one which shows the likeness or name of an individual urging his or her election or his or her defeat. With respect to the independent expenditures, they are touted as independent, but in fact they are not independent expenditures. 
My legislation would require that someone who makes a so-called independent expenditure make an affidavit to that effect, with strict penalties for perjury on the affidavit form showing the individual making it what the consequences are. That would then be filed with the FEC, with the requirement that the candidate on whose behalf the expenditure was made, plus the campaign manager, make a tough affidavit, so that you do not have the feeling that there is really no enforcement or enforcement so much after the fact that it is irrelevant. 
In order to deal with the problem of unlimited expenditures by individuals, my bill provides for a Federal provision analogous to the Maine `standby public financing provision,' which provides that if candidate A spends $15 million of his or her own money, then candidate B will have that matched by the Government. I am against generalized Federal funding. However, I do believe that such a provision would be a deterrent so that there would not be the necessity, or at least a very limited amount of governmental money put in the campaigns if they knew there would be no advantage because the Government would match it for his or her opponent. 
My bill further builds upon what we have seen in the Governmental Affairs hearing, to require that there be a limit and reporting on contributions to legal defense funds, which are a 
first cousin to campaign contributions. We saw in the testimony involving Charlie Trie, coming into the legal defense funds, pouring out hundreds of thousands of dollars. My bill further tightens the requirements as to foreign contributions which we saw on the Young development matter, where the money had a foreign origin and ended up in a political campaign committee. 
I had been unwilling to cosponsor McCain-Feingold as long as it had the provision calling for lesser expenses or free television time, because I think that provision is unconstitutional, in violation of the fifth amendment as the taking of property without due process of law. I know the arguments that they are public airwaves, but once the situation has been established on a property right, I think that constitutes a taking. I discussed that matter with Senator McCain some time ago, and once he says that provision is going to go, I am prepared to cosponsor McCain-Feingold. Last year, when the subject came up, I voted for cloture on McCain-Feingold. Although I didn't agree with all of its provisions, I thought the matter should come to the Senate floor and be voted upon. 
Regrettably, we will probably not have campaign finance reform, or we won't have campaign finance reform until there is a demand by the American people that we do so. Only that kind of a demand will move the Congress. My own sense is that we are far short of the 60 votes for cloture for cutting off debate. But I think there may be 8, 10, 12, maybe even more, Senators who would be influenced by a very strong constituent demand. That influences us from a very realistic sense. Regrettably, our hearings this week in Governmental Affairs have not been covered because there is no scandal. The media and the public are attracted, regrettably, only to scandal. It is my hope that as we move ahead in Governmental Affairs, we will have more public attention. 
Last week, when we had the testimony as to Roger Tamraz and his $300,000 contribution and the testimony about John Huang asking for money in the White House at a coffee, which the President, apparently, condoned, and the testimony about the man in the line giving the President a card suggesting millions of dollars of contributions and later being contacted by a Presidential aide, had that been on national television, I think the public might well be aroused. It is my hope that the debate here will be spirited. I think, realistically, Senate debates are unlikely to lead the American people to catch fire on this issue. But perhaps our Governmental Affairs hearings can do that, or supplement it by media attention generally. 
I think it is a very useful thing to move ahead with these debates on campaign finance reform. Again, I compliment Senator Lott for scheduling them, and I look forward to participating in those debates, aside from this brief comment in morning business. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BURNS addressed the chair.

Mr. SPECTER. On the issue of soft money and where it has gone, there is a very strong point that if the definition of issue advocacy, issue commercials, contrasted with advocacy commercials, if that distinction was sharpened up--my colleague and I discussed this at some length with Attorney General Reno when she appeared before the regular judiciary oversight hearing back on April 30 and the questions were propounded to her about these commercials on both sides, Republican and Democrat--Republican commercials extolling the virtues of Senator Dole, and Democrat commercials extolling the virtues of President Clinton, and knocking each other in reverse. Those were somehow viewed as being 
issue commercials as opposed to advocacy commercials. 
The question I take up with my colleague at this point, which is a corollary to the soft money, is whether the soft money would really have so much effect, and whether we couldn't contain it by congressional enactment on the question of constitutionality. I would be interested in the answer to two questions of the Senator, the distinguished lawyer Senator Thompson. If we said that--short of saying vote for President Clinton or vote against Senator Dole, instead if the likeness appears and the language is very strong urging the election of one and the defeat of another, I ask if that would satisfy constitutional muster, in the Senator's opinion, and what effect that would have on limiting the utility of all this soft money that we found in the 1996 Presidential election?

Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield further, on the issue of so-called independent expenditures, they appear in many cases--if not most--not to be independent at all, and that there is, in fact, coordination. Some people on the independent expenditure group are members of the candidate's staff collaterally, and there is good reason to flout the law because the remedies taken by the Federal Election Commission are often very late and very ineffectual. One piece of legislation that is pending would sharpen the requirements as to independent expenditures, calling for a tough affidavit with strong penalties, in addition to the regular perjury penalties, for the person who makes the so-called independent expenditure. And then finally, the FEC would require a corollary affidavit by the candidate on whose behalf the expenditure was made and the campaign committee to try to do something with teeth in it to stop the so-called independent expenditures, which are in fact coordinated. Would my colleague think that would be of some help to stop that pernicious practice?

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in seeking recognition, I am putting forward legislation on campaign finance reform which builds upon the experience of the Governmental Affairs Committee hearings, which are now in progress, on illegalities and improprieties of campaign finance reform. I have served on that committee for the past 8 months while we have conducted the investigation and the 6 weeks of hearings which we have had. The legislation which I am about to introduce builds on those hearings. 
At the outset, I compliment my colleagues, Senator John McCain and Senator Russ Feingold, for the work which they have done with the leadership. I have stated publicly that I applaud their efforts, but I disagree with a key provision of their bill, S. 25, which would give candidates free television advertising time. I have been advised that the McCain-Feingold bill may be modified as to that aspect. 
I have talked to my colleague, Senator McCain, today and had previously circulated my bill. Senator McCain advises he is interested in bringing the matter to the floor next week. We discussed the possibility of integrating the legislation or my adding amendments to his proposed bill. 
I have circulated this proposed legislation among a number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I think there is an excellent chance we will have a number of cosponsors to this legislation. But I want to proceed now to make this brief statement on the substance of my legislation and to put the bill in so that our colleagues could consider this bill during the course of the next week before the matter comes to the Senate floor. 
My bill does six things. 
First, it eliminates `soft money.' We have seen an avalanche of soft money, into the hundreds of millions of dollars, influencing the 1996 election. 
My bill, second, defines `express advocacy' to enforce the intent of the Federal election laws to prevent coordinated campaigns. 
What we have seen on both sides of the aisle from both Democrats and Republicans are advertisements in the 1996 election, by the Republicans extolling the virtues of Senator Dole and criticizing President Clinton, and vice versa for the Democrats, praising President Clinton and criticizing Senator Dole. But for some reason those advertisements have not been defined to be `express advocacy.' 
The third provision of my bill would make `independent expenditures' truly independent by requiring affidavits from those who are involved in the process. 
My proposal would say that if someone is to make an independent expenditure, that person will have to file with the Federal Election Commission, swearing under oath under the penalties of perjury that the expenditure is truly independent. 
Then after that affidavit is filed with the FEC, the FEC will notify the candidate and the committee on behalf of whom the independent expenditure was made and require from that candidate and that committee an affidavit subject to the penalties of perjury that there is no coordination. My experience as prosecuting attorney has been that when people are compelled to take affidavits, they pay a lot more attention to what they are doing than some provision of the law which they might not know about, might not understand, or think has been disregarded. My sense is that as a general matter, not in all cases, but in many cases, these so-called independent expenditures are not independent at all. 
The fourth provision that I am proposing would be to try to deal with the Buckley versus Valeo decision that anyone may spend as much of his or her own money that he or she chooses. 
My bill incorporates the so-called Maine Standby Public Financing provision where, illustratively, if candidate A spends $10 million of his/her own money, then there would be public financing for the amount by which such expenditure exceeds the relevant spending cap. 
I am opposed to public financing generally, and opposed S. 2 which was introduced in this body years ago on that subject, because I think there ought not be public financing. But this `standby' provision I think would act principally to deter somebody from spending $10 million of their own money. The Government would put up money equal to the amount of the excess. I think that would deter somebody from spending the money knowing that their financial advantage would be matched. And to the extent that the expenditures would have to be made, I think that is worthwhile. It would stop people from buying seats in the U.S. Congress. 
The fifth provision would eliminate foreign transactions which funnel money into U.S. campaigns. 
Our Governmental Affairs investigation has shown what happened in the so-called Young brothers' transaction which went through the Republican National Committee and ended up placing foreign money in 
a political committee. This legislation would preclude that from happening again. 
The sixth and final provision would impose limitations and require reporting of contributions to the legal defense funds for Federal officeholders and candidates. 
The Governmental Affairs hearings have again shown, with the actions of Mr. Charlie Trie, hundreds of thousands of dollars came into the Clinton campaign for the legal defense fund. They were not reported. They were not identified. They were kept secret until after the election had occurred. And they are first cousins to campaign contributions. And this legislation would impose limitations and required reporting. 
Mr. President, this legislation is being introduced a little earlier than I had intended because I believe that we will have a number of cosponsors, Senators who are now considering the bill. But I thought it important to make this brief statement and to put the provisions of the bill into the Congressional Record so that Senators may have an opportunity to consider this proposal between now and next week when there may be an opportunity in one form or another to discuss campaign finance reform. 
As I say, with the modification that Senator McCain has apparently made taking out the provision requiring free television time, it may be possible to integrate these two bills or piecemeal amendments from my legislation into the McCain-Feingold bill. I had been unwilling to cosponsor that legislation because I think that constitutes a taking in violation of the provision against due process against taking without compensation. 
Six months of investigation and 5 weeks of hearings by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee have confirmed my conclusion and the view of most Americans that campaign finance reform is necessary. Politics is awash in money--corrupting some, appearing to corrupt others, and making almost everyone in or out of the system uneasy about the way political campaigns are financed. 
I believe my colleagues Senator John McCain and Senator Russ Feingold have done an excellent job in providing leadership for campaign finance reform even though I disagree with the key provisions of their bill (S. 25) which would give candidates free television advertising time. In my judgment, taking such property without compensation is confiscatory and unconstitutional. 
Our Government Affairs hearings have highlighted issues not covered by the McCain-Feingold legislation and those hearings have suggested the need for other legislative reforms. 
My proposed legislation would: First, end `soft money'; second, define `express advocacy' to enforce the intent of the Federal election laws to prevent coordinated campaigns; third, require affidavits to make `independent expenditures' truly independent; fourth, eliminate foreign transactions which funnel money into U.S. campaigns; fifth, deter massive spending of personal wealth by adapting a new `standby public financing' framework similar to one recently enacted by Maine; and sixth, impose limitations and require reporting of contributions to legal defense funds for federal office- holders and candidates.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for the purpose of engaging the distinguished chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee in a brief colloquy regarding the fish known as the blue pike. 
Mr. President, the blue pike was officially declared extinct in 1983 under the Endangered Species Act. This highly valued species, prized for food and sport, prospered in Lakes Erie and Ontario prior to its disappearance in these lakes. But recently, I have been made aware of reports from the Erie, PA area that the blue pike can still be found in Canadian lakes. It this is so, we have an exceptional opportunity to bring a species back from the brink of extinction. 
Mr. President, I would suggest that the Biological Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey consider investigating the existence of the blue pike. The Chairman has shown excellent judgment in recommending a bill which includes a $1 million increase for restoration of the Great Lakes fisheries and habitats in this legislation, and I think this is an appropriate area where this important work can be carried out. I am advised that this study and restoration plan could cost $250,000. This is a small price to pay to realize the economic and environmental benefits this study, if successful, would surely produce. Accordingly, I look forward to working with my colleague from Washington to address the blue pike issue.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for the purpose of engaging the distinguished chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy regarding the Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania. 
Mr. President, I would suggest that the U.S. Forest Service consider the possibility of funding the following three projects, all of which would enhance visitors' experiences in the Allegheny National Forest. 
The first project is for the construction of a central office in Marienville, Pennsylvania. For more than a decade, the Allegheny National Forest has requested funding to carry out this project. Currently, Allegheny National Forest Service employees work out of two small office buildings, a trailer, and two warehouses located separately from the district office. Construction of a central office will help alleviate additional travel and communications costs as well as improve the efficiencies in work coordination. 
The second project involves the rehabilitation of three boat-access campgrounds on the Allegheny Reservoir. These sites were constructed in the 1960s, but they have each outlived their expected life spans. Completion of this project would go a long way to improving access for the estimated 11,800 visitors who use these campsites each year. 
The last project concerns rehabilitation of the Buckaloons Recreation Area. This area is located within the designated Wild and Scenic River corridor of the Allegheny River. I am advised that visitors' complaints focus on water facilities, parking, and access to the area. The funds needed for this project would improve the Buckaloons Recreation Area to allow Pennsylvanians and others to more fully enjoy the Allegheny National Forest. 
Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleague from Washington to address these three important funding issues.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to address my views on the Bryan amendment regarding timber road construction in our National Forests. I am very concerned about environmental protection and safeguarding our Nation's forests, providing there is an appropriate balance for economic development and job opportunities. 
On Senate floor votes in 1986 and 1989, I supported reductions in the direct Federal spending no road construction by the Forest Service. If this amendment had been limited to road construction, I would have voted for it. 
However, I am concerned about the impact of the elimination of all funding for the purchaser road credit program. From what I have seen and heard, during my August visits to the Allegheny National Forest in Elk, Forest, McKean and Warren counties, elimination of the purchaser road credits would constitute a significant hardship. 
Accordingly, that provision of the amendment causes me to vote against it. 
I do so on the assurances which I have received that the administration is currently reviewing the timber road construction program and may make substantial revisions which would provide for appropriate environmental safeguards. 
This vote, for me, is a close call. If there is not adequate environmental protection from changes in the purchaser road credit program in the administrations continuing review, I would be prepared to reconsider my vote on this issue on next year's Interior appropriations bill.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the competency and appearance of integrity, if not the integrity itself, of the Department of Justice was called into sharp question when Attorney General Reno, FBI Director Freeh, and CIA Director Tenet briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee last Wednesday and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Thursday. 
In last week's briefing, the CIA Director advised that an individual, referred to here as `X', who had been identified in many news accounts as a major foreign contributor to political campaigns and campaign committees, has made significant contributions as part of a plan of the Government of China. 
The CIA Director further advised that the CIA obtained that information about `X' from the FBI, and it only put the FBI information on `X' together with the news reports on `X' after an analysis which was made following a request by Senator Bennett at the July 1997 FBI-CIA briefing of the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
The FBI Director advised that the information about `X' had been in the FBI files since September or October of 1995 on one report and since January 1997 on a second report. The FBI Director advised that the Governmental Affairs Committee was not told about that information at the July 1997 briefing because the FBI did not know it had the information. 
These disclosures raise a fundamental question of whether the FBI deliberately withheld the information or was not competent enough to know what information it had in its own files. Either alternative is a strong indictment of the FBI. 
With the new information on `X,' the question is: Where do we go from here on dealings with the Department of Justice and the FBI? 
When the FBI Director said the FBI did not know the FBI had the information on `X' in its files, based on my extensive dealings with Director Freeh, I accept and believe that he personally did not know the FBI had the information in its files. Frankly, I am not so sure that others in the FBI did not know of the import of that data. 
This matter obviously adds fuel to the fire on recent questions about the FBI and Director Freeh's leadership of that agency. There are questions on many matters, including the FBI laboratory, the FBI's handling of the interrogation of Mr. Richard Jewel in the Atlanta pipe bombing case, the FBI allowing White House people to look at confidential personnel background files, and the FBI's handling of the Ruby Ridge incident after Judge Freeh became director, as well as before. 
But notwithstanding those matters, I believe that Director Freeh is doing his job about as well as it can be done with that giant agency which is ever-expanding and taking on new worldwide assignments. But I do believe that Director Freeh is going to have to find out what went wrong here, take corrective action, including punitive measures, if warranted, and establish procedures to protect against its recurrence. 
It is really not a very complicated matter. All that is required is an index of names like `X' who have connections with the Government of China and then to cross-check those names against people who have appeared in the news media as major contributors to candidates or campaign committees. 
When I refer to this context, it is obviously not intended to be a comment on any special group. It is hard to understand why that cross-checking of a simple index was not done by the FBI. And it is even harder to understand why the Department of Justice investigators did not find out about it, if in fact they did not. 
In a context where the Attorney General has consistently refused to petition the court for appointment of an independent counsel, it may well be that either consciously or subconsciously, those under her command may be less inclined to pursue, vigorously, leads which may embarrass the administration. After all, the fundamental purpose of appointing independent counsel was to have someone in charge who was not allied with the administration, not beholden to the administration, and not motivated in any way to favor the administration. 
It is not unusual, as a matter of common experience, for subordinates to do what they think their superiors want whether or not they correctly speculate on their superior's wishes. Beyond giving a clear signal to all the subordinates, an independent counsel would be in a position to press hard on a continuing basis for people to make all searches and analyses which were not done here. 
Leadership and intensity establish a tone and purpose. From numerous indicators, that tone and purpose are not present in the current Department of Justice. 
The Attorney General said at last Thursday's briefing that she was `not comfortable now' to discuss cooperation with the Governmental Affairs Committee but would `want to sit down and talk with the Department of Justice task force.' 
There are two problems with her statement. First, she had ample time to discuss the matter with the task force since she had met with the Intelligence Committee the day before and certainly had some advanced knowledge prior to that meeting. Second, she has continually said she would be willing to consider our request, but consistently there has been no followup. 
The Governmental Affairs Committee was further advised at last Thursday's briefing that if in the future the Department of Justice found information like that on `X', they would `very seriously consider and talk about bringing that information to the committee.' That is palpably insufficient. 
An independent counsel should be appointed so that the individual can press to obtain all such information on a continuing basis and so that there is no doubt about the duty of all units in the Department of Justice, including the FBI and other governmental agencies, to follow the direction of the independent counsel. 
In short, Mr. President, we have a situation here where the FBI has information in its files since September or October 1995--almost 2 years ago--and other information since January 1997. That information is very important in linking an individual who is reputed to be a major campaign contributor, as noted in many news accounts, with a plan of the Government of China. Yet, that information was not made available to the Governmental Affairs Committee, and on the representation of the FBI not even known to the FBI. 
It came to light only because the FBI provides that information to the CIA. And the CIA had done an independent analysis at the request of Senator Bennett. Absent that request by Senator Bennett, absent the independent analysis of the CIA, today, we would not have that important link as we seek to understand the puzzle, put together the pieces on the so-called dotted lines, and understand what is going on in this matter. 
If we had independent counsel vigorously pursuing these matters and a clear-cut understanding throughout the entire Department of Justice and all Federal agencies, then we would have a realistic opportunity to get to the bottom of whatever is going on and take the corrective action. 
This is another link that I suggest is a very, very powerful link in the chain of evidence and circumstances really demanding appointment of independent counsel. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SPECTER. Funding for the Ryan White AIDS programs was a priority for the committee this year, and I worked very hard to make sure that we provided an adequate level for the Health Resources and Services Administration service programs, as well as, I might add, for research at the National Institutes of Health. 
I am pleased to assure you that S. 1061 contains $1.077 billion for the Ryan White AIDS programs, which is $41 million above the administration's request, and over $80 million higher than the current year's level. That includes $469.9 million for HIV health care and support services, of which $217 million is dedicated to AIDS medications under the State AIDS drug assistance program [ADAP]. That $217 million figure for ADAP compares to $167 million in fiscal year 1997, so it is a substantial increase in an atmosphere of budget constraints.

Mr. SPECTER. I am not sure we will ever have enough money in the Labor-HHS bill. It is a constant struggle. I have to say that one thing which alarmed the committee is the high cost of these new AIDS medications. Pharmaceutical research, as you well know, is extremely time intensive and costly, and this is especially true for AIDS drugs. 
The committee was very concerned about the lack of timely national data available to estimate the demands for AIDS medications funded by the ADAP program, and also, I might add, about the wide variation in State Medicaid policies on individual eligibility, benefits, and drug availability. We have asked the Secretary to develop benchmarks to measure progress in this area and to increase data collection and information sharing, and so we hope to have a better guideline in the future.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, for his cooperation on this bill and the outstanding staff: Bettilou Taylor, Craig Higgins, Jim Sourwine, Jack Chow, Dale Cabaniss, for the majority, and the outstanding work on the minority side by Marsha Simon and Ellen Murray. I thank the leadership of Senator Lott--who is right here--and has been here at all times. 
I believe the passage of this bill is noteworthy. We had great problems passing a separate appropriations bill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education for fiscal year 1996. We were not able to get floor action on a bill until April 1996. It should have been finished on September 30, 1995. We finally broke that logjam with an amendment, which Senator Harkin and I had offered, for an additional $2.6 billion for education and training programs. That legislation was then folded into the omnibus appropriations bill. So we did not have a regular Labor, HHS and Education appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996. 
Then the fiscal year 1997 bill was not considered separately by the Senate. Instead, funding was included in an Omnibus appropriations bill that was significantly written by the administration and leadership. I said at that time that I thought the process was inappropriate. Our constitutional system is to have Congress deliberate and pass the bills and then submit them to the White House for approval or veto. 
This year we were able to complete it the regular Labor, HHS and Education appropriations bill. It took a fair amount of time. We started on September 2. Senator Lott brought us back at 11 o'clock the day after Labor Day. We now mark its conclusion. I am delighted. I also thank the distinguished minority leader, the Democratic leader. We have concluded action on an important bill. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might have the attention of all Senators to discuss sequencing. It might be possible, realistically, to finish the bill this evening. The next amendment, following the vote, will be the Murray amendment, where there is 1 hour equally divided. But it is my anticipation that Senator Murray will use her 30 minutes, but there will not be a reply. The next amendment will be the Wellstone amendment, 40 minutes equally divided. Here again, I think that will be disposed of in less than 40 minutes. Then we have the Daschle amendment, which is 20 minutes equally divided, and then the Coverdell amendment, 10 minutes equally divided. 
It is the manager's intention to have votes on these four amendments later this afternoon, but it is impossible to say when because of the impossibility of determining the amount of time. But the votes will occur as soon as the arguments are finished on those four amendments. We will then go to the Gorton amendment, where we don't have a time agreement. But the Senator from Washington says he may be able to enter into one shortly after that discussion starts. That would leave us with only two amendments outstanding on school testing, where the parties are reasonably close to an agreement on the Teamsters issue, which we will, I think, be able to resolve. But that is yet uncertain. That will be the sequence.

And we expect to proceed soon to the amendment to be offered by Senator Daschle. And as soon as that is done, we will be proceeding to rollcall votes on four amendments. The time should not be too extensive. I just give notice to my colleagues that that will be occurring in relatively short order. 
Then following the votes we will proceed to debate on the Gorton amendment, and that will leave then two principal outstanding issues--the issue of school testing, where the parties have been negotiating and may be in a position to give us a final answer soon whether they could come to agreement or whether we will have to move ahead with Senate debate on that, and the issue with respect to the pending Nickles amendment. We will see what will happen on that, if we are in a position to move ahead there. I am not sure exactly what will occur there. 
Mr. President, I have just been advised that Senator Daschle is engaged in a meeting that he cannot leave at the moment. So we will have to defer action on his amendment. 
On behalf of the leader, I have been asked by staff, at the request of the majority leader, to propound this unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 5 o'clock today, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Murray amendment, No. 1118; to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the Wellstone amendment, No. 1087; to be followed by a vote on the Coverdell amendment, No. 1098. And I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to each vote. I ask, finally, unanimous consent that no amendments be in order to any of the previous amendments prior to the vote, and that the first vote be with the customary 20 minutes, and that each additional vote be--the first vote be 15 minutes, but we have the automatic extension of 5 minutes, and each subsequent vote be limited to 10 minutes, with the extension of 5 minutes, so they can expedite the vote process.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the 7 minutes intervening, I will utilize this time to submit a resolution which I had discussed extensively yesterday calling for the United States to cease any financial aid to the Palestinian Authority and for the United States to use its best efforts to persuade all of our allies to do the same thing. 
I believe that that course of action is necessary to change our policy in the Mideast, because there is no peace process. There is a great deal of talk about a peace process, but the reality, the brutal fact of life is that there is no peace process. But there is a war of terrorism, a one-sided war being waged by the Palestinians against Israel. 
The brutal fact of life, Mr. President, is that terrorism has replaced open warfare as a way of gaining military advantage. The wars which have been fought against Israel, the open warfare, has been unsuccessful, so this practice of terrorism is being pursued. The financial aid which has come from the United States and our allies has been used to build up the Palestinian Authority in many ways, including a 30,000-person police force, armed with highly sophisticated weapons. 
When Prime Minister Netanyahu made the accusation, after the March 21 bombing of the Tel Aviv cafe, that Chairman Arafat had given a green light, I sought a response from the Secretary of State. In her testimony a few weeks ago before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Secretary of State Albright said there had not been a green light, but also there had not been a red light. 
Mr. President, United States law requires that the Palestinian Authority make the maximum effort to stop terrorism. The Palestinian Authority is not a guarantor, but they have an obligation to make a maximum effort to stop terrorism. And since the March 21 terrorist attack, we have seen the July 30 terrorist attack, we have seen the embrace by Chairman Arafat of the Hamas leader, the picture seen around the world, comparable to the shot heard around the world, where in no uncertain terms Chairman Arafat is saying that he condones what Hamas has done and even encourages Hamas to do more. Then, on September 4, we had the most recent terrorist attack. 
These three terrorist attacks in the course of the past 6 months have killed 21 Israelis and wounded 330 other Israelis. So where is the peace process? There is none. The emperor has no clothes. It is time we recognized that fact. 
We have had, in addition, a report from an Israeli cabinet officer, Deputy Education Minister Moshe Peled, that Chairman Arafat knew in advance of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that it was going to occur. If that is in fact true, Chairman Arafat is an accessory before the fact, and that is a form of conspiracy and, under our statutes, subject to trial in a United States court. 
When I saw that charge I asked the Department of Justice to investigate. And we do have information that Mr. Peled was questioned by the FBI for some 2 hours but we do not know the results of that inquiry. 
I have discussed with the distinguished majority leader the issue about the necessity for bringing this matter to a head to provide some leadership on foreign policy where our Senate has the standing to do so. 
You just heard a lengthy distinguished speech by Senator Biden, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. The leadership has been taken by Senator Helms and others, and we have constitutional authority to act. 
Where the administration continues to supply funds to the Palestinian Authority, and those funds directly and indirectly go to build up the Palestinian Army, that is a practice which should be stopped. 
The administration had further talked about going to final settlement discussions between Israel and the Palestinians. Of course, that is a matter for the Israelis and the Palestinians to 
decide. But, I believe that it is an unwise policy for the United States to push that approach because the principles of the Camp David accord and the Oslo accord were to build up confidence, to have relationships which would build up and lead to final status negotiations when there was a basis for the Israelis and the Palestinians living side by side. Regrettably, that is not possible. 
We have repeated statements by Chairman Arafat and others of a belligerent nature spewing hatred. We have hatred being talked about in the schools. We have an atmosphere which hardly is conducive to final negotiation status. There had been talk after the Oslo accord of deferring the issue of a Palestinian State. The concern had been that there would be a Trojan horse, a secret Palestinian State inside of Israel. 
Well, that has not happened. It has not been secret. It has been open. You have a 30,000-person police force, military operation with sophisticated weapons. You have the chief of police who has been charged by the Israeli authorities with being involved in terrorist attacks and information from the United States. 
I spoke at some length about this yesterday, Mr. President. My comments are necessarily abbreviated today because there has only been a period of 7 minutes from the time I started until the 5 o'clock vote which is due to start soon. 
Today, I talked to our distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee about hearings on this subject, as I had discussed with Senator Lott. I believe that when Secretary of State Albright returns from the Mideast, it would be a good opportunity to hear from her about administration policy and to hear from the Attorney General and the FBI Director about what is happening with the investigation as to Chairman Arafat's possible complicity in the World Trade Center bombing. 
So I file the resolution, Mr. President. We are in the process of getting cosponsors.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of any Senators in the Chamber to proceed with the legislation pending, I will take this occasion for a few moments to discuss U.S. foreign policy in the Mideast. This is especially appropriate since today the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, is traveling to the Mideast in an effort to promote the so-called peace process. My very strong view is that the time has come for a fundamental reassessment of U.S. policy for the Mideast. The brutal fact of life is that there is no peace process. We talk of the peace process, but there is a one-sided war being waged today by the Palestinians, a war against Israel. 
Regrettably, terrorism has replaced warfare as a way of obtaining or seeking to obtain political objectives. After the Israelis were successful in the wars of 1948, 1956, 1967, and 1973, there has no longer been an effort to confront Israel militarily, but the insidious terrorist war continues. President Reagan said that the Soviets liked the arms race as long as they were the only ones in it, and then with the change of United States policy in the 1980's we brought the Soviet Union to bankruptcy and ended that matter. And now I submit it is time for a change in U.S. foreign policy in the Mideast because, simply stated, the emperor is wearing no clothes. There is no peace process. We have had continuing terrorist attacks for years, but in the last 6 months the situation has escalated. 
On March 21 of this year, on July 30 of this year, and on September 4 of this year, there have been bombings, murdering 21 Israelis and wounding over 330 other Israelis. On August 27, Chairman Yasser Arafat openly embraced the Hamas leader, specifically condoning and supporting the Hamas terrorism in a 
picture seen around the world: The famous shot heard around the world. This is the famous picture seen around the world as depicted on the front page of the New York Times. And in this embrace and in this kiss facially, Yasser Arafat has thumbed his nose not only at the Israelis but at the United States and our allies and all others who have poured billions of dollars into the Palestinian authority. 
My point is, simply stated, that it is time to stop that U.S. aid, and it is time that the U.S. exert its maximum influence to persuade our allies to stop that aid because of what has in fact happened. The Palestinians now have a police force of some 30,000. They have highly sophisticated weapons which are really not designed for a police force. Should Israel now turn over an airport to the Palestinians so that they can develop air power as well? 
The fundamental principle of the Camp David accord and the Oslo accord was that there would be confidence measures established, that there would be assistance to the Palestinians in Gaza and on the West Bank, that there would be an improvement in the standard of living, that there would be an opportunity for Israel and the Palestinians to live side by side. But the brutal fact of life is that that has not happened. And when the U.S. policy now suggests going to final status negotiations, it seems totally inappropriate when the confidence building measures have not worked. 
U.S. law now prohibits economic aid to the Palestinians on conditions imposed in an amendment introduced by Senator Shelby and myself in 1994 which became part of the foreign aid bill of 1995. That amendment provided that further U.S. economic aid was conditioned on two factors. No. 1, a maximum effort by the Palestinians to stop the terrorism. Realistically there cannot be guarantors. There is no such thing as an absolute success requirement. But there is a requirement of a 100 percent effort, and that certainly has not happened. The second requirement of the Specter-Shelby amendment was that the PLO charter be changed to eliminate the language calling for the destruction of Israel. That, too, has not been done, with some excuses about the Palestinian legislative group not convening, some representation that the accord signed on September 13, 1993, in effect changed the charter, but that is legally incorrect. The charter has not been changed. 
After the March 21 terrorist attack on a Tel Aviv restaurant, Prime Minister Netanyahu charged that Chairman Arafat had given a green light to the terrorists. When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appeared before the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, I asked whether in fact it was true that the Secretary of State knew the facts that Chairman Arafat had given a green light. Secretary Albright replied that there had not been a green light but there had not been a red light either. 
Now, Mr. President, if there is not a red light, then U.S. law requires an end to the economic aid. There is an absolute obligation on the part of Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to make that maximum, 100 percent, effort and it was not made. Earlier this year, in March, Deputy Secretary of Education Moshe Peled of Israel charged that Chairman Arafat had knowledge in 1993 before the bombing of the World Trade Center. When I noted that accusation, I called upon the Department of Justice to conduct an investigation as to what had happened there. I then pursued the matter by calling Deputy Secretary Peled myself. I could not talk to him because he spoke only Hebrew, and I spoke only English. But my associate, David Brog, who works with me on these issues, who speaks Hebrew, talked to Mr. Peled, who stood by his earlier comments. And it is my understanding that the FBI has questioned Mr. Peled and that an investigation is ongoing, but as yet we have not heard what the results of that investigation are. 
It was a difficult day for me back on September 13, 1993, when Chairman Arafat was honored at a ceremony on the lawn of the White House. It was an especially difficult day because many of us felt 
that Chairman Arafat should have been prosecuted for his complicity in the murder of our American Ambassador to the Sudan, Cleo A. Noble, Jr., and our Charge, George C. Moore in Khartoum back in 1973. Many thought Arafat should have been prosecuted for the murders of 11 Israeli athletes at the summer Olympics in Munich in 1972. Many thought, including this Senator, that Chairman Arafat should have been prosecuted for the hijacking of the Achille Lauro and the murder of Mr. Leon Klinghoffer who was pushed overboard in October 1985. 
But in the world of real politics, remarkable, strange, bizarre things occur, and I think such an occurrence was presented at the White House lawn back in September 1993 in conferring a joint Nobel Peace Prize on Chairman Arafat. It seemed to me that when Prime Minister Rabin shook Chairman Arafat's hand and then Foreign Minister Peres shook Chairman Arafat's hand, considering the fact that Israel had borne the brunt of the PLO terrorism, I should shake his hand as well, and I have on a number of occasions. Senator DeConcini led a delegation of which I was a member back in December 1993. Senator Hank Brown and I visited Chairman Arafat in Gaza in 1995, August. Senator Richard Shelby and I visited Chairman Arafat in Gaza in January 1996, and on each occasion we pressed him hard about stopping terrorism. And in August 1996 Senator Brown and I had obtained a long list of terrorists from now Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At that time, Mr. Netanyahu was the leader of the opposition. And one by one, we went over this list of terrorists with Chairman Arafat, and we heard his excuses one by one. But now Chairman Arafat has run out of excuses.

<TEXT>
Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, under a previous agreement, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, will proceed with his amendment for 1 hour. 
I have discussed the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton. He has two amendments pending. Let me be sure which of the amendments we have here. It is an amendment denominated to allow States to use funds under the Social Security Act to provide health insurance coverage for children with incomes above the minimum Medicaid eligibility requirements. 
Senator Gorton advised me he would be agreeable to a time agreement of 1 hour equally divided. He is not now on the floor, but he made that representation to me. I do not, frankly, like to proceed without having him on the floor, but I ask unanimous consent that we may proceed--well, I am advised there may be a question on the other side of the aisle. 
But let me proceed, Mr. President, to say that if we are able to lock in that time agreement, then the managers would like to proceed to the two debates, 1 hour each, which would bring us to 4:40, at which time we would have two votes stacked back to back. 
At the conclusion of those votes, or after the first vote, when the Senators are present, it would be my intention, as manager of the bill, to try to seek time agreements on the outstanding amendments which are pending at that time. The Senators will all be on the floor after the first vote and before the second vote. 
We are within striking distance of seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. If we could have Senators on the floor at that time, I think we could come to closure. We have the amendment by the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, pending on the tax issue. It is my hope that we can get a 1-hour time agreement on that, equally divided. I know that is agreeable to Senator Durbin, but there are others who may offer a second-degree amendment, Senator Ford perhaps, and others who are not now present. If we could get that resolved after the first vote, it would be helpful on the management of the bill.  
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

I am now advised, that even on recognition on our side of the aisle, we need to check with some other people. But let me say to Senator Durbin that it will be my effort to have him proceed at that time, but I want to consult with some of my colleagues, so that is not in the form of a unanimous-consent request.

Is the time agreement on the Gorton amendment cleared at this point? It is? 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent then that after the conclusion of the 1 hour of debate on the McCain amendment, we proceed to the Gorton amendment for 1 hour equally divided, and that at the conclusion of the vote on the McCain amendment, we will have a discussion as to sequencing further on the bill and at that time seek to have unanimous consent to proceed next to the Durbin amendment.

And in between, votes to be stacked on McCain and Gorton and after the vote on the McCain amendment, we will try to reach time agreements on the remaining amendments and try to clear at that time an agreement that Senator Durbin proceed next on his amendment.

I say that with reluctance because I know Senators have other plans. 
Mr. President, I would suggest that we proceed at this time to the debate on the amendment by the Senator from Kentucky on his second-degree amendment and perhaps in that intervening 10 minutes we could get Senator Wellstone to the floor to find a time limit.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe that the Senator from Kentucky has offered a worthwhile amendment. There is no doubt about the dislocation to tobacco growers occasioned by a settlement which will have the effect of crippling their business for public policy reasons which may yet be worked out. 
It is obviously uncertain at this point as to what will happen with the proposed global settlement on the tobacco industry, but I think this is another matter where public policy calls for certain action. There are some employees, some workers in the industry who are hurt. I think it is sensible to provide for those individual workers. 
Certainly, we have seen the demise in my State of the steel industry and the glass industry and the coal industry, and we have tried to take care of dislocated workers. As the distinguished Senator from Kentucky has articulated the amendment, the sense of the Senate to do that I think is acceptable. There may be a fair distance between the sense of the Senate and how it is going to be effectuated. With some frequency we see on this floor the Senate express its sense and then back off when it comes to putting dollars up to druthers. 
But in terms of the public policy behind looking out for the interests of the employees who will be injured by a global tobacco settlement, I believe the Senator from Kentucky has offered a worthwhile amendment, and we are prepared to accept it on this side.

Mr. SPECTER. May I interrupt my distinguished colleague for a moment to say there will be no further rollcall votes tonight. I have just been able to make that determination, and I know there are many Senators on the campus waiting to find out what is going to happen. 
I regret interrupting Senator Durbin, but I think that is worth a statement. We have the list fairly well pared down. When Senator Durbin finishes, I will announce the prospects for tomorrow.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask if the distinguished Senator from Illinois will withhold that motion for the present time. We cannot proceed to a rollcall vote tonight under a determination made earlier by the majority leader, which I announced as soon as we had heard it. There may be other Senators who wish to speak to this amendment. The Senator from Illinois would be preserving his position, in any event, since we cannot vote tonight, to carry this matter over until first thing tomorrow morning. We are beginning at 9:30, so that we can consider at that time if there are any other Senators on the floor who wish to speak.

Mr. SPECTER. I thank my friend from Illinois. 
Mr. President, we have made some progress in limiting the number of amendments. We have been advised by Senator Wellstone that he is prepared to withdraw a filed amendment on Pell grants. Senator Wellstone is prepared to withdraw a filed amendment on infrastructure, which leaves one pending Wellstone amendment on Head Start. I have been advised that Senator Wellstone is prepared to enter into a unanimous-consent agreement for 1 hour, equally divided, providing he has an opportunity to modify his amendment. I will not ask unanimous consent for the moment on that. 
Senator Wellstone has arrived on the floor. Mr. President, since the Senator has just arrived, perhaps I can ask my colleague if the information is correct that the Senator is prepared to enter into a unanimous-consent agreement for 1 hour, equally divided, on his Head Start amendment on the understanding that it may be modified, and he is prepared to withdraw the other two amendments, one relating to Pell grants and one to education infrastructure?

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, very briefly on the pending amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Alabama, I think the debate this evening has been very useful. The comments by the distinguished Senator from Utah are cogent. We have had the hearings as noted by Senator Hatch in the Judiciary Committee. It is tempting to eliminate the very substantial tax break which is presented in the reconciliation bill. Perhaps that is something that can be done now although the considerations advanced by the Senator from Utah are very weighty. 
The amendment offered by the Senator from Alabama to curtail the attorney's fees is very much worth considering. I am not sure that the proper place for it is on this bill because we really do not know all the underlying facts. When you talk about $250 an hour, that is a substantial sum of money on an hourly rate. When you talk about a total of $5 million, that is a substantial sum of money. The reports are that the attorney's fees in the agreement run into the billions. It may well be that before an intelligent legislative decision can be made on this matter, we will have to know a great deal more about the arrangements made by each State with the attorneys, what their work has involved, evaluation of the contingent nature, that is, a likelihood of failure so that a contingent fee is set and some consideration on the likelihood of success because if there is no settlement, then there are no attorney's fees to be paid, and that may be a fact-specific inquiry which will take some considerable time ultimately by the Judiciary Committee. 
But in any event, the stage is set. There are other Senators who want to discuss this issue. We will proceed to the conclusion of it when we resume consideration of the bill tomorrow morning at 9:30. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, in submitting a sense of the Senate resolution calling for the Secretary of Agriculture to immediately establish a temporary emergency minimum milk price that is equitable to all producers nationwide, and that provides price relief to economically distressed milk producers. We are joined by Senators Kohl, Moynihan, Breaux, and Landrieu. 
I have been working with my colleagues in the Senate over the past year in order to provide a more equitable price for our Nation's milk producers. Last year, dairy prices set an all-time high, with an average price of $13.38 per hundredweight. The price reached its peak in September at $15.37 per hundredweight, but the market experienced its largest drop in history during November, falling to $11.61 per hundredweight, which represents a 26 percent decline. During this same period, the cost of the dairy production reached a record high due to a 30-50 percent increase in grain costs. 
This record drop in prices has placed a tremendous strain on our Nation's dairy farmers, who have been forced to sell their milk for a price below the cost of production for much of the past year. In an attempt to provide some relief, and to ensure that thousands of small dairy producers were not forced out of business entirely, I joined with 19 of my Senate and House colleagues on November 22, 1996, in writing to Agriculture Secretary Glickman, urging him to take action to help raise dairy prices. Secretary Glickman responded on January 7, 1997, by announcing several short-term actions to stabilize milk prices. While these actions did have a small positive effect in increasing dairy prices, they did not provide adequate relief to our nation's dairy farmers. 
In order to hear the problems that dairy farmers are facing first hand, I ask Secretary Glickman to accompany me to northeastern Pennsylvania, which he did on February 10. We met a crowd of approximately 750 angry farmers who complained about the precipitous drop in the price of milk. 
During the course of my analysis of the pricing problem, I found that the price of milk depends on a number of factors, one of which is the price of cheese. For every 10 cents the price of cheese is raised, the price of milk would be raised by $1 per hundredweight. I further learned that the price of cheese was determined by the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, WI. According to a report created by the University of Wisconsin, there was an issue as to whether the price of cheese established by the Green Bay exchange was accurate or not. The authors of the report used a term as tough as manipulation. Whether that is so or not, there was a real question as to whether that price was accurate. Therefore, 3 days after the hearing in northeastern Pennsylvania, I introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution with Senators Santorum, Feingold, Kohl, Jeffords, Leahy, Wellstone, Snowe, Collins, and Grams. The resolution, which passed by a vote of 83-15, stated that the Secretary of Agriculture should consider acting immediately to replace the National Cheese Exchange as a factor to be considered in setting the basic formula price for dairy. 
In my discussions with Secretary Glickman, I found he had the power to raise the price of milk unilaterally by establishing a different price of cheese. Therefore, on March 10, I wrote to Secretary Glickman and urged him to take immediate action to establish a price floor at $13.50/cwt on a temporary, emergency, interim basis until he completed his action on delinking 
the National Cheese Exchange from the basic formula price. 
This subject was aired during the course of a special hearing before the appropriations subcommittee on March 13. At that time, Secretary Glickman said that the Department of Agriculture had ascertained the identity of 118 people or entities who had cheese transactions that could establish a different price of cheese. He told me that the Department had written to the 118 and were having problems getting responses. I suggested it might be faster to telephone those people. Secretary Glickman provided my staff with the list of people, and we telephoned them and found, after reaching approximately half of them, that the price of cheese was, in fact, $.164 higher than was being reported on the Cheese Exchange. On March 19, I again wrote Secretary Glickman and informed him of the results of my staff's survey. This price difference translates to a $1.64 per hundredweight addition to the price of milk. 
On April 17, I introduced two pieces of legislation to revise our laws so that they better reflect current conditions and provide a fair market for our Nation's dedicated and hard-working farmers. The legislation goes to two points. One is to amend the Agriculture Market Transition Act to require the Secretary to use the price of feed grains and other cash expenses in the dairy industry as factors that are used to determine the basic formula for the price of milk and other milk prices regulated by the Secretary. Simply stated, the Government should use what it costs for production to establish the price of milk, so that if farmers are caught with rising prices of feed and other rising costs of production, they can have those rising costs reflected in the cost of milk. 
The second piece of legislation would require the Secretary of Agriculture to collect and disseminate statistically reliable information from milk manufacturing plants on prices received for bulk cheese and require the Secretary to report back to Congress within 150 days on the rate of voluntary compliance with the survey. This bill was successfully attached to the 1997 supplemental appropriations bill which was signed into law on June 12, 1997. 
On Tuesday, May 6, 1997, the Department of Agriculture announced that they were replacing the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, WI, with a survey of cheddar cheese manufacturers in the United States in order to determine the price of cheese for use in setting the basic formula price. I am pleased to report that last Friday, the basic formula price jumped to $12.07, an increase of $1.21 over last month, as a result of increased cheese prices measured by this new cheese survey. 
While we have made some progress in providing relief to farmers, there is much more that needs to be done. This sense-of-the-Senate resolution will ensure that farmers receive the necessary support they need to continue to produce milk. This resolution makes it clear that in emergency situations, the Secretary of Agriculture should set a temporary minimum price for dairy that is equitable to all producers nationwide and that provides price relief to economically distressed milk producers, I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Feingold and me as we work together to revise the current dairy laws so that they better reflect current conditions and provide a fair market for our Nation's dedicated and hard-working farmers.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is my privilege today to ask that the Senate approve legislation to confer the status of honorary veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces to Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope. This resolution, House Joint Resolution 75, which was unanimously approved by the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs on June 12, 1997, is identical to a companion resolution, Senate Joint Resolution 36, which I, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, was honored to introduce on July 28, 1997. I am pleased to say that the ranking member of the committee, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, and 47 other Members of the Senate joined me as cosponsors of this resolution when I introduced it. 
Mr. President, the Members of this body, and the American people as a whole, are acutely aware of the contributions Bob Hope has made to the Nation. His service to country--and; most particularly, to its soldiers, sailor, marines, and airmen over a period exceeding 50 years--are legion. If any person in this country merits such an unprecedented honor--and Mr. President, it is my understanding that no person has ever before been conferred the status of honorary veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces--surely, it is Bob Hope. 
As I have stated, Bob Hope's contributions to this Nation are well known to all of our citizens. Less well known is the fact that Bob Hope is a naturalized American, having emigrated from his native England when he was just a boy. I am the son of a naturalized American--an immigrant who walked across Europe with barely a ruble in his pocket so that he could make his way to this country. So I know first hand that person of humble origins can scale the heights of this country. Few, though, have scaled the heights that Bob Hope has scaled. 
When I say Bob Hope has scaled the heights, I am not referring to his success as an actor, a comedian, or businessman--though his success in all three areas has been considerable. When I say Bob Hope as scaled heights, I am thinking of his place in the hearts of his adopted countrymen. 
Who in this country is more beloved by a broader spectrum of his fellow citizens than Bob Hope--people of all ages, races, religions, and beliefs? Perhaps none more than Bob Hope. For the past 50 years, this country's fighting men and women could count on Bob Hope to lift their spirits and moral when they faced the prospect of making the ultimate sacrifice. In World War II, in Korea, in Vietnam and, most recently, in the Persian Gulf, Bob Hope and his troupe were there to remind our fighting men and women that they were not forgotten, that their suffering was appreciated. Bob Hope was always with the troops--especially during the holidays--enduring hardship, and often significant physical danger, so that he might encourage those facing greater hardship and danger. Three generations of veterans will never forget how much he cared. 
Those three generations of veterans wonder how they might properly recognize Bob Hope. He is already a recipient of the Nation's highest civilian decorations, the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. President Carter hosted a White House reception in honor of his 75th Birthday. President Clinton bestowed upon him the Medal of the Arts. He has received more than 50 honorary doctorates, and innumerable awards from civic, social, and veterans organizations. But Bob Hope cannot say that he is a veteran--in my mind, one of the most honorable appellations one can carry. This legislation will remedy that. 
I ask that all of my colleagues join me in approving legislation designating Bob Hope an honorary veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces. And I thank the former Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps and the current president of the USO, Gen. Carl Mundy, for spearheading this effort.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the amendment by Senator D'Amato to add funding for the support services for seniors to the additional funding. They perform a very vital service as places for seniors to gather and to have their meals and to carry out the purposes of the legislation to improve the quality of life in the golden years; and especially in the context where senior benefits have come under such attack, so much concern that I heard, for example, in my travels through Pennsylvania, where there is concern about the solidity of Social Security and what is happening with Medicare. I believe it is a wise course to make an allocation from administrative costs across the board, to add the funding in the D'Amato amendment. 
We have funded, last year, some $300,556,000. The administration made a request to cut that funding to $291,375,000. Our Senate markup, agreed to by Senator Harkin and myself in our committee and in the full committee, was $305,556,000. So, instead of dropping the amount by more than $9 million as the administration had requested, we put an additional $5 million in. On reflection, hearing the arguments of the Senator from New York, Senator D'Amato, I think that the addition of this $40 million is well placed, so I lend my voice in support of the pending amendment. 
Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from New York on the floor. I see him reaching for the microphone.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the issue now pending exists on complexity on a number of levels. 
I agree with the remarks just made by our distinguished majority leader that the American people ought not to pay for union elections. It is an open question as to how the consent decree was entered into when it was, and why the U.S. Government entered into that consent decree. But that is what we face at the present time. 
My view is that we have a question of judicial authority here which is paramount, and it is a matter for the court to decide under our doctrine of separation of powers. 
We are very premature in what we are doing here on two scores. 
One is there has been a recommendation for a new election, which, as I understand the record, has not yet been approved in the court. This is a complicated matter. There are lots of complexities on it. But my understanding is that it has not been approved by the court. And then the court under any expected interpretation would come to the conclusion that this is a new election, and not to be paid by the Treasury of the United States under the preexisting arrangement. That election has already been paid for. But essentially this a matter for the court to decide. And there would be ample time for the Congress to turn down an appropriation in the future on the basis that is not an appropriate matter to be paid for by taxpayers' money. But on this state of the record, it is my view that it is a judicial matter, and not a matter of the Congress.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, starting yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, in conjunction with scheduling from the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the ranking member on this subcommittee, Senator Harkin, we asked that amendments be brought with the hope of concluding action on this bill today, and that all amendments be submitted, first, by the end of business yesterday or no later than noon today. We have not had a great deal of business. 
The one exception would be an amendment which would deal with prohibiting Federal funding for testing, which the administration has in mind. Congressman Goodling had announced his intention to seek that kind of prohibition in the House. 
There had been comments yesterday that someone would offer that kind of legislation on the Senate side. The distinguished presiding officer, Senator Judd Gregg, said, with a pointed finger, it was he. I don't want to name names here, but I am prepared to identify those who are willing to be identified. 
I received a telephone call from the Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, yesterday afternoon, as did Senator Harkin and others. It seems to me that might be one matter we might put over until tomorrow and schedule the hearing at 9 o'clock to find the specifics as to whether that ought to be done. There is a sense that testing, in general, would be a good idea, but maybe it ought not to be done by the Federal Government. There is a great deal of concern about having the Federal Government move into the field of education. So we are going to move ahead at that time. 
Mr. President, I intend to offer an amendment later this afternoon calling for a sense of the Senate for the appointment of independent counsel. Although that is obviously not germane to an appropriations bill on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education, it is a practice in the Senate, with some repetition, to offer extraneous amendments, certainly sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. 
I had stated my intention to deal with this issue last July 24 and spoke extensively on the Senate floor on the appropriations bill pending at that time about my concern that independent counsel ought to be appointed based on the state of the record. Then when it was apparent that would tie up that bill, and the majority leader and the minority leader both wanted to move ahead, I said on July 25 that I would not pursue this sense-of-the-Senate resolution at that time and waited an additional month. 
I do believe that we urgently need appointment of independent counsel at the present time. I base that judgment on a series of letters which have been written by a variety of Members of Congress to the Attorney General, and she has declined to do so--a formal letter written by the majority members of the Judiciary Committee calling on the Attorney General to appoint independent counsel, and she has declined to do so. 
Then we had extensive hearings last April 30 on the Judiciary Committee where I questioned Attorney General Reno about the withholding of information from the President on national security matters, 
which appear to me to be a highly questionable thing to do, and that the President was publicly quoted saying that those national security matters had been withheld from him and he thought he should have been given access to those matters. 
In our constitutional Government it is my judgment that the rule is plain, that those are matters for the President as long as he is the President. There are ways to alter his status as President, but as long as he is the President, it is not up to an appointed Attorney General to make the decision that the President does not get national security information because, as the Attorney General testified, he was a potential suspect in a pending investigation. The damage about such a disclosure to a potential subject, in my view, is far, far less dangerous than having national security information withheld from the President of the United States. 
But it did seem to me that in that context that if the matter was serious enough to withhold information from the President, that certainly the independent counsel statute ought to be triggered. That is the statute which provides for an independent lawyer to come in and handle the case where it involves certain levels of Federal Government enumerated officials such as the President and the Vice President and Cabinet officers, especially in the context where Attorney General Reno testified in her confirmation hearings about her view of the importance of independent counsel. 
There is also the question about the advertisements. According to Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, and also Dick Morris, the President's political adviser, advertisements had been edited, drafted, essentially written by the President himself. There would be no question that there would be coordination in violation of the Federal statute prohibiting coordination if those in fact were advocacy commercials. We went through the commercials with the Attorney General. This was done on both sides. But the ones that were edited by the President extolled the President's virtues and decried his opponent's alleged failings, but fell short of saying vote for x or vote against y. By any reasonable standard, those were advocacy commercials, but they were viewed as being instead issue commercials and did not constitute a violation of the statute which prohibits coordination. 
Well, that plus a great many other factors, I think, have set the stage for the need for independent counsel. We have had disclosures in this morning's Washington Post about funds being raised by the Vice President which were hard money and not soft money. The Attorney General had previously said that if it is soft money it is not a contribution under the Federal election laws, a judgment or interpretation which is inexplicable, in my opinion. It is a contribution nonetheless. 
Hundreds of millions of dollars were put into the campaigns on both sides, Democrats and Republicans. But now there has been the forceful allegation made, information that a good bit of the money raised by the Vice President was hard money, and that would take away the last vestige as to what Attorney General Reno had said justified her refusal to appoint independent counsel. 
So it is my intention, Mr. President, to call for a vote on this amendment that I send to the desk at this time so that it may be filed and reviewed by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Later this afternoon I do intend to offer it, and in fact had thought I would offer it when I sought recognition. But I see my colleague, Senator Dorgan, has come to the floor. I understand he intends to offer an amendment of his own. So I will defer offering this amendment at this time, but I will speak about it to this extent, to put my colleagues on notice that this issue will be on the floor at the conclusion of the Dorgan amendment. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor so my colleague, Senator Dorgan, may proceed. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from North Dakota for offering this amendment. I agree with him about the importance of additional funding for pulmonary research, for heart research. It is a major killer in the United States. We ought to be doing everything we can to investigate, find cures and implement them. 
The amendment which has been offered carries an offset on administration and it has been modified from what the Senator from North Dakota had originally suggested, which would have been earmarking, which poses problems, because we do not earmark but instead leave that designation to the National Institutes of Health so we do not have excessive management or micromanagement by the Congress as to what the NIH funds must have. I think Senator Dorgan made a forceful statement that those funds ought to be directed in that way, and the officials at NIH will have that before them. I am confident they will make every effort they can to carry out the intent with which my colleague has expressed here. 
We have vast sums of money at NIH. We are increasing it. It is $952 million now, and is up to $13.7 billion. Notwithstanding all that funding, there are many applications which are not granted. This one expresses what the Senator from North Dakota thinks ought to be done. 
I am advised Senator Harkin is off the floor now attending a committee meeting and necessarily absent, but I am advised by his staff that Senator Harkin finds this amendment acceptable, as do I, as manager for the majority. We accept the amendment. 
I urge its adoption.

Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, as noted, that $2 million will be utilized from an existing fund for a demonstration project to test the effectiveness of providing attendant care services to individuals with disabilities, regardless of age. 
Every State in the country currently provides long-term services to eligible individuals who require the assistance of an attendant in nursing homes or other institutions. However, under a curious provision of the current Medicaid law, these individuals are not guaranteed the right to remain in their own homes and communities while receiving the assistance of an attendant as an alternative to institutional care.

Mr. SPECTER. The amendment that I am introducing today directs the Department to test the cost effectiveness of this policy option to allow the disabled to remain at home and to obtain the Federal Medicaid benefits. It is clear that the current long-term care system is highly regulated and very costly. It is my thought that there is a clear-cut need for a program to be put into effect which will enable the disabled to stay at home or in the community as an alternative to institutional care. 
On February 17 of this year, I had the privilege of visiting a group of disabled individuals, many of whom have substantial disabilities, struggling to live independent lives. They gave me a sweatshirt, and I now display it for my colleagues and for those on C-Span II, showing, `Our Homes, Not Nursing Homes.' And it is the symbol of someone who is disabled. 
When I met with these individuals, who were struggling in their wheelchairs, with enormous disabilities, and found that they could not receive Medicaid benefits unless they were in an institution, it seemed to me manifestly unfair. It is clear that it would be less costly to have the disabled remain in their communities or in their own homes so they could care for themselves and could receive the Medicaid benefits. 
So I said to these people in North Philadelphia that I would bring the matter to the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the view of having an administrative change. But I find that it is very complicated because the preliminary estimates from the Congressional Budget Office say that this would be an enormously expensive change to enable the disabled to have benefits to live in their communities or in their homes. 
I wondered why. The best explanation which I have been able to receive so far is that, at the present time, these people, the disabled, are cared for by their relatives, by friends or somehow by themselves because they don't want to go into an institution, so they forgo the assistance which Medicaid offers the disabled. The Congressional Budget Office asserts that if these individuals were to have the ability to have this care outside of the institution, the costs would skyrocket. 
It seems to me, Madam President, unfair that where the Medicaid law says the disabled are entitled to certain benefits if they are in an institution, that they should be compelled to be institutionalized when they want to live in their homes or their own communities. This is quite a conundrum, quite a Catch-22. So the best course that I see at the present time would be for us to undertake this program on a test basis, and to have a study, made to see what the costs would be in order to try to arrive at some fair determination. 
Exhibit 1 U.S. SENATE, 
Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC, February 28, 1997. 
Hon. Donna Shalala, Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC. 
Dear Secretary Shalala: I am writing to alert you that I intend to raise with your at next week's Subcommittee hearing a matter concerning Medicaid coverage of attendant care services for people with disabilities. 
It has been brought to my attention that considerable savings to the Medicaid program could be achieved by redirecting long-term care funding toward community-based attendant services, and by requiring States to develop attendant service programs meeting national standards to assure that people of all ages with disabilities have full access to such services. Please be prepared to summarize the current status of Medicaid services to the disabled population, and to discuss your views on establishing a national program of community-based attendant services. I would also appreciate your thoughts on what further could be done, both administratively and through legislative action, to better enable people with mental and physical disabilities to live independently. 
I look forward to discussing this and other issues with you next Tuesday when you appear to present the Administration's fiscal year 1998 budget request for your Department. 
My best. 
Sincerely,

Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, now briefly addressing the amendments offered by Senator Gregg and Senator Coats, it is my hope that the amendments will be debated today for all those who have views and care to express them; that is, as I said earlier, because this is a complicated matter. In my conversation yesterday in a telephone call which I received from the Secretary of Education, he asked for my support, and I told him that I did not know enough about the matter to render a judgment and had said earlier it seems to me that testing is desirable, but I do not know that it ought to be undertaken by the Federal Government. 
We have scheduled a hearing tomorrow which we have advanced from 9 o'clock to 8:30 in the morning because we have since had a request from Congressman Goodling to testify at the hearing. So we are now going to have the Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, we are going to have the chairman of the House Education Committee, and we are looking, as a matter of balance, to find someone in opposition to the Department of Education program. So that hearing will be conducted from 8:30, hopefully until 10 a.m. It is my hope that we will complete action on the remainder of this bill today, with the exception of the vote on the Gregg amendment, and take that up tomorrow. 
Madam President, I now call up amendment No. 1069.

Before suggesting the absence of a quorum, let me say that we had talked earlier about having a vote on the Kyl mendment at 5 o'clock this afternoon. We have not yet locked in that amendment, but it is now being hot lined. It is my expectation that we will vote at 5 o'clock this afternoon on the Kyl amendment. 
I now ask, Madam President, that anybody who opposes the sense-of-the-Senate resolution for independent counsel come to speak, anybody who favors it come to speak, or if somebody has another amendment, come to speak. We will be glad to set this aside and proceed with the business. 
We also ask there be a hot line looking for a unanimous consent agreement later this afternoon, perhaps early evening, 6 o'clock, 6:30, to limit any further amendments which may be offered so that we may get a calendar as to what we are going to do on this bill to proceed to third reading and final disposition, because it is the intention of the managers to move for third reading if no other amendments are pending.

We have worked within the subcommittee to increase the funding for the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke which included language in the Senate report highlighting the importance of further activity on Parkinson's disease research. And the activities of the sponsors of this amendment, whom I commend, will direct greater intensive effort on Parkinson's, which is a horrible disease. It has afflicted many, many people. 
With the enactment of this amendment, I think we will be taking a firm stand to show the emphasis that the Senate, hopefully, ultimately the full Congress, will place on additional research and resources being directed against Parkinson's. 
There is a great deal that could be said. We have a number of other amendments, so I will limit my comments to those brief remarks.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, yesterday I had announced our hope to be able to conclude this bill by this evening. Senator Lott was on the floor when we were talking about scheduling and I discussed it briefly with our distinguished majority leader, and also with Senator Harkin, the ranking Democrat, and asked that anybody who intended to file amendments to let us know by the close of business yesterday, or in any event no later than noon today. We have been advised of a number of possible amendments. I believe it is possible to work some of those out. Others will have to go to votes. 
But I would restate at this time our urging anybody who intends to file an amendment to contact us by noon today so that we may proceed. There is one item which may not be completed by the close of business today, and that relates to the funding on testing which is now proposed by the administration. 
There was a statement in the media by Congressman William Goodling of Pennsylvania, chairman of their authorization committee, of his intention to oppose funding. And there was comment that a similar prohibition may be offered on this bill. 
Yesterday I was contacted by the Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, who urged support of their program, and we had a discussion. After sleeping on it I decided it would be a good idea to have a hearing on the subject, which we have put into effect for tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock, with the concurrence of Senator Harkin and also our chairman of the appropriations committee, Senator Stevens. So, if that amendment is offered, that one item of business might most appropriately be concluded tomorrow morning. But aside from that one item, it is my hope that we will be able to finish action on this bill this evening. 
I thank my colleague, Senator Kyl, for offering his amendment yesterday. 
I yield the floor so that Senator Kyl may proceed.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with 50 percent of what the distinguished Senator from Arizona has said; that is, the part about the increasing Pell grants. I think he is exactly right about that. I wish we had more money to increase the Pell grants. 
What we have done is to increase the Pell grants by $1 billion. It has moved from fiscal year 1997 where it was at $5.919 billion to $6.910 billion which is a very, very substantial increase--in the 16- to 17-percent range. 
Senator Harkin and I, who have looked over these figures, take second place to no one on our concern for education and that created in the budget we have here, and what we have done over the years--most notably last April when we added $2.6 billion over some very considerable objection and instead having those funds go largely to education. 
As I said yesterday, on a very personal level, my concern about education goes to the roots of my own family. Both of my parents were immigrants. And my brother, my two sisters, and I have been able to share in the American dream because of our educational opportunities. 
We have not only added to the Pell grants the $1 billion here but have also increased the funding on guaranteed student loans so that every young man and woman--and this goes for the people who are not quite so young--would have an opportunity for educational advancement in this country. 
So that I agree totally with what my distinguished colleague from Arizona has had to say about the value of the Pell grants. But we have stretched and stretched very, very far. 
It is true that the House has an additional $500 million in the Pell grants, and they have a larger sum of money to work with than we are allocated in the Senate. Without going into any extensive explanation, there are different technical rules which apply to the two bodies. 
I might say to my colleague from Arizona that with the additional arguments he has advanced today in a very cogent way, to the extent we can yield to the House figure, we will try to do so when we get to conference, recognizing his interest and being even more persuaded by his eloquence here this morning. 
The part of his presentation that I cannot agree with is the part relating to cutting the funding on low-income heat and energy fuel assistance. What we have done here, Mr. President, for those who may be listening in-house or on C-SPAN 2, is made an allocation of the almost $80 billion here by trying to place the funding on a priority basis, and having taken care of other priorities including Pell grants with the additional $1 billion, have made the allocation of $1 billion to the LIHEAP 1998 program and an advanced appropriation of $1.2 billion, which is slightly different. 
This program is on the decline from 1985 when it had $2.1 billion. We believe that this is an appropriate allocation of priorities. Some 55 Senators have written to Senator Harkin and myself asking that LIHEAP be preserved. If you add 55 to 2, that is 57, and there may be some other votes out there. 
I make this comment not to prejudge the tabulation of the votes, because you never know until the votes are counted, but there are 57 Senators who have been concerned enough about this one item who have spoken up--55 having written to us. And I can tell you how strongly Senator Harkin and I feel about this. I know obviously my own sense of it, and I have talked to Senator Harkin enough to know his sense. 
This program is for low-income families. Almost 70 percent of the recipient families have an annual income of less than $8,000--think of that, $8,000; 44 percent have at least one member who is elderly, and 20 percent have a member disabled. Currently, the number of families served has been reduced to 5 million families, 1 million less than 2 years ago, and this is part of our effort to target those who need it the most. The funding has been cut by more than 50 percent, from $2.1 billion to this figure. There is no replacement for this funding. 
Thirty-five percent of all recipient households heat their homes by using oil, propane, wood, or coal. These sources of fuel do not have a monopoly control over their territories and cannot raise prices to cover the cost of providing discounted or free energy supplies to their low-income members. What we really face here is that in this category, many of the elderly, many of the disabled are faced with an alternative of either heating or eating, and that is a choice obviously that no American should face. 
Without LIHEAP, there would not be an opportunity for these low-income families to utilize their other scarce resources for sustaining themselves. Obviously, in a civilized society, if the choice is heating or eating, we have to do both, and that is why this funding is so very important.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as is usually the case, there are absent Senators, one not due to return until 1 o'clock. We then have a conference until 2:15. Then there are hearings. So it will be our expectation, subject to checking with the distinguished majority leader, that the vote on this amendment would occur at 5 o'clock. But it would be our expectation that this would conclude the debate on the amendment. It wouldn't absolutely foreclose somebody who wanted to come down and speak on the matter, perhaps, briefly, but that would conclude the debate and we would hope to set the vote here for 5 o'clock and perhaps stack it with other votes at that time.

Mr. SPECTER. If my distinguished colleague will yield, Mr. President, I think that would be a good arrangement. I said earlier, repeating what we said yesterday, it is our hope to finish action on this bill this evening. That is what we said yesterday after concurring with the majority leader. There is one possible exception to that, and that would relate to a possible amendment to preclude any funding for the administration testing, and an issue arose yesterday as to whether that amendment might be offered. Secretary Riley called Senator Harkin, myself and others yesterday, and we have scheduled a hearing for tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock so that we may have a better factual understanding on that matter before the vote comes up, if it does come up. It would be our hope we can conclude action on the bill this evening, with the exception of that possible vote following the hearing tomorrow morning. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside so that we might receive an amendment by the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, on a matter which I believe is acceptable to both sides. This involves an issue which has been resolved after laborious debates on related subjects, and it is one where the House of Representatives has worked out an accommodation. The amendment will now be offered by our colleague from Missouri.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment conforms the provisions of the Hyde amendment, which were developed for fee-for-service, so that the same limitations would apply on Medicaid, on managed care. 
This has been a very controversial issue for many years and has taken up the attention of this Chamber and the House of Representatives. After many votes and a lot of deliberation and a lot of negotiations, the Hyde amendment has been crafted in its existing form as it applies to fee-for-service, and this carries it forward to managed care. 
I am advised that in the House of Representatives they have worked through this same amendment and have made the request, through their staff, that we have it accepted here. We had intended to put it in a managers' package. I have conferred with my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, who is on the floor at the present time. The distinguished Senator from Missouri discussed it with the managers and sought to offer it in the form that it has been offered and to make a statement. I think that concludes the matter in a way that has existed for many, many years as an accommodation of many complex and conflicting issues. 
Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Harkin and I are now looking for business. A solicitation, I believe, is appropriate under these circumstances. As we had announced yesterday and today, it is our hope we will finish this bill today. We ask that any Senator who intends to offer an amendment to let us know by noon today. 
There may be one amendment which we cannot complete today. That involves the limitation of funding on testing proposed by the administration. As I had said earlier, Congressman Goodling has stated publicly his intention to offer such an amendment on the House appropriations bill. It had been suggested that a similar amendment be offered on this bill. 
Secretary of Education Riley contacted Senator Harkin and I, and others, yesterday on this subject. Senator Harkin and I, in collaboration with our committee chairman, Senator Stevens, have scheduled a hearing tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock. So if that vote is to occur on the bill, it would occur after we have been informed on some of the specifics of the administration's proposal. 
So we are now looking for amendments. 
In the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are prepared now to proceed with consideration of the legislation on appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. 
I have just conferred with my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, the ranking Democrat, after having conferred with the majority leader, and it is our plan to complete action on this bill by tomorrow evening, Wednesday evening. That is not to say that the plan will conclusively be fulfilled as of that time, but it is our plan to proceed in that manner. 
It would be our hope that we would have a firm idea of all the amendments which would be offered by the end of business today or if not, no later than noon tomorrow, since we are scheduled to have a vote tomorrow morning at 9:30, and as is the custom, Senators will be arriving today. Some are obviously present now, but as our practice has demonstrated in the past, when the rollcall vote is taken, Senators will be present. 
We have had some substantial period of time--obviously, slightly more than a month--to prepare for this bill, because the majority leader announced at the conclusion of our session on July 31-August 1, that this would be the first order of business taken up. 
I recall the comment of then majority leader Howard Baker on some legislation back in 1982, when we had a tax bill on the floor of the Senate and the question was whether we were going to proceed all night, which Senator Baker was wont to do, or whether we would go into the next morning. I recall Senator Baker said that amendments, like mushrooms, grew overnight, and it was his determination to proceed that evening. I remember there were about 70 amendments pending. Senator Dole was the manager of the bill. It was a tax bill. We proceeded all night and finished action about 6:30 in the morning. 
Well, there has been more time than overnight for these amendments, like mushrooms, to grow, but we have a bill here which is very important. 
There is a lot of business in the Senate, and speaking from a personal note, we will be moving ahead with hearings on the Governmental Affairs Committee on campaign finance reform, and I serve on that committee. I hope to be finished with this bill by tomorrow night, whatever time it takes to proceed with the other work of the Governmental Affairs Committee.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, moving now to consideration of the pending bill, the pending committee report, we have legislation before the Senate for the three departments, the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education for fiscal year 1998, which totals $79.7 billion in discretionary budget authority. That is a large sum of money. Mandatory spending under this totals $189.3 billion, which is a decrease of $15.2 billion from the fiscal year 1997 levels. 
We have gone through the budget with great care. We have been fortunate enough to have outstanding staffs, both on the Republican side of the aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle, and we have come forward with these proposals here today. It is my view, Mr. President, that when we have a total Federal budget of $1.7 trillion, that should provide for the needs of the American people through the Federal Governmental operations, if we assess our priorities in a proper way. We have just seen landmark legislation with the balanced budget legislation, and the tax reduction legislation passed by the Congress before we adjourned on August 1, and signed by the President into law on August 5. It is very important that we do reach that balanced budget. We should not, as a nation, spend beyond our means. I believe it is possible to achieve that goal if we work with a scalpel and not a meat ax and take care of the important needs for all of America. 
We deal here with the subjects of health and education and there are no priorities higher than those two items. The people of America, the people of the United States, should be healthy and there should be educational opportunities so people should have an opportunity to climb the ladder in America. 
When I talk of education, I talk from a very keen sense personally of education as an opportunity which I have seen. Both of my parents were immigrants. My father literally walked across Europe from Russia, barely a ruble in his pocket, at the age of 18 in 1911 to make a new life for himself and the family which he hoped to have and did have. My mother, coming with her parents to the United States from a small town on the Russian-Polish border at the age of 5, education was heavily emphasized in the Specter household because our parents had so little of it. My brother, my two sisters, and I have been able to share in the American dream because of that educational opportunity. 
As Senator Harkin and I and our staffs have crafted this legislation, we have done our utmost to provide for that educational opportunity. We have provided for increases in the maximum Pell grant to $3,000 per year. We have provided for guaranteed student loans. It would be preferable if we could provide scholarships for all young people, and older people who want additional education, but that is not possible in a practical sense, so we have a revolving sum where at least the education can be obtained, even if there are obligations that would have to be paid at a later time. 
We have come to this budget with very deep concerns over the issue of health. Regrettably, when the budget resolution was presented to us, there was a cut of some $100 million on discretionary health spending which required a considerable reallocation of priorities, which Senator Harkin and I and our subcommittee and then the full committee and our staffs have undertaken. That was especially problemsome when it came to the issue of the National Institutes of Health where it was our desire to continue to increase the funding on medical research which has been so marvelous for America 
and our advances benefiting the entire world. 
Early in the 105th session, we passed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, or a sense-of-the-Senate resolution was introduced and, I believe, passed--we will check the Record on that to be sure--to double NIH funding over 5 years. If it wasn't passed, the sense-of-the-Senate resolutions pass pretty easily around here because they talk about our druthers as opposed to our dollars. Then, when we took up the budget resolution, and a sense-of-the-Senate resolution passed to increase NIH funding by some $2 billion. Then Senator Harkin and I offered an amendment to increase it--not a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, but hard dollars of $1.1 billion. That would have left us with a net of about $950 million to achieve the 7.5-percent increase Senator Harkin and I committed to early in the session for the NIH. 
When we brought that amendment to the floor, it was roundly defeated 63-37, which was somewhat disappointing. But it was an illustration of what happens in the Senate when you have a sense of the Senate, which is an expression of what you would like to see, or druthers, as opposed to a hard amendment which puts up money. And when we balance the budget, if we put up 7.5 percent, which is $952 million, we have to have someplace to take it from. When that choice is made, it isn't too easy to get the votes. That amendment went down to defeat, as I said, 63-37. But then we went back to the drawing boards with our sharp pencils--mainly staff's sharp pencils--and figured out a way on the allocation of priorities to find that 7.5 percent, or $952 million, and we did find it. It was not easy to do, but we thought that that was what ought to be done. 
In the United States, it is my view that we have the best health care system in the world, but it continues to need improvement. I personally was the beneficiary of that health care system about 4 years ago when an MRI detected a life-threatening problem that I had, and I was able to get my medical situation corrected. There is nothing like having a problem and using the MRI personally to do a little research to find out about its development. I was surprised to find that it had only been developed in 1984, less than a decade before I found the need to use it. 
Within the course of the past week, I had occasion to return to my home State of Kansas for my 50th high school reunion. I probably should not have given the date. I may get leave to amend and revise the Congressional Record on that. Just kidding. It was my 50th high school reunion. My Aunt Rose Isemberg, in Wichita, who is 85, was the beneficiary of a serious operation and is well on her way to recovery. I focused on that factor and mentioned to my Aunt Rose that in some countries you can't get an operation when you are that old. In some countries you can't get one if you are past 60. So we have a marvelous health system in the United States, but, again, one which needs improvement. 
When I returned to my hometown of Russell, KS, to my high school reunion, I was reminiscing with my sister-in-law, Joyce Specter, about the medical care in Russell, KS. My brother had some serious ailments several years ago, and I was with him. Unfortunately, he passed away. Back then, I wanted to talk to Dr. Merkel, and it was 6:45 on a Saturday night. I asked for his home number and I was told, `You can't call Dr. Merkel at home at 6:45 on a Saturday. You will find him in the office.' 
Notwithstanding our graduations of doctors and medical experts, rural America still doesn't have as much by way of health care providers as rural America needs. So we do have significant improvements to be made in our health system in America. This is something which we have focused on as we have moved ahead in this bill and our efforts to provide health care coverage for all Americans. 
Again, on a personal note, I was fascinated to hear of the health coverage offered by Israel, without regard for preexisting conditions or without regard for age--a factor called to my attention by my sister, Hilda Morgenstern, and my brother-in-law, Arthur Morgenstern, who have dual citizenship in the United States and in Israel. There are examples around the world as we try to extend health coverage and services to the 37 to 41 million Americans who are not now covered. It is appropriate to note that in the reconciliation bill we passed, the Balanced Budget Act, we have taken action to provide some $24 billion to cover America's uninsured children, numbering about 10 million. There is a question, as we work through the program, as to how many of those children we will be able to cover. 
Mr. President, during the course of our deliberations, Senator Harkin and I received requests from Members, totaling more than 700 such requests, for expanded funding for programs within the subcommittee's jurisdiction, and, to the maximum extent possible, we tried to honor those requests. We had very substantial support for increasing the funding for the National Institutes of Health and, as noted, we have done that with an increase of 7.5 percent, some $952 million. So that now we have nearly $13.7 billion for the National Institutes of Health, and their achievements have been near miraculous as they have moved ahead with research on breast cancer, ovarian cancer--very serious ailments for women--and prostate cancer for men, Alzheimer's disease--very substantial advances in research there--mental health research, research on heart conditions, and virtually every known ailment that has come within the scope of the National Institutes of Health. 
One of the really educational experiences that I personally have had on the job as chairman of the subcommittee is we have received so many requests from so many people around the United States who have ailments that I had never heard about. I do believe that we have a budget which can accommodate research along those lines. If this recommendation is insufficient, I believe the Congress of the United States is prepared, on a priority basis, to allocate whatever it takes on medical research in the United States to do the job. Even with that kind of a funding, there are many applications which are not granted. We have moved ahead very substantially in the time that I have been in the Senate, whether the chairman was Senator Weicker, later Governor Weicker, or Senator Chiles, later Governor Chiles, or whether Senator Harkin was chairman, or during my chairmanship. 
The committee has placed a very high priority on women's health. The bill provides for increased funding. There will be funding for expanded programs to develop mental health care services for women, to provide moneys for a comprehensive review of the impact of heart disease on women, where in the past less attention was paid to that important item. Women do have different problems, very different from men, when it comes to heart ailments. For so many years, the research had been on men alone. The additional funding will help launch an osteoporosis public education program aimed at teenagers. 
In our legislation, we have provided funding for both family planning and for abstinence programs. One of the most controversial issues facing America is the controversy of pro-choice/pro-life. But there is one item that can be generally agreed upon, and that is if we can cut down on premarital sex among teenagers and unintended pregnancies, and the abortions which follow, that is an objective where there is general agreement, and we have produced additional funding here for those programs devoted to abstention. 
One of the items on which we continue to increase funding is our program on Healthy Start. That is an initiative to try to give prenatal care to women and avoid having low-birthweight babies. I saw my first 1-pound baby at Alma Illery Medical Facility in Pittsburgh more than a decade ago, and I was shocked to see a child no bigger than my hand, which weighed less than a pound. When you have a child with that low birthweight, there are medical problems that last a lifetime and enormous costs to society. Those children frequently cost as much as $300,000 by the time they are out of the hospital in a few weeks or a few months. Thousands are born each year. It is a multibillion-dollar expense. The program of prenatal care has had great results and is one which we are pushing ahead in the legislation pending. 
The issue of AIDS continues to be a matter of overwhelming importance in the United States. Today's front page of the Washington Post is devoted significantly to it. Our bill contains some $3.265 billion for research, education, prevention, and services, including an $81 million increase for the Ryan White CARE Program, named after the young man who developed AIDS on a blood transfusion--nothing at fault even remotely there. This issue continues to be of enormous importance in the United States. 
Our legislation provides further assistance in funding for substance abuse, both alcohol and drugs, a major problem in our country. 
We have taken the initiative with some $50 million for new programs to assist communities in preventing juvenile crime. That is an issue of great concern in the United States and one which falls partially within the jurisdiction of our subcommittee. It is not inappropriate to note at this time that pending before the Judiciary Committee is extensive legislation on juvenile crime. It is my hope that we will craft a bill, when the issue comes to the floor of the U.S. Senate, which will take into account not only tough measures to try juveniles as adults, where they are, in fact, adults by size or inclination and prior record, but also to work on the literacy training and job training. 
Based on the experience I have had on the Judiciary Committee, and before that as district attorney of Philadelphia, it is my view that we can control violent crime in America if we approach it at two levels. One, where we have career criminals, to have life sentences. The armed career criminal bill that I offered, which passed back in 1984, has made a significant effort in that regard. Where you have a career criminal with three or more violent offenses, now, by Federal law, there is a mandatory sentence in the Federal courts of 15 years to life. We have been putting more people in jail, and there has been a decrease in the crime rate. In my judgment, that is attributable to the factor that there are more violent criminals now in prison. The other half of the equation, though, is to provide realistic rehabilitation for those who are not career criminals, where they are going to be released. It is no surprise that if you have a functional illiterate without a trade or skill, a person who goes back onto the street without training, without a job, that person is likely to go through the revolving door and become a recidivist. 
That is why one of the first bills I introduced when I came to the Senate, alongside the armed career criminal bill, was legislation for realistic rehabilitation, for job training and literacy training. As we craft that juvenile crime bill, it is my hope that we will have an appropriate balance on the juveniles, on literacy training and job training, because we know that 1 day they are going to be released from jail. A societal option is either to have them as law-abiding citizens, working their way and contributing to society, or becoming criminals. So it is in the interest of law-abiding citizens, as well as the individuals themselves, that appropriate attention be given to literacy training and job training. 
Also included in this bill is our allocation of funding for Head Start. Some $4.3 billion is included here, which is an increase of some $324 million. We increase the number of children by 36,000, to a total of 836,000, on our planned route to having 1 million covered by Head Start by the year 2002. 
Also in our budget is funding to protect women against violence 
when we talk about the categories of battered women's shelters, rape prevention, runaway youth prevention, domestic violence community demonstrations, and the domestic violence hotline. 
Another important item--controversial, as many are in this bill--is our program on low-income heat and energy fuel assistance. We have maintained funding of some $1 billion for this winter, and advanced funding of $1.2 billion for next year's winter program. This is a program which is controversial because in some States the needs are not as great as they are in other States. But what we have essentially for many Americans, especially elderly Americans, is a choice on either heating or eating. With many elderly in the program with annual incomes of $8,000 or less, they are totally unable to cope without some assistance on fuel costs. 
We also have within this bill important programs for the elderly, including community service employment programs, part-time employment opportunities for low-income elderly, home delivered nutrition services, and the National Senior Volunteer Corps. 
We have as well school-to-work where there is a transition moving from school to work, coordinated also with the job training programs and Job Corps which provide educational opportunities and vocational training for those young people in our society who may not prefer that to the college education and may be more appropriately directed in that line. 
On education, Mr. President, we have moved ahead with an increase of some $3.1 billion in our discretionary education funds. 
I especially commend my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, for his leadership in this very, very important line. 
We have had difficulties in bringing this particular bill to the floor in the past. It was not until April 1996 when we were able to--after an amendment offered by Senator Harkin and myself to increase funding for this subcommittee by $2.6 billion --move ahead. 
I commend the President for his initiatives and priority setting on education, which is, as I noted earlier, a priority second to none for the United States. 
In this line, we have special education programs funded at some $921 million. And I commend the chairman of the Educational Opportunities Committee in the House, my colleague, Bill Goodling from Pennsylvania, and also our colleague, Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, for their leadership in this item where we are trying to maintain the Federal commitment to special education. We are coming very close to the high marks set in S. 1. Again, it is a matter of establishing priorities, which we have done here. 
On our student aid programs, the bill provides some $8.5 billion, which is an increase of almost $1 billion--$997.3 million over last year's appropriations. The Pell grant is going up by some $300 to a maximum grant of $3,000. The Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants Program is increased by some $51 million. 
I go into some detail for at least two reasons, Mr. President. These are important programs, and we are not taking up anybody's time, Senator Harkin and I being the only two Senators on the floor. I will yield in a few minutes for Senator Harkin's opening comments. 
On job training, we have provided $5.2 billion for the job training programs, which is more than $500 million over the 1997 level. That includes increases for Job Corps, adult training, and training for dislocated workers, which is a very, very important problem for Americans, especially in my home State of Pennsylvania where we have seen the demise of the steel industry and the coal industry and the glass industry. 
So many of the problems of the dislocated workers are caused by imports which are coming into the United States, which really ought not to be coming into the United States, where we are dealing with concerns on defense policy or on foreign policy. And so many American workers are taking it on the chin. The least we can do is to have retraining for the dislocated workers. 
Our bill provides very important funding for worker safety programs in the Department of Labor where we are now providing almost $1 billion--just $1 million short; $999 million--for worker safety programs. This is an increase of some $37 million above 1997's level for worker safety activities. 
Mr. President, I have gone over, believe it or not, just a few of the highlights of this bill, which totals almost $80 billion. We have in excess of $11 billion for the Department of Labor, almost $32 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services, and almost $30 billion on the Department of Education, coming to a total of almost $80 billion in discretionary funding. 
To repeat, Mr. President, on the schedule, which the majority leader and Senator Harkin and I have discussed earlier, it would be our plan--our optimistic plan, but our plan nonetheless--to conclude action on this bill by tomorrow night. We would like to have all amendments filed by the close of business today and, in any event, no later than noon tomorrow. All the Senators will be here, as we have every expectation for the vote scheduled at 9:30 tomorrow so that we can make our plans and scheduling for any amendments which may be filed. 
At this time, I am pleased to yield to my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had referred earlier to the allocation of funding of the various Departments in fiscal year 1998 for the current bill, and the specific breakdown is as follows: Labor, $11 billion; Health and Human Services, $31.9 billion; Education, $29.3 billion; and related agencies, $7.5 billion; with the total being $79.7 billion. 
There is a long list of related agencies made a part of this bill, but illustrative of those agencies are agencies such as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Federal Mediation Conciliation Service, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, the Railroad Retirement Board. Those are illustrative of the agencies covered by the bill. I make that delineation to give those watching on C-SPAN 2 a fuller picture of what this bill covers, and for the Record.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, earlier this morning, when the majority leader and I were on the floor, with Senator Harkin, the ranking member of the subcommittee, we discussed the sequence of the bill which is currently pending, and it was our plan, our expectation, to conclude action on this bill by tomorrow evening. We have only had one amendment laid down so far. The distinguished Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] has laid down an amendment with respect to LIHEAP, but no other amendment has been forthcoming. 
Now is obviously a good time to offer amendments since the floor is clear, with ample time for consideration. We hope that anybody who has an amendment to offer would advise the managers of the bill, myself in my capacity as chairman of the subcommittee, and Senator Harkin, the ranking member of the subcommittee, and that we would have notification by the end of business today as to all amendments Members tend to offer. At the very latest we hope those amendments would be filed by noon tomorrow. We have a vote scheduled for 9:30, and Senators to some extent may be arriving back at this time. Certainly as an indicator from past practice Senators will be here tomorrow morning to vote at 9:30, so we hope that Senators would let us have those amendments so that we could plan the conclusion of the bill, sequence the amendments and try to conclude this bill by the end of business tomorrow, Wednesday night. 
I thank the Chair, and in the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator on the floor at the present time, I will utilize this occasion to discuss the open house town meetings which I held during the course of the past recess in August to share with my colleagues and those who may be watching on C-SPAN 2 some of the observations that I found in traveling in my State of Pennsylvania and in meeting with my citizens. 
I make it a point to have meetings in every one of the Pennsylvania counties as often as I can, and by the end of September, by the end of this month, I will have covered all of my 67 counties, something that I find very, very valuable. 
What I do as a matter of format--and I think this is similar to what many Senators do--is I make a very brief statement, as to what we have done, and then I throw the floor open for questions. Usually I get somewhere in the range of 15 to 20 questions. Regrettably, our mail allocation has been cut down. In prior years, it had been possible to send mail to our entire counties. That mail allocation has been reduced so that it is not possible to send mail to all of the counties. This is something which I think the Senate ought to give serious consideration to revising. I believe that we ought to be frugal when it comes to mailings which do have some political import, but where a Senator himself or herself goes out into a community to appear to make a presentation and respond to questions, I think that is the very essence of our democratic process. To the extent that the mail notifies people in a very direct way of the presence of a Senator coming into the community, my sense is that is well worth doing. 
The dominant theme that I found in traveling through Pennsylvania, Mr. President, was a dissatisfaction or a distrust of government. There is great cynicism in America today about what is going on in Washington, DC. It is my sense that unless you go out and actually talk to the people--and not just in shopping centers and not just casually, as we have our social contacts during the course of a recess period--that there is not a full understanding as to how much apathy, cynicism and outright distrust of our Government there is. I noted the Washington Post, on the 29th of August, just a few days ago, had on its front page a survey which noted `three out of four say they do not trust the Government or its leaders to do what is right.' 
My own findings would confirm that, as I have been in many open house town meetings during the course of the past month and throughout the past year. At one of my open house town meetings, one of the citizens was wearing a cap that had the word `militia' printed on it. There are many people in the militia in the United States today. How many exactly, we do not know. 
In my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, we had hearings concerning militias during the 104th Congress. We had Colonel Olson from the Michigan militia come in and speak in very unflattering terms about the Congress of the United States. 
There have been estimates into the millions as to how many militia members there are. 
And in one of my open house town meetings, the word `revolution' was used in expressing very grave disagreement with what the Government was doing, on this occasion the importation of sludge from New York and New Jersey to fill abandoned mines in Pennsylvania. And there is great concern in my State, as there is I think in this country generally, about limitations on so-called second amendment rights, and great distrust as to what the Government is doing. 
During the course of the past month, Ruby Ridge was again in the news with a report by the Department of Justice. The report stated that there would not be any prosecutions as to the investigation which had been conducted by the Department of Justice. This investigation lasted almost 2 years after it was initiated in the fall of 1995, a period of time which I think is unwarranted on the facts as I know them. 
I have had discussions with both the Attorney General and the U.S. attorney in charge of that investigation and will talk about that in some greater detail. After the Department of Justice report was issued, the prosecuting attorney in Boundary County, ID, returned an indictment against Special Agent Lon Horiuchi of the FBI on the charge of involuntary manslaughter on the killing of Mrs. Vicki Weaver which occurred in that confrontation back on August 21, 1992. 
The DA for Boundary County returned the indictment of murder in the first degree against Mr. Kevin Harris for the killing of Deputy Marshal William Degan. The incidents which we have seen in Waco and in Ruby Ridge have fanned, I think, really great distrust for the Government, something which we are going to have to address in greater detail. 
In my personal opinion, the Congress has not yet had appropriate oversight hearings on Waco, notwithstanding the fact that we have done something there. I think we have made a start on Ruby Ridge when the subcommittee which I chaired back in September and October of 1995, with 14 days of hearings, heard from about 60 witnesses and published a 150-page report. I intend to talk about that in greater detail on the floor of the Senate when we have some time, perhaps yet this afternoon. 
But I do want to comment about the grave concerns which I have found in my State about distrusting the Government and how the Ruby Ridge subject came up because it was very much in the news during the weeks of mid-August, August 13, 14, and 15, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. And I was in western and central Pennsylvania, August 20, 21, and 22 when I was again doing open house town meetings. 
I also found great concern in the open house town meetings I conducted about the way campaigns are financed. And I believe that the hearings we have had before the Governmental Affairs Committee during the month of July have resonated more in America than many people believed. It is unfortunate, I think, that there has not been more television coverage because that is the way the American people get most of their information these days. 
Only Fox has carried them live, the Fox cable channel. And CNN has covered to a slight extent, and C-SPAN has not covered them live but has replayed them. And there are many people who watch C-SPAN. Insomniacs are people who watch during the late hours of the night. You can probably catch the Governmental Affairs hearings if you watch at about 3 a.m. to see what is going on. But I found that many people have been watching them and were very concerned about what is going on. 
My view is that we ought to have campaign finance reform. And I voted for cloture last year to bring the legislation offered by Senator McCain and Senator Feingold to the floor. I believe that there is a difficulty with that particular piece of legislation on calling for television stations to give free time because I think that is a taking of property without compensation required by the fifth amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
But I have been working on legislation, some of which has been motivated by what I have seen in the Governmental Affairs hearing. I intend to talk about that as well, perhaps later this afternoon if there are no other Senators on the floor who come to offer amendments. 
I have also heard, Mr. President, considerable concern about what is happening with Social Security and Medicare. And regrettably there has been a practice of using those issues for campaign purposes, something done by both political parties. I do not suggest blame in what has been done in the campaign sense. But I think we would be better advised if we tailored our representations a little closer to what the facts are. 
But these open house town meetings are populated very significantly by our senior citizens who have more time to come to the open house town meetings. And perhaps there is greater interest among senior citizens in what is going on in Government because of Social Security and Medicare. 
But people are questioning whether Social Security is really secure. And my view is that it is. They are questioning about what is happening with Medicare. And I think the American people have not understood that when we have considered changes in Medicare that we have not sought to cut Medicare but instead to restrain the growth of Medicare. We have looked at an increase in funding for Medicare in excess of 10 percent a year. We have sought to reach compromise between Democrats and Republicans to restrain the growth somewhere in the 7-percent range, give or take a little. And that is two or three times the rate of inflation. But if we are to maintain Medicare, we are going to have to be able to pay for it and to contain the rate of growth on Medicare. 
I am pleased that we have established in the recent legislation a commission which will take up Medicare in some detail on a bipartisan basis to try to give assurance to the public that what we are doing here is sound governmentally and sound financially. It is not for political scare tactics. We had the Commission for Social Security back in 1983 which put Social Security on a solid basis. 
We had then Senator Pepper as a Member of the House, a very distinguished representative of senior citizens, someone the senior citizens had a lot of confidence in. We had a slight increase in the tax on Social Security and a slight delay in receiving benefits and put Social Security on a sound basis back in 1983. And it is my hope that we will be able to do that again. 
People want to know about a trust fund, why we do not have Social Security off budget. That I believe, Mr. President, is something we ought to be doing. It is currently part of the unified budget so that it makes the deficit appear smaller. But it really ought to be segregated in a trust fund. 
Similar concerns were expressed about the highway trust fund. Across Pennsylvania, and I think reflective of America, people want the moneys used for the gasoline tax to be used for the highway trust fund or mass transit. Across my State, I hear enormous concerns about Continental 1, a major highway, transcontinental highway, which will start in Toronto, Canada, and go all the way to Florida. It picks up a stretch of highway known as U.S. 219 in Pennsylvania where people are very anxious to have that on the books. And we would have the money, if we use the highway trust fund, for that purpose. 
We had amendments narrowly defeated in both the Senate and the House by 2 votes, I recollect, 216 to 214 in the House, and I know it was 51 to 49 here in the Senate where we attempted to allocate more funds for highways. I hear concerns all over my State about the need for more transportation funding. And the Mon Valley Expressway linking Fayette County, Uniontown to Pittsburgh would be a bonanza to develop that section of southwestern Pennsylvania which has been hit so hard by the losses of the steel industry, the coal industry, and the glass industry. 
And all over the State there is this interest in highways. I can personally attest, traveling around the back roads of my State, how tough it is to travel, to get behind a big truck. It happens all the time on a two-lane highway, and what had been planned as a 45-minute trip takes an hour and 10 minutes. The infrastructure is so very, very vital. We ought to be taking a much closer look there. 
There are similar concerns on airports, as I traveled through the State, where airports ought to be improved. Infrastructure would improve job opportunities. Major corporations, companies want to settle in communities which have access to air service. 
I also heard grave concern about what is going on with the managed care and with HMO's and with the issue of the so-called gag rule where family doctors are not permitted to have a referral to a specialist. We legislated on what was called the drive-by deliveries, requiring that women giving birth spend at least 48 hours in the hospital. Further, we have pending legislation on so-called drive-by mastectomies, where women who undergo that very difficult operative procedure are not ousted from the hospital. These complicated issues are obviously matters which are better left without congressional micromanagement, but something which we may have to get into, to some extent. But there is grave concern as managed care move across America, that there be fair access for the people who are insured and concern about HMO's paying their fair share on medical education and the so-called DSH proposals of disproportionate share for care for the indigent. 
These are some of the items which I heard a great deal about as I traveled through my State.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I see no other Senator on the floor seeking recognition, so I will amplify my remarks at this time about the concerns which I have on the congressional oversight and the need for additional congressional oversight on the incidents arising out of Ruby Ridge. 
Mr. President, the incident at Ruby Ridge has been very heavily publicized. And there have been a number of investigations on this subject. And investigations are continuing at the present time. 
This incident occurred back on August 21, 1992, which is more than 5 years ago. With the possible exception of the incident at Waco, this incident at Ruby Ridge has caused tremendous consternation with respect to action by the Federal Government. 
The essential events at Ruby Ridge were that a man named Randy Weaver had been arrested for selling two sawed-off shotguns and had not made his court appearances. A large contingent of Federal law enforcement officers went to his home at Ruby Ridge in Idaho to take Mr. Randy Weaver into custody. It is a very complex matter, a very lengthy matter. I will only summarize the essential factors. 
A firefight broke out on August 21, 1992. In the course of that firefight, a Federal marshall, deputy marshall, Mr. William Degan, was killed, 14-year-old Sammy Weaver, son of Mr. Randy Weaver and Mrs. Vicki Weaver, was killed, and Mrs. Vicki Weaver was killed. 
The large force which had assembled there to take Mr. Randy Weaver into custody did so because of reports by the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agency, which were false, that there had been prior convictions as to Mr. Randy Weaver--and he had not been convicted of anything--and that Mr. Weaver was a suspect in bank robbery cases, which is untrue. 
The essential findings, the essential overstatements, were summarized by FBI Director Louis Freeh, who testified at our Judiciary subcommittee hearings on October 19, 1995, as follows: `One misstatement of fact exaggerated to another one, into a huge pile of information that was just dead wrong.' As a result of those erroneous statements, this firefight occurred and these deaths occurred. 
There have been a number of investigations conducted. Most recently, a brief report was filed by the Department of Justice on Ruby Ridge, which is only a small part of the full report which was filed. This one is eight pages. It was issued back on August 15. In the course of this report, there is a notation of some six prior investigations on this matter. There had been an exhaustive report by the Department of Justice task force that was issued on June 10, 1994. There was an investigation conducted by the FBI Inspection Division. There was an investigation initiated by the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility, following a letter from special agent Eugene Glenn, who was the on-scene commander in Idaho. He was an FBI agent in charge in Idaho. Then the Judiciary subcommittee conducted its inquiry, and then there was an investigation conducted by U.S. attorney Michael Stiles, who is the U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Pennsylvania. He took over for the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. Mr. Eric Holder had recused himself because he knew some of the agents who were involved. 
I had expressed my own concern on a number of occasions about the length of time that the Department of Justice investigation was taking because there were a number of FBI officials who had been suspended, with pay, and were simply sitting dormant. Based upon the knowledge that I had of this incident, because of the hearings which we had through the Judiciary subcommittee, it seems to me that the matter should have been concluded a long time ago.

Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, we are currently on the legislation of the appropriation bill for the Department of Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education. I, again, repeat the earlier request that anyone who has an amendment to offer, come and do so at this time. There is plenty of time available right now. Earlier the majority leader had been on the floor, and Senator Harkin and I and Senator Lott, our majority leader, had discussed the timing. It was our hope that we might complete action on this bill by tomorrow evening. We request that anybody who has amendments to file do so by the close of business today or, in any event, not later than noon tomorrow. We have a vote scheduled for 9:30 tomorrow morning. It is the practice that Senators will be present at that time to vote, so we can move ahead if there are amendments to be considered on this bill.

Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, in the absence of any other Senator on the floor, I will utilize this time to comment on the subject of campaign finance reform. I stated earlier that in my travels through Pennsylvania during part of the month of August, I heard considerable concern about the necessity for campaign finance reform, and I had commented about the overtone throughout my open house town meetings about people of my State being very suspicious of Government, very distrustful of Government. One of those items was Ruby Ridge, and I spoke at some length about that. Another item was the subject of campaign finance reform, where I have found very considerable interest, disagreeing with some of the pundits and some of the public comments. 
It is my hope, Madam President, that the hearings before the Governmental Affairs Committee, on which you and I sit, will stimulate an interest in campaign finance reform. I have said with some frequency in the past that I do not believe we will have campaign finance reform until the American people demand it. It is contrary to the interests of incumbents to have campaign finance reform. This is a matter of considerable disagreement within this body, and I respect the views of our colleagues who have disagreed. But I do believe that we are awash in money. After 6 months of investigation and after 4 weeks of hearings by our Governmental Affairs Committee during the month of July, it confirms my conclusion and the view of most Americans that campaign finance reform is necessary. 
Politics is awash in money, corrupting some, appearing to corrupt others, and making almost everybody in or out of the system uneasy about the way political campaigns are financed. I compliment our colleagues, John McCain and Russ Feingold, for providing leadership on campaign finance reform in Senate bill 25. I believe that the key provision there, which would give candidates free television advertising time, does not measure up to the constitutional standard of the fifth amendment on taking property without due process of law. I recognize the contention that the airwaves belong to the American people. But in the context where television stations and networks have operated, I do not see how you can square, constitutionally, the taking of that property without compensation. 
I voted last year for cloture, to bring the issue to the floor so we can debate it, consider it, and it would be my hope that it would be brought to the floor in the month of September. I am aware of the public statements made by Senator McCain and others that it may be brought and attached to other bills. So we will wait to see if that does occur. 
My intention is to offer my own bill on campaign finance. I am in the final stages of the drafting of the bill and the floor statement. It would target some of the specific abuses and would expand upon what any other legislation has done in terms of what we have found from our Governmental Affairs investigation. 
My own sense is that the evidence is conclusive that soft money ought to be eliminated. When you take a look at the millions of dollars which have been poured into the American electoral system, including corporate contributions on soft money, it has just totally distorted the Presidential campaigns--and also congressional campaigns--as that money moves in and out in a variety of contours. But we have public financing of Presidential elections. That public financing has been undertaken on the basis that there will not be private financing. But somehow soft money is not deemed to be a contribution, so says the Department of Justice of the United States in an inexplicable interpretation--inexplicable, in my opinion. And then according to the reports of both Dick Morris and former chief of staff Leon Panetta, the President of the United States edited and wrote Democratic National Committee campaign commercials. That, obviously, is coordination. 
There is a constitutional rule that an independent expenditure, constitutionally may not be limited by a statute. But here you have the President taking money from the Democratic National Committee that was raised as soft. And, when I talk about the President, the same thing is done on the Republican side. So that I think there is bipartisan blame here. 
The specific evidence has been forwarded as to what President Clinton's personal involvement was. And there are these commercials. They extol the virtues of one candidate, and they criticize the other candidate. And for some reason they are not classified as being advocacy commercials but only issue commercials. 
I ask unanimous consent to include illustrations of these commercials on a letter that I wrote to Attorney General Reno dated May 1, 1997, her response, and also the response of the Federal Election Commission on this subject.

<TEXT>
Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, that subject came up in Judiciary Committee oversight with the Attorney General testifying the day before, on April 30, where the commercials extol one candidate, criticize another, and, yet, are not considered to be advocacy commercials. 
The first point of the legislation which I am preparing would end soft money. 
The second point would define express advocacy to enforce the intent of the Federal election laws to prevent coordinated campaigns and to say where a commercial praises a named candidate or criticizes a named candidate, that that does constitute express advocacy. 
The third provision on legislation that I am preparing would require affidavits on so-called independent expenditures. In Buckley versus Valeo, the Supreme Court of the United States said that as a matter of constitutional law Congress could not limit what an individual wanted to spend on the campaign--for example, Senator X or Presidential candidate Y--if they were truly independent. But the reality of many of these independent expenditures, if not most, is that they are not independent at all. 
After surveying the scene and thinking about it, my legislation would require an affidavit to be taken by the individual who is making the independent expenditure, or the head of the committee making independent expenditure, that the expenditure is truly independent. If someone sits down and reads an affidavit, takes an oath and understands that person is subject to the penalties of perjury, there may be a little more credibility or more attention paid to what is said. If you go to jail for 5 years, that may make someone pause on a representation that an expenditure is independent. 
Then my legislation would provide 48 hours after that affidavit is filed, the individual making the independent expenditure would have 24 hours to file the affidavit, and then within 48 hours file the affidavit with the Federal Election Commission. And then within 48 hours the Federal Election Commission would give that affidavit to the campaign on whose behalf the expenditure was made. And then the candidate and the campaign treasury would have to take an affidavit that the expenditure in question is truly independent. If people are prepared to take affidavits, both the person making the expenditure and the person committing on whose behalf the expenditure is made, we might see some independent expenditures which are truly independent. 
The fourth provision in the bill, which I intend to offer and hopefully becomes statute, would eliminate foreign transactions which funnel money into the U.S. campaigns. This would be along the line of--we heard the testimony as to what happened in the famous transaction where the former Republican National Chairman, Mr. Haley Barbour, testified. There, if you collapse the transaction, money did come from a foreign source into the Republican National Committee. I think that Mr. Barbour got bad advice as to what was going on there, and details of that evidence show that when advice of counsel was obtained that the transaction was lawful. It was on the condition that the money not go to a political committee. But, in fact, that is what happened. The attorney who received that letter, saying that the legitimacy of the transaction would depend upon the money not going to a political committee, testified at our Governmental Affairs Committee that he didn't notice that provision, even though a letter was to him, or read that provision. The letter was, in fact, going to someone else. So that, if we tighten up on that provision so that the transaction is viewed as a whole, those kinds of foreign contributions would be eliminated. 
A fifth provision of the legislation which I will propose would seek to deter massive spending of personal wealth which adopts a new standby financing framework similar to the one recently enacted in Maine, the State represented by our distinguished Presiding Officer at the moment. 
Buckley versus Valeo provides as a constitutional matter that an individual may spend as much of his or her money as he or she chooses. For many years, Senator Hollings and I have sought to have a constitutional amendment. That split decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, in my opinion, does not accurately state what is meant by `freedom of speech.' Freedom of speech does not give, in my judgment, the right of an individual to spend as much of his or her money as he or she may choose when the Supreme Court acknowledges at the same time that any other individual may be limited by what that individual may give to a Senator's campaign--$1,000 in the primary, or $1,000 in a general election. 
I personally was running against Senator Heinz for the U.S. Senate seat in 1976 on a campaign which started with a limitation as to how much money an individual could spend. For a State the size of Pennsylvania it was $35,000, which was close to my amassed wealth. I was prepared to spend it. In the middle of that campaign, on the end of January 1976, the Supreme Court of the United States said that an individual could spend as much of his or her money as he or she chose but that my brother, Morton Specter, who could have financed my campaign rather generously had he chosen to do so, and I think was prepared to do so, was limited to $1,000. Where were Morton Specter's constitutional rights for freedom of speech contrasted with the rights of a candidate? But that is the constitutional law. 
But Maine has a very interesting way of handling excessive spending by providing matching funds to candidates when an opponent exceeds certain spending limits. I personally oppose public financing of Federal elections. But I think in a situation where a wealthy individual knew that a multimillion-dollar expenditure would be matched by the State, it would be a deterrence, and, in fact, the State would not have to put up that money. I think that provision is well worth considering. 
The final provision of the statute which I have in mind would subject contributions for legal defense funds to be reported. And our Governmental Affairs Committee has heard incredible testimony about moneys brought in by Mr. Yah Lin `Charlie' Trie, something in the neighborhood of $639,000. He brought it in to the trustees of the President's legal campaign fund. Those moneys were not subject to any reporting requirements. And an article, which appeared in yesterday's Philadelphia Inquirer, points out how these suspect funds were known, and that reporting was delayed. 
I ask unanimous consent that the text of this article be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. 
That, in a fairly abbreviated statement, Madam President, is the substance of legislation which I propose to offer. 
It is my hope that the hearings of the Governmental Affairs Committee will bring substantial public interest to this subject. I know that the Presiding Officer has cosponsored the McCain legislation, is very much in favor of campaign finance reform, and perhaps, if our hearings generate enough public interest, that kind of public demand will be created. 
It is worth noting that at an early stage in the Watergate hearings people were disinterested in campaign finance reform at that time. But as those hearings progressed more public interest was stimulated, and campaign finance reform was enacted in 1974. But I believe that this is very, very important if we are to bring back public confidence with what is done in Washington, DC. 
Madam President, in the absence of anyone on the floor seeking recognition, I again suggest the absence of quorum.

Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, when the time comes to discuss the matter, there will be very vigorous objection from the managers, both Senator Harkin and myself, on this amendment. We think that low-income energy assistance is very, very important. But we will await the event after our distinguished colleague from Arizona has had a chance to make his presentation. 
In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on the historic legislation we are considering today, which will have profound effects throughout our Nation as we near the first balanced Federal budget since 1969. As a longtime supporter of the balanced budget constitutional amendment and the line-item veto, I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to reflect on the significance of this occasion. 
I think the 5-year glide path to a balanced budget is very important for America. I think the two big priorities for America today are education and health care. I like what is being done here and in the tax reconciliation bill we will be considering, but I remain a little worried about our seniors. We might have to make some modifications for their benefit in the future after we see how some of these changes are implemented. I will be keeping a close eye on this issue as I travel in Pennsylvania's 67 counties, where we have more than 2 million senior citizens. 
From the beginning, I have said that a balanced budget could only become reality with support from the center. There is now a feeling around Congress that the American people are sick of all the bickering and they have asked us for action on the issues that mean the most to them, chief among them balancing our Nation's budget. Since 1995, I have worked with the Chafee-Breaux centrist coalition to try to reconcile the differences between the two parties on the major entitlement and tax issues which we needed to address if we were going to achieve a balanced budget. I was proud of my association with this group of 22 Senators, which got 46 votes for its substitute budget resolution in 1996 and showed that there was bipartisan support for a centrist-oriented plan. 
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 represents what I have been saying for several years, that the budget can be balanced without leaving a bad taste in the minds of the public toward Republicans. It can be done without appearing insensitive toward the poor, elderly, children, and without appearing unconcerned with education, health care, and the environment. The budget agreement reflected in this legislation represents the traditional Republican objective of balancing spending and revenues and reflects my approach of moderation within fiscal conservatism, or what has been termed compassionate conservatism. 
I would not further that this legislation reflects my preference for cutting with a scalpel, not a meat ax. As chairman and ranking member of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, in the past 2 years Senator Harkin and I have succeeded in terminating 126 programs totaling $1.4 billion using this scalpel approach. The patience that has been demonstrated by our Budget Committee chairman, Senator Pete Domenici and the other key budget negotiators reflects their action to achieve the level of savings needed to bring the budget into balance. 
Throughout the budget process, I have sought to work with my colleagues to protect programs and funding which was particularly important to groups of Americans least able to fend for themselves. In particular, I am pleased to note that the Conference Report includes the $1.5 billion in Medicare premium subsidies which are essential for the estimated 3.2 million American seniors who earn in the area of $9,000 to $12,000 annually. I initiated an effort with several of my Republican colleagues to restore these funds when they were initially left out of this bill as reported out of the Finance Committee. After five of us wrote Majority Leader Trent Lott to urge that the funds be restored to the bill, the leadership accepted our request and added the $1.5 billion. Once the funds were restored, however, I still had some concerns about the allocation of these funds and whether the subsidies would continue as long as the premium 
increases. During Senate floor consideration of the bill, I was pleased to offer an amendment cosponsored by Senator Rockefeller, Santorum, Snowe, Collins, and Campbell to make the premium subsidies permanent as is the premium increase. Although a majority of Senators voted with us, the amendment only received 52 of the 60 votes needed to meet certain Budget Act procedural requirements and thus failed to be accepted. 
Among the reforms I supported in the Medicare Program is the expanded array of choices from which beneficiaries can obtain coverage. These new Medicare Plus plans will include traditional fee-for-service, provider sponsored organizations, medical savings accounts, private plan/health maintenance organizations, and preferred provider organizations. Beneficiaries will be given the freedom to choose the option which best meets their health care needs. I have also supported the addition of $4 billion in preventive health services to the Medicare benefit package, such as coverage of annual screening for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, bone density screening, and diabetes self-management services that would include nutrition therapy and blood testing strips. 
This legislation is designed to protect the solvency of Medicare for 10 more years. I view this program as part of our social contract with our senior and believe that we must keep our noses to the grindstone to develop a means of permanently protecting Medicare so that it remains available to provide adequate health care for future generations of American seniors. 
Another group of Americans I have sought to help in the budget process are children who do not have access to adequate health care. I am quite pleased that the $24 billion child health program included in this legislation has the potential to cover over 5 million children of the working poor who currently lack health insurance. My Healthy Children's Pilot Program Act of 1997 [S. 435] was the first Republican bill introduced in the 105th Congress which sought to bridge this glaring gap in the Nation's health care system. Although I believe that we could have provided such coverage through a discretionary spending program that relied on the States to implement creative new programs, I fully support the program established under the Balanced Budget Act, which will direct $24 billion over 5 years to States for the purpose of providing health care to children in low income families who earn too much for Medicaid, but too little to be able to purchase health insurance. One specific concern of mine as Congress crafted this legislation centered around ensuring that Pennsylvania's vanguard Caring and BlueCHIP children's health programs were protected rather than superseded by a new Federal bureaucracy. I am pleased to see that this bill specifically grandfathers Pennsylvania's programs, recognizing them as examples of success and innovation. 
During consideration of the Senate version of this legislation, there were several provisions I could not support and I am pleased that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 does not contain them. In particular, these were the provisions to extend the Medicare age of eligibility from 65 to 67, to impose new copayments on Medicare beneficiaries receiving home health services, and to means-test Medicare premiums. As the final compromise legislation demonstrates, it is possible to reach the goal of a balanced budget while also protecting access to quality health care, affordability, and choice in the Medicare program. This bill will also begin what I hope is a bipartisan process to address the long term implications of the baby boom generation for the Medicare program by establishing a Medicare Commission which will report to Congress with recommendations on how to ensure Medicare program solvency well into the 21st Century. 
Another issue which I have worked on is preserving funding for Pennsylvania under the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Program, which reimburses States for their payments 
to hospitals for medical treatment for low income Americans. Of particular importance to Pennsylvania were the proposed restrictions on the use of funds by States to reimburse Institutes of Mental Disease [IMD's]. While we were able to convince Chairman Roth to delay the restrictions by 1 year during Senate floor consideration of the bill, I continue to be troubled that this legislation unfairly penalizes Pennsylvania by limiting its ability to spend Federal resources on IMD's. I have worked with Gov. Tom Ridge and Senator Rick Santorum to seek modifications to these legislative provisions and would note that Pennsylvania faced losses of as much as $1.7 billion under an early draft of the Medicaid reform proposal and will instead face reductions in the area of $131 million. I am not satisfied with the proposed reforms in this program and, since the IMD restrictions do not go into effect until fiscal year 2000, I will work closely with Governor Ridge and Senator Santorum to see what we can do to ensure that Pennsylvania receives its fair share of Medicaid DSH funds in the outyears. 
In closing, I would note that as with any comprehensive reform legislation, it will take some time to determine what, if any, modifications will be needed to ensure that we protect seniors, children, and others who rely on the Federal and State programs that constitute our social safety net. However, on the whole, this is a good piece of legislation which moves us toward the goal of balancing the Federal budget by 2002.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to vote in favor of the Taxpayer Relief Act, which will provide the first significant tax cut to working Americans in 16 years. 
Although I still believe that we ought to move to a system of a fairer, flatter tax without myriad exemptions and deductions, this bill represents an important first step toward relieving the tax burden on working Americans and families. This tax bill provides a net tax reduction of $96 billion over 5 years while remaining on a glide path toward a balanced budget. 
Specifically, I am pleased that the final package includes a $500 per child tax credit, tax incentives for education, including education IRA's, a modified Hope Scholarship and tax free treatment of State prepaid tuition plans. It also takes important steps toward expanding participation in IRA's, a reduction in the capital gains tax and AMT, and incentives for small business by reinstatement of the home office business deduction and an acceleration in the phase in of the self-employed health insurance deduction. 
On estate taxes, an area where I have long believed that we must have relief, this bill would help family farmers and small businesses by increasing the exclusion to $1.3 million. It would also increase the exclusion for families to $1 million over 10 years. 
In conclusion, Mr. President when combined with the budget savings bill passed earlier today, we have made real progress on putting our financial house in order and providing necessary tax relief to millions of Americans.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I must echo the comments of my colleague from Pennsylvania with respect to the National Education Center for Women in Business, which provides invaluable services to women from all over this country to encourage the establishment and growth of businesses. The Center's programs are truly in the national interest and as a member of the Appropriations Committee I have been pleased to work with my colleague, Senator Santorum, and Congressman Mascara in support of the Center and its funding needs. The federal funds we have sought are necessary to bring the Center to a position of self-sufficiency where it can operate solely with private funds in the future.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to introduce the Victim Protection Act of 1997. 
I commend my colleague, Representative Joseph Pitts, for his leadership in preparing this legislation which he is introducing today in the House of Representatives. 
This legislation arises from the case of Commonwealth versus Lisa Michelle Lambert where the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania found a violation of the defendant's constitutional rights and issued an order barring the defendant from a retrial. 
The Congress has the authority to legislate under Article V of the 14th amendment which provides: 
The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. 
This legislation is designed to prevent the U.S. District Courts from ordering a remedy to bar a new trial. 
This legislation respects the authority of the Federal courts to uphold a defendant's constitutional rights in State court criminal proceedings. It may well be that the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit will act to reverse the order barring a retrial. 
Whatever action is taken in the case of Commonwealth versus Lisa Michelle Lambert, the Federal habeas corpus law should be clear that U.S. District Courts do not have the authority to bar a retrial. 
Under our Federal system, it should be--and this bill will establish the statutory authority--for the district attorney in Lancaster County to make the judgment whether the unsuppressed evidence is sufficient for a retrial. It would then be up to the court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County to make the first judicial judgment on the retrial issues with appropriate appellate procedures in the Superior and Supreme Courts of Pennsylvania. 
This principled approach respects judicial independence. 
When the District Court issued its opinion, there was an immediate public outcry for impeachment. At that time, I said and I repeat today, impeachment is not an appropriate response. 
The appropropriate response is an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which will review the matter. A further appropriate response is legislation to make the statute explicit that the district court may not impose a remedy to bar a new trial. 
This bill would not affect the otherwise extensive authority of the U.S. District Courts to protect rights where constitutional issues are raised. Obviously, a statute could not deal with the defendant's constitutional rights. That would require a constitutional amendment. 
However, this bill on the issue of retrial is within the purview of appropriate legislation pursuant to Article V of the 14th amendment.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation designed to address aviation safety concerns which arise out of the proliferation of aircraft repair facilities outside the United States which are used by airplanes that fly within our Nation every day. This legislation would change current regulations so that U.S. aircraft are repaired to the maximum extent possible by professional U.S. mechanics, properly trained and supervised, using certified parts. This bill also addresses the critical issue of substandard or uncertified airplane parts, known as bogus parts. 
I am pleased to be joined by 10 of my Republican and Democratic colleagues in introducing the Aircraft Repair Station Safety Act of 1997, which is similar to a bill introduced by my colleague from Pennsylvania, Congressman Borski (H.R. 145) which currently has 135 cosponsors. 
A key focus for many of us in the 105th Congress is aviation safety. As a member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I have worked with my colleagues to ensure that we spend the maximum amount possible on improving our aviation infrastructure for safety purposes, including altogether new runways, runway extension projects, and new generations of radar and landing systems. Air travel is an essential element of our lives, as millions of Americans use airplanes for personal and business trips. Our economy is deeply rooted in the success of our aviation system, which makes it even more critical that we take all necessary steps to enhance aviation safety. 
This legislation is intended to address a regulatory loophole created in November, 1988, when the Federal Aviation Administration promulgated new rules which weakened the restrictions on certification for foreign aircraft repair stations. The 1988 changes have resulted in a situation where FAA certification--the highest seal of approval in the world--is much too easy to obtain. Prior to those changes, a foreign repair facility had to demonstrate that there was a need to service aircraft engaged in international travel before they could get certified. But now, a station can receive FAA certification for the simple goal of attracting U.S. business. I am advised that repair stations in Tijuana, Mexico and Costa Rica applied for and received FAA certification even though few expect these locations to become new hubs for international travel. Instead, these facilities are becoming new hubs for stealing U.S. jobs and could potentially jeopardize aviation safety because of inadequacies in U.S. regulatory oversight. 
One example of where work performed on an aircraft at a foreign facility had significant repercussions within the United States was the 1994 engine explosion and fire on a Valujet plane on the runway at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, which necessitated the evacuation of the 57 passengers. According to media reports, the work was done at a Turkish repair station that lacked FAA approval, and whose shabby business practices included plating over a cracked and corroded compressor disk. Had the explosion occurred in midflight, the results could have been catastrophic. 
When the 1988 regulations were adopted, the FAA expected that the number of foreign repair stations it certified would rise from the level of 200 to possibly 300 or 400. I understand that there are now nearly 500 such foreign aircraft repair stations with FAA certification. This comes at a time, however, when the FAA is having enough trouble inspecting domestic repair stations and enforcing aviation safety rules within facilities in the 50 States. I find it hard to believe that the FAA has sufficient resources to adequately investigate problems at the 480 foreign aircraft repair facilities in addition to its U.S. responsibilities. 
I am advised that one recent phenomenon is that foreign repair facilities are being used by some U.S. carriers on a contract basis as a means of holding down costs, and some have become what have been termed virtual airlines because so little maintenance and repair work is done in-house. Instead of aircraft repair work being done at relatively few sites, countless contractors and subcontractors domestically and abroad are now filling that function. 
I would note that the Gore Commission on Aviation Safety and Security stated in its Final Report of February 12, 1997 that: 
Considerable attention has been given to the issue of outsourcing of maintenance and other work, particularly in the wake of the Valujet crash. The Commission does not believe that outsourcing, in and of itself, presents a problem--if it is performed by qualified companies and individuals. The proper focus of concern should be on the FAA's certification and oversight of any and all companies performing aviation safety functions, including repair stations certificated by the FAA but located outside of the United States. (Emphasis added.) 
A problem is that under the current regulatory framework, foreign aircraft repair stations have not had to demonstrate legitimate need or to meet all the standards and procedures imposed on U.S. stations. For example, I am advised that domestic facilities and their employees must meet rigorous worker surveillance standards including broad drug and alcohol testing requirements. Many other nations seeking to compete do not have these same requirements in place or the same level of enforcement. There is also a discrepancy between the requirement that certain mechanics at a U.S. facility are certified airmen and the absence of such a mandate on certified foreign repair stations. One would think that this requirement is important enough to be imposed wherever a plane which flies within our borders is repaired and maintained. Accordingly, this legislation provides that all standards imposed on domestic repair stations and their employees must be imposed on foreign facilities and their employees. 
In sponsoring this legislation, I am not attempting to deprive U.S. carriers of access to foreign repair facilities when necessary. Strategically based foreign repair stations have been part of our aviation network since 1949, when it was recognized that such stations were needed for the repair of U.S. aircraft operating outside our airspace. In addition, foreign manufacturers producing FAA-approved air frames or components have traditionally been allowed to support their products. Further, it is my intention that this legislation would not hinder the repair of U.S. aircraft abroad which do not operate within the United States. 
This legislation would not change these accepted practices, but would give the FAA the opportunity to revisit this issue by returning the regulations governing the certification of repair stations to what they were before November, 1988. This legislation is aimed at the proliferation of foreign FAA-certified repair facilities which exist to service aircraft that, except for the cheap labor and lower regulatory oversight, would never leave the United States. 
This legislation would also clamp down on the possibility that aircraft repair stations would knowingly use bogus parts instead of properly certified parts. The bogus airplane parts trade has become lucrative and gives real cause for concern. The FAA and law enforcement agencies have cracked down in recent years, resulting in 130 indictments across the country as of May, 1997 of people suspected of being dealers of bogus airplane parts. In one troubling media account, when an American Airlines plane crashed in Colombia in 1995, salvagers extracted valuable components from the plane before even all the bodies were collected and the parts were offered for sale in Miami shortly thereafter. Under this bill, if a facility is found to have knowingly used bogus parts, the FAA will revoke its certification. 
In closing, I want to reiterate that the Aircraft Repair Station Safety Act of 1997 is a sensible approach to increased aviation safety. This is more than just a jobs issue; peoples lives and our economy are at stake. At a time when the FAA's resources are stretched thin, I do not believe it is in the public interest to continue to certify foreign aircraft repair facilities which we cannot observe or regulate adequately. 
I look forward to working with the members of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee on this issue, as well as the carriers, both passenger and cargo, which operate under current regulations and whom I hope will support this legislation.

The project will develop a new crash test dummy particularly suited for research on automobile occupant safety because it will generate data on children's unique biological features and the behavior of children under crash conditions. 
I am advised that the House has provided $100,000 for this purpose within the budget for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Would the distinguished chairman be willing to work with me and our House counterparts to explore funding for this important safety initiative?

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is with a particular sense of privilege that I introduce legislation today to confer the status of honorary veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces to Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope. If any person in this country merits such an unprecedented honor--and Mr. President, it is my understanding that no person has ever before been conferred the status of honorary veteran--surely, it is Bob Hope. 
Bob Hope's contributions to this Nation--and, particularly, to its soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen--are well known to all of our citizens. Less well known to many is the fact that Bob Hope is a naturalized U.S. citizen, having emigrated to this country from England when Bob was just a boy. I am the son of a naturalized American--an immigrant who walked across Europe with barely a ruble in his pocket so that he could make his way to this country. So I know first hand that a person of humble origins can scale the heights of this country. Few, though, have scaled the heights that Bob Hope has scaled. 
When I say Bob Hope has scaled the heights, I am not referring to his success as an actor, a comedian, or businessman--though his success in all three areas has been considerable. When I say Bob Hope has scaled the heights, I am thinking of his place in the hearts of his adopted countrymen. 
Who in this country is more beloved by a broader spectrum of his fellow citizens than Bob Hope--people of all ages, races, religions, and beliefs? Perhaps, none more than Bob Hope. For the past 50 years, this country's fighting men and women could count on Bob Hope to lift their spirits and morale when they faced the prospect of making the ultimate sacrifice. In World War II, in Korea, in Vietnam and, most recently, in the Persian Gulf, Bob Hope and his troupe were there to entertain the troops. More importantly, they were there to remind our fighting men and women that they were not forgotten, that their suffering was appreciated. Bob Hope was always with the troops--especially during the holidays--enduring hardship, and often significant physical danger, so that he might encourage those facing greater hardship and danger. Three generations of veterans will never forget how much he cared. 
Those three generations of veterans wonder how they might properly recognize Bob Hope. He is already a recipient of the Nation's highest civilian decorations, the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. President Carter hosted a White House reception in honor of his 75th birthday. President Clinton bestowed upon him the Medal of the Arts. He has received more than 50 honorary doctorates, and innumerable awards from civic, social, and veterans organizations. But Bob Hope cannot say that he is a veteran--in my mind, one of the most honorable appellations one can carry. This legislation will remedy that. 
I ask that all of my colleagues join me in supporting legislation to designate Bob Hope an honorary veteran. And I thank the former Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps and the current president of the USO, Gen. Carl Mundy, for spearheading this effort.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment briefly on the issue of independent counsel. Yesterday, I spoke about my view that independent counsel ought to be appointed and the fact that there appeared to be no chance of Attorney General Reno appointing an independent counsel, and then exploring the alternatives of litigation and the alternative of an amendment to the independent counsel statute. I stated at that time that I intended to pursue legislation to modify the independent counsel statute and had hoped to put it on the appropriations bill on Commerce, State, Justice, and the Judiciary, but would not do so if it would tie up the bill. 
After consultation with the distinguished majority leader and others, it was apparent to me that such an amendment would tie up the bill and most probably provoke a filibuster on the other side, and that, in fact, a unanimous-consent agreement had been proposed which was conditional on tabling any amendment which I might offer. 
In addition to the amendment on independent counsel, I was considering, along with my distinguished colleague, Senator Hatch, offering a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling for the Attorney General to appoint independent counsel. But even a sense-of-the-Senate resolution would have provoked a likely filibuster to tie up the bill. So I did not proceed to do that, but instead filed at the desk yesterday legislation for independent counsel, after consultation with the majority leader, who said that if an opportunity presented itself that that matter might be called up as early as next week. That would not be certain because there are considerations as to what will happen with the reconciliation bill and the tax bill. 
In the alternative, after discussions with Senator Hatch, the alternative has been considered to have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution perhaps acted on next week, if there is time. It is the last week before the recess. But that is problematical.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in my judgment, there is an urgent need that independent counsel be appointed to investigate and prosecute campaign finance violations arising out of the 1996 Federal elections. The efforts to persuade Attorney General Reno to make that application for independent counsel have thus far failed. It is my view that it is important to consider alternatives in order to have independent counsel appointed. 
In my judgment, there are two possible alternatives available. One would be a lawsuit to ask the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the appropriate panel on independent counsel, to appoint independent counsel, notwithstanding the refusal of the Attorney General to make that application. 
The general rule of law is that a public official may not be compelled to perform a discretionary function, an area of law which I had some experience with as district attorney of Philadelphia. However, there is a narrow ambit, even when considering a 
discretionary rule, where there may be an application for relief if there is an abuse of discretion by the public official. It is my legal judgment that there has been such an abuse of discretion by the Attorney General in this situation. 
Another alternative would be to legislate in the field, to make it abundantly plain that independent counsel should be appointed here, and that the circuit court would have the authority to do so. In my opinion, there is a realistic likelihood of success on litigation at the present time. 
Although the independent counsel statute poses certain problems which make it to some extent uncertain, I believe there is a legal basis for proceeding to have the court appoint independent counsel without any modification of pending law. There is the alternative of legislating on this bill which is before the Senate, to make certain modifications of the independent counsel law, which would remove any conceivable doubt about the authority of the circuit court to appoint independent counsel. 
Mr. President, on the issue of the exhausting of remedies on requesting that independent counsel be appointed by Attorney General Reno, the record is replete with a whole series of requests having been made by individual Members of Congress and then by the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate. The issue was focused on very sharply with Attorney General Reno in oversight hearings which we had several months ago. I had an opportunity to question the Attorney General on this subject and pointed to two specific instances which, in my judgment, cried out for the appointment of independent counsel. 
President Clinton has publicly complained about having been denied national security information which he thought he should have and has complained that such information was denied to him by the FBI and the Department of Justice. In questioning Attorney General Reno on this subject in the Judiciary oversight hearing, she defended that denial of information on the ground that there was a pending criminal investigation and that as a matter of balance, it was her judgment as Attorney General that the information should not be turned over to the President. 
On the record in that Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, I disagreed with her conclusion on the ground that the Attorney General did not have the authority to decide what the President should or should not see on national security matters; the President as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive Officer of the United States has an absolute right to that information. If there were to be a denial to the President, it was not the function of the Attorney General or the FBI to deny that information. However, if the Attorney General felt that a denial of information was warranted under the circumstances, that was a very powerful showing that independent counsel ought to be appointed. If the President of the United States is in any way suspected, that provides a very strong basis that his appointed Attorney General ought not be conducting that investigation. It ought to be handled by independent counsel. 
It was pointed out to Attorney General Reno in the course of that oversight hearing that this followed directly her testimony on confirmation where she strongly endorsed the concept of independent counsel both as a matter of avoiding conflict of interest and, as Attorney General Reno said at that time, avoiding the appearance of conflict of interest. 
Notwithstanding that, she has refused to make an application for the appointment of independent counsel. 
A second line of questioning which I pursued with the Attorney General involved the issue of violations of the campaign finance laws. On that subject, there has been substantial information in the public domain about the President's personal activities in preparing television commercials for the 1996 campaign. There is no doubt--and the Attorney General conceded this--there would be a violation of the Federal election law if, when the President prepared campaign commercials, they were advocacy commercials, contrasted with what is known as issue commercials. The activity of the President in undertaking that activity has been documented in a book by Dick Morris and also in public statements by his chief of staff, Leon Panetta.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the essence of the Attorney General's response to me was that she would not respond on the legal issue, notwithstanding she is the Nation's chief law enforcement officer. She passed the buck over to the Federal Election Commission. The Federal Election Commission passed the buck back, saying that these were matters that had already occurred, so they didn't come within advisory opinions. One way or another, Mr. President, we will have a determination as to what is involved there. The alternative of proceeding in court is one which we are currently examining, and as I have noted, there is an issue as to whether that can be done on the existing statute. 
I do believe there is a legal basis for so proceeding, but on a novel bit of litigation of this sort, no lawyer can be absolutely certain as to what the result would be. But in the context of what we have on the record with the Attorney General's refusal to appoint independent counsel, in a context where she is denying the President of the United States national security information, and her refusal to proceed to appoint independent counsel where the Attorney General concedes that there has been a coordinated effort by the President so that the only remaining issue is whether there is an advocacy commercial, which on their face, I submit, these commercials are. The problems have been compounded with the conduct of the Attorney General and the Justice Department in the course of the last several days where they have opposed applications for immunity requested for consideration by the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
The Governmental Affairs Committee, as is well known, is currently investigating illegal or improper activities in the 1996 Federal elections. A modus operandi has been worked out there which would allow the Attorney General to come in and give the committee the Attorney General's opinion as to whether immunity should be withheld or granted. 
The law is plain that the committee has the jurisdiction to make that determination, where the statute gives the Attorney General a period of time to object and additional time for the purpose of putting the Department of Justice's case together. Due to the problems created by the decisions involving Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North go to a point where limited immunity is granted, the prosecutor must prove the case from independent sources and the prosecutor can put a case together, can, so to speak, bundle the case before immunity is granted. 
So when the request was made for applications for immunity for five individuals, the Attorney General responded, the Department of Justice responded that they objected to the grant of immunity. That was, so to speak, the straw which broke the camel's back and the chairman of the committee, Senator Thompson, made a very forceful public statement on Tuesday saying that he had lost confidence in the Department of Justice to conduct an impartial and appropriate investigation, and that the refusal to agree to those grants of immunity was just beyond the pale, a conclusion with which I agree. 
On the basis of the equities here, I believe a very, very strong case can be made out to have the Court, in its supervisory authority, appoint independent counsel notwithstanding the absence of an application by the Attorney General. However, in consultation with my colleagues, I have decided to introduce an amendment to the pending bill which would make certain modifications in the independent counsel statute. These modifications would create new authority for the Congress to seek judicial appointment of an independent counsel where there is a determination that the Attorney General's failure to do so is an abuse of discretion. This authority would reside in the Judiciary Committee, where the full committee or a majority of the majority party members or a majority of the nonmajority party members could petition the Court to appoint an independent counsel where the full committee or a majority of either party's committee members determines that the Attorney General's failure to appoint an independent counsel is an abuse of discretion. This carefully crafts a procedure so that there is a limit of standing as to who may come in and ask for the appointment of independent counsel. 
The amendment, which I propose to introduce, would further provide for a judicial determination on independent counsel with a specification that upon receipt of a congressional application, the Court shall appoint independent counsel where the Court has determined that the Attorney General's failure to appoint an independent counsel is an abuse of discretion. 
There are considerations on constitutional issues here, but I believe that other relevant issues must also be considered. 
Regarding the context of the current factual situation and carefully limiting the petitioning authority to the Congress, and in the context where the Attorney General herself has emphasized the importance of the independent counsel provision, including the avoidance of appearance of impropriety, it is my judgment that this law would pass constitutional muster and would provide an important addition in the interest of justice to solve the problem which we now confront, where the overwhelming weight of evidence--and I don't use that term lightly. It is evidence. It has evidentiary value--calls for the appointment of independent counsel. 
There is pending at the present time an amendment so I cannot introduce my amendment now. A subsequent amendment is pending. But it is my intention, as I say, Mr. President, to introduce this amendment. There have been some preliminary indications that the introduction of this amendment might tie up the bill, and I do not intend to tie up the bill. If that is the consequence of the introduction of an amendment, if a filibuster were to follow, I would not persist and subject this appropriations bill to a filibuster. I firmly believe that it is in the public interest in a very serious way to have independent counsel appointed, and it is obvious that all the entreaties to the Attorney General have thus far been unsuccessful and litigation is an option which may be pursued. However, this statutory change would make it certain that the Court would have the authority and that the petitioning parties would have appropriate standing to have independent counsel appointed. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment provides that none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Palestinian Authority shall be paid over to the Palestinian Authority unless the President certifies to the Congress, first, that the Palestinian Authority is using its maximum efforts to combat terrorism in accordance with the Oslo accords, has ceased the violence or threat of violence or incitement of violence as a tool of the Palestinian Authority. 
Second, after full investigation by the Department of Justice, the executive branch of Government concludes that Chairman Arafat had no prior knowledge of the World Trade Center bombing. 
Third, after a full inquiry to the Department of State, the executive branch of Government concludes that Chairman Arafat did not authorize and did not fail to use his authority to prevent the Tel Aviv cafe bombing of March 21, 1997. 
Mr. President, this amendment would not impact upon the expenditures of U.S. funds for projects like water authorities or other projects which go to the people who are now directed to receive these funds, but to articulate with precision, would only involve the moneys which would be paid to the Palestinian Authority. 
It may well be that there is no intent to pay money now in the pipeline for the Palestinian Authority, but I must say, Mr. President, that after making substantial efforts to find out exactly what is going on in the administration, I have been unable to make that determination. But whether or not there is an intent by the administration not to pay money in the pipeline to the Palestinian Authority, it is my view that this amendment is necessary as a matter of policy. 
With respect to the issue of Chairman Arafat's knowledge of the Trade Center bombing, a report has been made by Deputy Education Minister Moshe Peled of Israel that Arafat had prior knowledge of the bombing of the Trade Center in New York City in 1993. 
I have asked the Department of Justice, Mr. President, to conduct an investigation to determine whether or not that is true.

Mr. SPECTER. The essence of the matter is that this issue has been raised by a responsible Israeli official, and if Arafat in fact had prior knowledge of the bombing of the Trade Center, he may well be an accessory before the fact, or a coconspirator, and if that is so, he would be extraditable to the United States under provisions of our terrorist legislation passed in 1984 and 1986. 
It is simply unsatisfactory and intolerable to have that issue outstanding and be providing funding for the Palestinian Authority. 
The issue has also been raised on the bombing of the Tel Aviv cafe on March 21, 1997, as to whether Chairman Arafat and the PLO made a maximum effort to stop that kind of terrorism. Immediately after the bombing, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said that Arafat gave a green light to that bombing. When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appeared before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee in our hearing this spring, she responded that Arafat had not given a green light, but neither had he given a red light. Under the provisions of the amendment introduced by Senator Shelby and myself, Arafat has an absolute obligation, along with the PLO, to make the maximum effort to fight terrorism.

Mr. SPECTER. It is unsatisfactory, Mr. President, if Arafat did anything but put down a red light to stop the bombing of the Tel Aviv cafe which killed three Israelis and wounded dozens more, estimated to be approximately 40 other Israelis. There ought to be absolutely no doubt that if any funding is to come from the U.S. taxpayers to the Palestinian Authority, there be a certification by the President, based on evidence that Yasser Arafat was not a party to, did not know about, was not an accessory before the fact, or a coconspirator on the bombing of the Trade Center in 1993 and he, in fact, made the maximum effort which would require a red light on the bombing of the Tel Aviv restaurant. 
It is my understanding, Mr. President, this amendment is acceptable to both managers of the bill. 
Exhibit 1 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 
Office of Legislative Affairs, Washington, DC, April 29, 1997. 
Hon. Arlen Specter, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator Specter: This is in response to your letter to the Attorney General dated April 1, 1997. Your letter encloses a news article from The Jerusalem Post in which it is reported that Yasser Arafat may have had prior knowledge of the bombing of the World Trade Center building on February 26, 1993. 
Aside from the news report enclosed with your letter, the Department of Justice is unaware of any information that Yasser Arafat either had prior knowledge of the bombing of the World Trade Center or was in any way involved in the conspiracy to bomb the building. We have queried the Israeli authorities about this information and they deny the accuracy of the statements attributed in the article to the Deputy Education Minister. 
I hope this information is helpful. If we can be of further assistance with regard to this or any other matter, please do not hesitate to contact this office. 
Sincerely, 
Andrew Fois, Assistant Attorney General.   
U.S. Senate, 
Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC, May 14, 1997. 
Hon. Janet Reno, Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.  
Dear Attorney General Reno: By letter dated April 1, 1997, (copy enclosed) I wrote to you concerning Israeli Deputy Education Minister Moshe Peled's statement that Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat had prior knowledge of the 1993 plot to bomb New York City's World Trade Center. 
By letter dated April 29 (copy enclosed) Assistant Attorney General Andrew Fois responded with a very generalized statement about having `queried the Israeli authorities.' No mention was made whether the Department of Justice talked to Deputy Education Minister Moshe Peled or did any real pursuit on the matter. 
Since I do not speak Hebrew, my assistant, David Brog, Esquire, talked to Mr. Peled. Mr. Peled said that he was not prepared to disclose any more information on Chairman Arafat's connection in the World Trade Center bombing beyond what he told the Jerusalem Post. Mr. Brog said that Mr. Peled was not flexible on this point and that he (Mr. Brog) had the impression that Mr. Peled had gotten into some trouble for his previous disclosure. 
I am interested to know whether the Department of Justice talked to Mr. Peled before Mr. Fois's letter to me of April 29. If so, what he said. If not, why wasn't Mr. Peled questioned. 
I considered this an extremely serious matter. As you know, Chairman Arafat could be extradited to the United States if there is evidence to support Mr. Peled's charge. 
I formally request the Department of Justice to conduct a real investigation on this matter. 
Sincerely, Arlen Specter.  
 U.S. SENATE, 
Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC, April 1, 1997. 
Hon. Janet Reno, Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC. 
Dear Attorney General Reno: Just yesterday I saw a news report that Israeli intelligence has evidence that Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat had prior knowledge of the 1993 plot to bomb New York City's World Trade Center which killed six people. 
That news report quoted Deputy Education Minister Moshe Peled stating: 
`More than that, he [referring to Arafat] was part of the discussions on the operation.' The news report further said that Arafat was privy to the conspiracy and met with Sudanese and Islamic terrorist leaders. 
With this letter, I am enclosing for you a photostatic copy of the news report from the Jerusalem Post on March 26. 
I would very much appreciate it if you would conduct the appropriate investigation to determine what evidence exists, if any, of Arafat's complicity in this matter. 
It appears to me that, if true, Arafat would be prosecutable under U.S. criminal laws. I would appreciate your advice as to what indictments could be brought as to Chairman Arafat. 
Thank you for your consideration of this request. 
Sincerely, Arlen Specter.  
Exhibit 2 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC, March 25, 1997. 
Hon. Madeleine Albright, Secretary of State, Washington, DC. 
Dear Secretary Albright: According to the weekend press reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Palestinian Chairman Yassir Arafat has indirectly given a green light to the terrorists resulting in the suicide bomb which killed and wounded many Israelis last Friday. 
According to the news reports, Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian authority released Ibrahim Maqadmeh. Prime Minister Netanyahu further stated that Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian authority have failed to detain known terrorists and to confiscate weaponry. 
In my judgment, it is very important for the State Department to make a factual determination as to whether Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian authority did give a green light indirectly to the terrorists and whether there was a failure to detain known terrorists and to confiscate weaponry. 
I would appreciate your advice, as promptly as possible, on your Department's conclusion as to whether Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian authority gave an indirect green light to the terrorists. 
As you know, an amendment offered by Senator Shelby and myself to the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1995 conditions the $500 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinian authority on presidential certification that the Palestinian authority is complying with all of its commitments under its peace accords with Israel, including its commitment to prevent acts of terrorism and undertake `legal measures against terrorists, including the arrest and prosecution of individuals suspected of perpetrating acts of violence and terror.' 
The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, on which I sit, will soon be considering this issue for fiscal year 1998 so I would appreciate your prompt response. 
In addition, I would appreciate your advising me as to whether there is any U.S. aid in the pipeline which has not yet been turned over to the Palestinian authority. If so, I request that such payments be withheld until the determination as to whether the Palestinian authority is complying with the Specter-Shelby amendment. 
Sincerely, Arlen Specter.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have today introduced, at the request of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, S. 1017, a proposed bill to establish a presumption of total disability for certain individuals for purposes of nonservice-connected disability pension. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs submitted this legislation to the President of the Senate by letter dated June 16, 1997. 
My introduction of this measure is in keeping with the policy which I have adopted of generally introducing--so that there will be specific bills to which my colleagues and others may direct their attention and comments--all administration-proposed draft legislation referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Thus, I reserve the right to support or oppose the provisions of, as well as any amendment to, this legislation.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished Senator from Alaska in a brief colloquy, not just in his capacity as floor manager of the fiscal year 1998 Defense appropriations bill, but also as a leading proponent of the legislation that created employee stock ownership plans [ESOP's]. 
Mr. President, the Defense Contract Audit Agency [DCAA] is threatening the viability of ESOP defense contractors by applying different determinations of ESOP costs than the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor. It is my understanding that Congress intended that ESOP cost issues be governed by the tax and pension laws and regulations administered by those offices, not DCAA. If this matter is not resolved when the defense appropriations conference committee meets, would the distinguished chairman be willing to try to assist in resolving it at that point?

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for the purpose of engaging my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and the distinguished ranking minority member, in a colloquy regarding support for evolving telemedicine technologies, research and development on an advanced double hull ship design and research and development of the helicopter vectored trust ducted propeller. 
Mr. President, we all recognize the need to continue efforts to develop telemedicine services for our Armed Forces. I note in particular, efforts by institutions in the Northeast to design a telemedicine trauma/emergency medical services system to provide necessary diagnostic and treatment interventions and improve medical outcomes. 
Advanced research and development for the Navy is vital to ensure force readiness and capability for our Navy well into the future. The Navy is currently facing a technical challenge in design and manufacture of very large and complex structural systems that have historically been made of traditional steel materials but are now incorporating the use of more advanced materials like non-magnetic steels. Currently, there is no comprehensive initiative in the Navy to develop the most promising application of these new materials--a nonmagnetic, stainless steel advanced double hull warship design. The marriage of the advanced double hull concept with nonmagnetic steels offers the potential to reduce acquisition costs and improve survivability. I support a development program for the stainless steel advanced double hull concept that combines numerical analysis techniques with large-scale representative testing. 
Mr. President, in another area of military research and development, I point out the survivability and cost-effectiveness benefits from use of vectored ducted propeller helicopter technology. Research and development of this design will ensure that our Armed Forces are prepared for the next century. I look forward to working with my two colleagues during conference to address these programs.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues from West Virginia and Illinois in offering an amendment which would authorize continued funding for the successful program of medical research conducted jointly by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. 
This important and cost-effective program began in 1987 and has been funded at approximately $20 million per year every year since then. 
This research partnership is built on the concept of joint DOD-VA policy making, scientific review, and research performance. Research efforts are targeted at areas of mutual DOD-VA concern such as mutations in microorganisms that become known pathogens and are encountered by soldiers in foreign environments, trauma and wound healing, and stress-related chronic illnesses including PTSD and the possible effect of stress on undiagnosed symptoms experienced by Persian Gulf War veterans. 
The Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs are joined by their common responsibilities to the men and women who are first service members, but subsequently become veterans. In the DOD-VA Cooperative Research program each Department brings unique strengths to the table to advance their joint missions and commitments. Perhaps that is why DOD's Dr. Anna Johnson-Winegar, Director, Environmental and Life Sciences, has been quoted as saying `Our investigators are very enthusiastic about participating in these joint initiatives.' 
Mr. President, both the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs will benefit from the approval of this amendment. Even more importantly, the men and women who now wear the uniforms of our Armed Forces and who will one day become veterans will reap the benefits of the medical research authorized by this amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation which would require the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] to provide mammograms to women veterans in accordance with nationally accepted standards. 
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women and the No. 1 killer of women ages 40 to 49. I am, and will continue to be, personally committed to ensuring that the women of this country receive mammography screening in accordance with the highest possible standards. Enactment of this legislation will ensure that our Nation's women veterans receiving care at Veterans Health Administration [VHA] treatment facilities will have access to mammography screening in accordance with accepted national policy. 
At issue is the question of how often women should receive screening mammography examinations and the age at which those examinations should begin. On March 23, 1997, the American Cancer Society [ACS] recommended that women begin annual mammography screening at age 40. On March 27, 1997, after much deliberation, the National Cancer Advisory Board recommended that all women between 40 and 49 years receive regular mammogram screening every 1 to 2 years. The National Cancer Institute accepted the same recommendation, both recommendations being very close to the new ACS standard of annual screening beginning at age 40. In addition, the American College of Radiology Board of Chancellors approved revised guidelines in January 1997, affirming its support for yearly screening for women after the age of 40. 
The issue of mammography screening for women between the ages of 40 to 49 has been an issue of particular interest to me and one that has occupied quite a bit of my time during the first half of 1997. In my capacity as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, I have already held four hearings this year addressing the importance of mammography screening for women ages 40 to 49; one here in Washington, DC on February 5, in Philadelphia, PA on February 20, in Pittsburgh, PA on February 24, and in Hershey, PA on March 3, 1997. I have heard testimony, from physicians and women alike, advocating mammography screening beginning at age 40. Currently, 40 States have enacted legislation, and 4 States have legislation pending, which would require either insurance reimbursement for, or mandatory provision of, routine mammogram screening of women ages 40 to 49. Obviously, our Nation sees the value of screening women early for breast cancer, and the impact that early detection can have on decreasing the mortality of this No. 1 killer of women between 40 and 49. 
It is estimated that last year 184,300 women were diagnosed with breast cancer, and this year nearly 44,000 women will die from the disease. Research indicates that regular mammograms for women in their 40's can cut breast cancer mortality by 17 percent. When Dr. Vogel of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and Magee Women's Hospital testified at the February 24 hearing in Pittsburgh, PA, he stated that there are nearly 1 million women in Pennsylvania between the ages of 40 and 49, and that nearly 2,000 will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year. As many as 1,000 of these women will die. He stated that if women aged 40 to 49 were screened annually, this death toll could be reduced by 250. 
I am disappointed that VHA has refused to adopt this higher, now national, standard of mammography screening for our Nation's women veterans despite these research findings and national recognition that early mammography screening can save thousands of women's lives each year. In a report issued in April, 1997, VA's Inspector General Office of Health Care Inspections [OHI] offered their objective and critical assessment of the status of mammography services being provided to our Nation's women veterans receiving treatment at VA treatment facilities. Some of OHI's findings are particularly alarming. For example, only 36 percent of women veterans treated in 1995 were even offered a mammogram and only 79 percent of the VHA facilities systematically recorded reviews of outcome data, including disposition of positive mammograms and correlation of surgical biopsy results with radiologic interpretations. Only 72 percent of VHA facilities assessed effectiveness using quality improvement or quality assurance monitors, and none of the VHA facilities assessed customer satisfaction, quality of final diagnostic product, or any other quality of care indicators for contracted providers of mammography services. 
The OHI recommended that VHA offer mammograms in accordance with ACS guidelines--yearly mammography screening, beginning at age 40. VHA, maintaining that mammography screening for women between the ages of 50 to 69 is sufficient, rejected this recommendation. For this reason, I am compelled to introduce this legislation which will require the Department of Veterans Affairs to, at a minimum, offer mammograms in accordance with the most prudent guidelines, those of the American Cancer Society, which call for yearly mammogram screening starting at age 40. 
The women who receive treatment at any of our Nation's VA medical centers deserve mammography screening consistent with the accepted national standard--the highest standard, which is currently the recommendation of the American Cancer Society. As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting this legislation.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss an amendment which has been circulated with both the majority and minority, which refers to establishing procedures for a report not later than 90 days after the enactment of the defense authorization bill, for the Secretary of Defense to submit to the congressional defense committees a report containing the following: No. 1, an assessment of the current policies and practices of the Department of Defense with respect to the protection of members of the Armed Forces against terrorist attack abroad, including any modifications of such policies or practices that are proposed or implemented as a result of the assessment; and, second, an assessment of the procedures of the military departments intended to determine accountability, if any, in the command structure in instances in which a terrorist attack results in the loss of life at an installation or facility of the Armed Forces abroad. 
This report is being sought because of what happened on June 25, 1996, when a bomb detonated not more than 80 feet from the Air Force housing complex known as Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 members of the Air Force and injuring hundreds more, as many as 400 more. 
This incident came under very intensive scrutiny by the Intelligence Committee, which I chaired last year. I have very serious reservations as to the adequacy of the Department of Defense response to the kind of threat which was posed by having those living quarters within 80 feet of a fence. 
The Department of Defense had a report on June 13, 1996 from the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, Department of State, highlighting security concerns in the region in which Dhahran was located. Previously, in January 1996, the Office of Special Investigations of the Air Force issued a vulnerability assessment for the complex, and that assessment highlighted the vulnerability of perimeter security at the complex, given the proximity of the complex to a boundary fence and the lack of the protective coating mylar on its windows. And then, just 8 days before the terrorist attack, the Department of Defense received an intelligence report detailing a high level of risk to the complex. That report went to the highest levels of the Department of Defense and had the picture of Khobar Towers on it. 
Immediately after the incident occurred, the Secretary of Defense, William J. Perry, said that it was very unusual to have a bomb of the magnitude of 3,000 to 5,000 pounds used in the Mideast. I took issue with that statement on a factual basis that on October 23, 1983, according to the results of the Long Commission, a bomb weighing 12,000 pounds had killed 283 marines in Beirut, in the Mideast. That is the same region where, regrettably, terrorist attacks have become all too commonplace. So it struck me as strange that the Secretary of Defense would say that a bomb weighing 3,000 to 5,000 pounds was unusual in the Mideast, when there had been a bomb of 12,000 pounds, as I say, in 1983, detonated, giving tremendous warning for just this kind of attack; and that, in fact, a reading of the Long Commission report, for anybody who had read it, would have demonstrated the kind of threat which was posed by a high-powered bomb detonated near a fence in that area. 
I personally saw that fence in August 1996 when I visited Khobar Towers in Dhahran as part of my effort and the Intelligence 
Committee's efforts to try to find out exactly what had happened there. We had testimony from General Peay, who was the four-star commander in the area, who testified before a Senate committee in early July. Asked about the closeness of the perimeter fence to those living quarters, `Was it too close?' he said words to the effect of, `I don't know. I just don't know.' 
Certainly after the fact it is hard to understand how a ranking general would not know that that fence was too close to the living quarters and, realistically, before the fact, it seems hard to understand how the commanding general would not know about the extraordinary and unwarranted danger which was faced by the airmen who were living in those quarters. 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, had visited Dhahran in the spring of 1996 and was within sight of Khobar Towers, although, as I understand it, he did not actually visit Khobar. But a question to be raised and a question to be answered, which has not yet been answered by the Department of Defense, is why the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when in the area, within sight of Khobar Towers, knowing what the security risks were, did not take a look at that facility and make an assessment as to the vulnerability, since he was on the spot. That is especially true in light of the fact that there had been an attack in Riyahd, Saudi Arabia, in November 1995, killing a number of Americans, and that four Saudis had been executed by the Saudi Government in late May 1996, which would give rise to a concern as to what the militants in Saudi Arabia would do next. That was especially troublesome to the United States from a number of points of view, one of which was that the FBI, charged with investigating those matters overseas, had not been given access to those terrorists before they were executed. 
So, here you have the general on the spot, a brigadier general, with the fence 80 feet from the towers, you have the four-star general in command of the overall area even after the fact, not knowing whether there was an unacceptable risk, and you have the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the vicinity, within sight of Khobar Towers, and no corrective action taken notwithstanding all of these warnings which had been given in a number of contexts about the danger which was present there. 
Following the attack on Khobar Towers, a commission was formed with General Downing, a retired four-star general, in command. When he testified before the Intelligence Committee on September 19, 1996, among other questions I asked him about a series of criteria established by the Secretary of Defense, Secretary William J. Perry, about what the responsibility was of the Secretary of Defense. 
General Downing testified that even under Secretary Perry's two standards they were not met. The first two standards articulated by Secretary Perry were `establishing the policies and guidance for our commanders, including the policy and guidance for force protection.' 
I asked General Downing:  
. . . Was there an adequate policy and guidance on force protection? 
General Downing's response: 
No, there was not, Senator. 
Then I asked about Secretary Perry's second criterion, organizing and structuring the Department of Defense in such a way that force protection is optimal. Then the question was: 
So did they meet the second criterion which stated `organizing and structuring the Department of Defense in such a way that force protection is optimal?' 
General Downing: 
The answer is no.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in sequence, the committee then learned that there had been a report on the force protection issue, `Force Protection in Southwest Asia, An Air Force Perspective,' dated September 17. Our committee learned about this as a result of a report in the press, the Washington Post specifically, on October 10, 1996. So by letter dated October 17, 1996, Senator Robert Kerrey, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and I, in my capacity as chairman, wrote to Secretary of the Air Force, Sheila Widnall, asking for a copy of that report.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the next sequence of events was a letter which I sent to Secretary Perry, with a copy to Air Force Secretary Widnall, dated November 5, 1996, which reads as follows: 
This letter constitutes a formal complaint on the obstruction by you, others and the Department of Defense on the inquiry by the Intelligence Committee to determine whether there was an intelligence failure relating to the terrorist attack in Dhahran on June 25, 1996 on the following: 
1. Prohibiting key witnesses from being interviewed by this Committee (Brigadier General Terryl Schwalier, Colonel Gary Boyle, Lt. Colonel James Traister). 
Notwithstanding our efforts to interview these key personnel, the Department of Defense precluded the Intelligence Committee from conducting those interviews. 
Second, in my letter to Secretary Perry, I pointed out the concerns we had on prohibiting General Downing from testifying before the Intelligence Committee except on the terms set forth by the Secretary of Defense with that questioning only being in closed session. With our interest in having an open session, with General Downing having told the Intelligence Committee that he was employed by the Department of Defense and had to comply with instructions not to testify in open session, the impact of that was obvious. When General Downing testified in closed session that Secretary Perry had not even followed the Secretary's own criteria for force protection, it was not much of an impact contrasted to what it would have been had it been in open session. 
The third item: 
Refusing to give this committee access to an Air Force report which, as reported in the Washington Post on October 10. 
Then, finally, on November 6, after this letter was faxed on November 5, we received a response from General Trapp dated

Officials sympathetic to the Air Force position made available Wednesday selected parts of a classified review the Air Force conducted into the bombing. The review, written by Lt. Gen. James F. Record, commander of the 12th Air Force, cites, for example, the assessment of a senior U.S. intelligence official in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, that the intelligence reports given to General Schwalier `did not give a target' for the terrorist attack. 
So, by this time, some of the Air Force were dissatisfied with General Downing's report and wanted a report which would satisfy them. So another report had been commissioned, this time to be written by Lt. Gen. James F. Record. 
On seeing that additional news leak of the report, which the Intelligence Committee did not have a copy of, Mr. President, I then wrote to Secretary Widnall on the same day, December 12, noting the access by the New York Times but no access by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the next series of events, I note a story in the New York Times which, again, makes reference to these reports which the Intelligence Committee never had access to, quoting `Gen. Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, arguing that the case for accountability is nothing more than a Washington scalp hunt.' 
I then wrote, again, to Secretary of the Air Force, Sheila Widnall, on April 25, 1997, noting the comments by General Fogleman and again asking that these reports be made available to the Senate, to me, and to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, all of these letters to Secretary of the Air Force went unanswered. Then, on May 21 of this year, the Air Force had the responsibility of coming to the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I had an opportunity, finally, to ask Secretary Widnall these questions and why there had not been any response to any of these letters of inquiry and the question of General Fogleman on this subject. 
Finally, subsequent to that meeting, I received a very brief letter from Secretary Widnall, in fact, after I had bumped into her in the hallway on the 7th floor of the Hart Building and said to her, `Madam Secretary, why don't you at least respond to the letters saying that you can't respond if that is your point because there is an inquiry underway?' 
In the context of all the letters which had been written and that conversation, I finally received a letter saying she could not respond, the matter was being reviewed now by the new Secretary of 
Defense, and that, in due course, a copy of the report would be obtained by Senators. 
Here we are on July 7, 1997 and still no copy of the report has been made available to this Senator or, to the best of my knowledge, to other Senators, but copies of the report were made available to the news media as it suits the purposes of the Department of the Air Force and the Department of Defense. 
Mr. President, in offering this amendment, it is my hope we will have a statement of law requiring a report so we know what action is being considered in the future to protect personnel of the Department of Defense from terrorist attacks. News reports of the past week, an article in the Washington Post a week ago yesterday, reported the Secretary of Defense expected to make a finding sometime during the month of July. It is my hope that when the Secretary of Defense speaks on the subject, that he will go beyond the conduct of General Schwalier, which was criticized in the early report, and will pick up the issues of the conduct of the Department of Defense generally. 
Brigadier General Schwalier's conduct was criticized in the Downing report, but, to my way of thinking, that is not nearly enough of an answer as to the conduct beyond Brigadier General Schwalier, moving to a four-star general, moving to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, and moving to the Secretary of Defense himself, William J. Perry. 
In this context, it is my judgment that the record shows forcefully and conclusively that there were warnings all along the line; that when you have a fence 80 feet from living quarters of hundreds of Air Force personnel within easy distance of a large bomb, a bomb, according to defense estimates, the Secretary of Defense, of 3,000 to 5,000 pounds, substantially smaller than the experience of the 12,000-pound bomb in Beirut in 1983, that there was forceful, obvious, and conclusive neglect of duty. It goes beyond the brigadier general on the scene. It goes to the commanding four star general, it goes to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and it goes to the Secretary of Defense. 
If we are to have confidence in what the Secretary of Defense does in putting young men and women in harm's way, then there has to be accountability for the 19 airmen who died on June 25 in Khobar Towers and for the 400 who were wounded. That, Mr. President, is what I hope will come from the findings of the Secretary of Defense. 
In the meantime, this requirement for a report will be some help to the future. But if we permit on this record those responsible, those in the chain of command to go by unscathed, unreprimanded, unaccounted for, then it is a blank check and open invitation for this kind of conduct to be repeated in the future. 
The problems of terrorism are too serious to turn our back on what happened at Dhahran on June 25, 1996. I personally consider inexcusable that we have had more than a year pass and nothing has been said in an official way by the Department of Defense, the Department of the Air Force, and all of the components, this is to say nothing about who the terrorists are who have escaped punishment, and that is a matter which yet has to be reckoned with. 
But within our own Department of Defense, we have a right to expect better, and I, for one, am awaiting the report of the Secretary of Defense to see what the position of the Department of Defense is. But at least as to the future, we will have some indication as to what precautionary measures will be taken for the future, but there also has to be an answer for the past. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Santorum, I would like to discuss an issue with the chairman and the ranking member of the Finance Committee relating to operating losses of a business. 
The tax bill extends the carry forward period for businesses with operating losses for an additional 5 years. But the provision only applies to operating losses incurred in future years. 
We are less concerned about the tax impact of allowing existing losses to expire than about the impact on companies for financial accounting purposes. Under the accounting standards, if the operating losses expire, some companies will see a major reduction in asset value. 
We would like for the chairman and the ranking member to consider this issue in conference.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to explain my vote against waiving the Budget Act on the Kennedy amendment for an additional tobacco tax increase. I have long been a leading supporter of providing adequate health coverage to our Nation's children. On the first day of the 105th Congress, I introduced legislation that would provide coverage to the 4.2 million children of the working poor, who are not eligible for Medicaid but whose parents cannot afford private health insurance. During consideration of the budget for fiscal year 1998, the President and Congress reached an agreement to provide $16 billion for health care insurance to protect our Nation's uninsured children. The Senate Finance Committee has added an additional $8 billion for children's health insurance from funds derived from a new tax on tobacco. As a result, the budget reconciliation bill now contains $24 billion for the vital purpose of providing health insurance to America's uninsured children. 
The Kennedy amendment would further increase the tobacco tax by an additional 23 cents per pack. The amendment, however, did not specify how this additional tax revenue would be spent. As a consequence, the Senate could be given no assurance that any of the money generated by this new tax would provide health insurance. I believe the American taxpayer is willing to accept a reasonable level of taxation in order to provide health insurance to our Nation's children. However, with the money provided under the budget agreement and the additional funds provided by the Senate Finance Committee, Congress is fairly addressing this need.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I supported Senator Coverdell's amendment to expand the bill's provisions to allow penalty-free withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts for education expenses for children in grades K-12 because I believe that parents should have the maximum flexibility to spend their own money on their children's education. 
I have consistently opposed the use of public funds to subsidize private school tuition for K-12 educational expenses because I have grave concerns about the constitutional issues of separation of church and State raised in such policy and because I am an advocate of public schools. As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee which funds the Education Department, it is among my top priorities to continue to provide increases in Federal support to the Nation's public schools. However, there are many parents who feel that it is in the best interest of their children to attend nonpublic elementary and secondary schools for a variety of reasons and in a variety of settings. I believe they should be free to spend their own resources on such expenses as they see fit.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce the Affordable Child Care Act, which will ease the financial burden of child care for working families by reducing the cost of day care. I would like to commend Congressman Jon Fox from Pennsylvania's 13th District, who has sponsored this legislation in the House. Our bill would provide a tax credit for employers who provide on-site or site-adjacent child care to their employees in order to reduce the child care expenses of the employee. 
Many employees have expressed support for on-site day care facilities, which allow parents to spend more time with their children during the day, such as over the lunch hour. On-site child care may not be the best option for all families. Many families rely on relatives, centers operated by churches and other religious organizations, or make other arrangements to provide care for their children while they work. However, it is my view that this bill represents a good start toward reducing the cost of child care for many Americans. 
The need for affordable and accessible day care is critical given the increasing numbers of working parents and dual-income families in the United States. According to the Bureau of the Census, in 1975, 31 percent of married mothers with a child younger than age 1 participated in the labor force. By 1995, that figure had risen to 59 percent. Almost 64 percent of married mothers and 53 percent of single mothers with children younger than age six participated in the labor force in 1995. 
Yet, as reported by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on June 5, 1996, only 13 percent of all major U.S. companies provide some form of on-site day care. Further, it costs at least $1 million to start up such a day care center. About 70 percent of working parents missed at least 1 work day in the past year because of child-related problems, according to Work Family Directions of Boston, a company that advises firms on how to improve work and family programs. A 1991 estimate by the Child Care Action Committee, a national child care advocacy group, found that U.S. businesses lose $3 billion a year because of child care related absences. 
The cost of child care for families is also significant. A 1995 report by the Census Bureau showed that in 1993, the average weekly child care cost per arrangement paid by families with employed mothers was $57. Parents using organized child care facilities paid the most per arrangement at around $65 per week. Child care is even more expensive in metropolitan areas than nonmetropolitan areas, averaging $80 per week versus $55 per week. I know that licensed day care centers in some urban areas cost as much as $200 per week, which is quite a burden on families which need the second income. These figures serve to underscore the need for action on the part of the Federal Government to provide the necessary assistance to our Nation's working families. 
Accordingly, the legislation I am proposing today would provide a tax credit to businesses that provide licensed, on-site or site-adjacent child care for their employees. Employers would be eligible for a tax credit equal to 50 percent of the net cost of providing dependent care services at a child day care facility for employees. This bill also provides, however, that no credit shall be allocated unless the employer certifies that the amount of such a credit is passed on to the employees using the provider day care in the form of reduced child care costs. 
The Affordable Child Care Act complements my recent efforts to assist working families in a number of areas. When Congress debated welfare reform in 1995 and 1996, I worked to ensure that adequate funds were provided for child care, a critical component for 
welfare mothers who would be required to work to receive new limited welfare benefits. I am pleased that the welfare reform bill that became law provides $20 billion in child care funding over a 6-year period. 
Providing health insurance for children is also a top priority of mine, and I have sponsored legislation to establish a discretionary pilot program to cover the 4.2 million children of the working poor, who are not eligible for Medicaid but whose parents cannot afford private insurance. I am also a cosponsor of legislation introduced by my colleagues, Senators Chafee and Rockefeller, to expand the Medicaid Program to cover children whose families earn up to 150 percent of the Federal poverty level. 
To encourage the adoption of children into healthy and stable families, last April I introduced the Adoption Promotion Act of 1996 (S. 1715) with 13 other Senators to provide tax credits for families that adopt. Subsequently, a broader piece of tax legislation, the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, was passed by Congress and signed into law on August 20, 1996. This act included a $5,000 adoption tax credit for qualified adoption expenses and a $6,000 tax credit for special needs adoptions, and was much like our legislation. I recently reintroduced legislation to increase the tax credit for special needs adoptions for $7,500, and permit penalty-free withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts up to $2,000 for adoption expenses. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, encouraging businesses to provide affordable child care for their employees will help provide peace of mind to those in our Nation struggling to balance career and family. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation, and I urge its swift adoption.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce legislation that would provide a $2,500 tax credit for individuals or families with elderly family members living in the family home. As we all know, our Nation's population is living longer. With advances in medical treatment, improvements in the Nation's nutrition, and the development of drugs to combat infectious diseases, our Nation's elderly population is expected to more than double by the year 2050. This demographic change presents a unique challenge to America, and it is our duty to work together to ensure that our Nation's elderly and every generation of American families maintain a high quality of life. 
Since the Great Depression, our Government has instituted several extremely successful social insurance programs to protect the elderly. The Social Security Program has provided an income security net, and the Medicare Program has insured that senior citizens are afforded access to medical care. Many families, however, are faced with difficult decisions when elderly family members are no longer able to live alone. Many of these seniors are brought into the family home. Others are placed in institutional nursing facilities. 
While multigenerational families are not a new phenomenon in America, a new survey released by the National Alliance for Caregiving illustrates how contemporary multigenerational families are faced with extraordinary pressures. Nearly two of three individuals who provide 
care to elderly family members are employed full or part time, and about half have reported that their caretaking duties have made them late for work, forced them to come home early or to take time off. These caregivers spend an average of 18 hours a week taking care of loved ones, grocery shopping, managing their medications, and helping with transportation and personal care. Many people needing care are chronically ill. More than one in five caregivers, or about 5 million households nationwide, take care of someone with Alzheimer's disease, confusion, dementia or forgetfulness. 
Today, millions of American families face a no-win situation when an elderly family member is no longer able to live independently. Taking a loved one into the family home may be much desired instead of having to see a person impoverished by the Medicaid eligibility rules and left a ward of the State, living in a nursing home. Obviously, on the other hand, very few families can afford to pay for private nursing home care themselves. But, bringing an elderly relative into the family home is costly. Our public policy should recognize this dilemma and support those loving families seeking to care for the elderly with their own resources in their own homes. 
Currently, there are more than 33.5 million Americans who are 65 years of age and older. In my own State of Pennsylvania, there are 2 million individuals 65 years of age and older. Many of these seniors live independent lives. However, nationwide approximately 3.9 million of our elderly citizens live with relatives other than their spouse and an additional 1.7 million seniors live in nursing homes. My amendment would provide a $2,500 tax credit to individuals or families who care for an elderly family member in the family home. In order to qualify for this tax credit, the elderly family member would have to be at least 65 years old, would have to reside with their family at least half of the taxable year, and must have been eligible under current law to be claimed as a dependent on the family's tax return. 
With this amendment, families will be given the vital assistance necessary to provide care to seniors in their homes. It will also provide flexibility to families who would like to provide care to family members in their home rather than place these seniors in institutionalized care facilities, but are otherwise unable to afford this financial commitment. In Congress, we have made many speeches about strengthening the American family and about providing support for our Nations senior citizens. This bill would accomplish both of these important goals. I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of this bill to find real solutions to the real problems faced by the growing numbers of caregivers and senior citizens in America.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to explain my vote against waiving the Budget Act on the point of order raised by Senator Rockefeller yesterday concerning the provisions in S. 947 on balance billing in the Medicare Program. 
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 includes a new Medicare Choice Program, allowing Medicare beneficiaries for the first time to choose from a wide range of options for receiving their Medicare coverage, including traditional fee-for-service plans, private fee-for-service plans, provider sponsored organizations, medical savings accounts, health maintenance organizations, and preferred provider organizations. 
Within the context of Medicare Choice, there is an issue as to whether current law Medicare balance billing requirements should apply across the board. Under the Medicare Program, balance billing refers to the arrangement in which the Federal Government pays doctors at a given rate for treating a patient and doctors can charge up to a specific percentage above that amount. 
This legislation exempts from balance billing requirements the new private fee-for-service plans and medical savings accounts. If the Rockefeller point of order were sustained and the exemptions eliminated, doctors would be less likely to participate in the Medicare Choice Program's fee-for-service or medical savings account options because balance billing would cap their charges. As a result, seniors would have fewer options for medical care under this new program. I would note that under this legislation, no senior citizen would be required to choose any specific option, and each person can analyze all of the options to determine which best suits his or her individual health care needs. Further, balance billing will still remain in effect for the other options under Medicare Choice. Accordingly, in order to maximize choices for Medicare beneficiaries, I supported the motion to waive the Budget Act to overcome the Rockefeller point of order.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of Senator Rockefeller, Senator Santorum, Senator Snowe, Senator Collins, and Senator Campbell. It would ensure that $1.5 billion over 5 years of Medicare premium subsidies is provided to the low-income elderly with annual incomes up to $12,000 through expansion of the existing Medicaid Program, instead of what is in the current bill, to add $1.5 billion through a new State block grant program. 
This amendment is preferable, by doing it on an existing program instead of setting up a new bureaucracy. It is necessary because the premium increases in the bill are permanent, but there is no guarantee of permanent subsidies for the 3.2 million poor senior citizens covered unless this amendment would be adopted. 
I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Rockefeller.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is an amendment related to disproportionate share. Some States have been hit very hard because some of the funds have been used for mental health facilities. There has already been substantial improvement; illustratively, for Pennsylvania, which had been on the books to sustain a loss of $1.7 billion, it is down to $750 million. And the managers are now considering an amendment which would improve that situation materially. 
So I agree with my distinguished colleague from New Mexico to set it aside temporarily with the hope we may be able to work it out, and ultimately have it withdrawn if a satisfactory resolution can be arrived at.

In addition to teaching professionals, they give basic health services, customarily in the inner cities. With a disproportionate share coming into effect, their financing is very, very important. 
Beyond that, they give highly specialized patient care so that if you have some really extraordinary medical problem, where you go is to these graduate medical educational institutions. 
These cuts would be crippling. I suggest that as a matter of priority they be eliminated from this bill.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to address my vote on the Kennedy-Dodd amendment regarding savings to be generated from direct and guaranteed loan programs. Although, I have ardently supported efforts to increase Pell grants and improve the ability of millions of American families to afford a college education for their children, the Kennedy-Dodd amendment would have disrupted the guaranteed student loan program substantially. It would have upset the balanced approach in the budget agreement to derive savings equitably from both direct and guaranteed loan programs. 
I am advised that the Kennedy-Dodd amendment would create undue hardship on student borrowers by adversely impacting guaranteed lenders, which would lose part of their loan origination fees. 
I look forward to working with Chairman Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Dodd as the Senate considers these issues in the context of the Higher Education Act reauthorization later in the 105th Congress.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to explain my views concerning the Kennedy amendment 504, which would have immediately transferred to Medicare part B the home health benefits currently paid for under the Medicare part A trust fund. 
Payment for home health care is made from the part A trust fund for home health services such as part-time or intermittent nursing care provided by or under the supervision of a registered nurse or home health aide. 
To protect the solvency of the part A trust fund, the bill shifts some of the home health costs on a 7-year phased-in basis from part A to part B. 
The budget reconciliation bill reflects a careful compromise on protecting the solvency of the part A trust fund for all seniors without unduly burdening the taxpayers. Under the Kennedy amendment some of the bill's fiscal protections would have been dropped, and taxpayers would have effectively funded 100 percent of the home health services in fiscal year 1998, which would be unprecedented under Medicare. In my judgment that goes too far and adversely affects the present preferable balance.

I voted against both of those provisions on independent votes yesterday and continue to be concerned about their inclusion in S. 947.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to discuss programs proposed by the Americans Disabled for Attendant Programs Today, a group known as ADAPT, that is working to help people who are disabled live normal lives. 
There is a curious provision in the Medicaid laws, one of many curious provisions in the Medicaid laws, which does not permit people to live at home in community-based settings as opposed to being in nursing homes. I have sought to persuade the Secretary of Health and Human Services to change that program with a letter which I wrote to her on February 28, 1997, pointing out that `it has been brought to my attention that considerable savings to the Medicaid Program could be achieved by redirecting long-term care funding toward community-based attendant services, and by requiring States to develop attendant service programs meeting national standards to assure that all people with disabilities have full access to such services and can live at home.' 
When the Secretary came for a hearing, the question was propounded and the response has been that `HHS is currently considering such programs as a policy option but has not yet put them into effect. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is funding a demonstration program that will be operational next year, and the Department is looking toward the results of that program before acting.' 
It is my thought, Mr. President, that there is a clear-cut need for this kind of a program to be put into effect forthwith, and if the Department of Health and Human Services does not do so, then it may be necessary to enact legislation which would require the Department to act in that way. In the meantime, the appropriations subcommittee, which I chair, has increased the funding for the independent living program by some $2.1 million for a $74.6 million allocation this year. 
I had occasion earlier this year to visit a group of people who are living at home and told them that I would display on the Senate floor their sweat shirts and send to them a video cassette. Sweat shirts are very popular these days. This one says, for those who might not be able to read it on C-SPAN2: `Our Homes, Not Nursing Homes.' Underneath the logo is `ADAPT,' which is Americans Disabled Attendant Programs Today. 
They are a very courageous group. They are principally in wheelchairs, with very, very substantial disabilities, struggling to live independent lives and doing a great job at it. What they want is the flexibility to be able to live at home and to have home services. 
I think this is another area where Medicaid ought to have a little flexibility, understanding the needs of people. One way or another, Mr. President, we intend to get there and reasonably soon.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce legislation which will provide equitable treatment for families of passengers involved in international aviation disasters. I am very pleased that my colleague, Senator Santorum, is joining me as an original cosponsor of this bill. Companion legislation is being introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Joe McDade and 10 other members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation. 
As my colleagues know, the devastating crash of Trans World Airlines flight 800 on July 17, 1996 took the lives of 230 individuals. Perhaps the community hardest hit by this tragedy was Montoursville, PA, which lost 16 students and 5 adult chaperones from Montoursville High School who were participating in a long-awaited French Club trip to France. 
It has been brought to my attention by constituents who include parents of the Montoursville children lost on TWA 800 that their ability to seek redress in court is hampered by a 1920 shipping law known as the Death on the High Seas Act, which was originally intended to cover the widows of seafarers, not the relatives of jumbo-jet passengers embarking on international air travel. 
Under the Warsaw Convention of 1929, airlines do not have to pay more than $75,000 to families of passengers who died on an international flight. However, domestic air crashes are covered by U.S. law, which allow for greater damages if negligent conduct is proven in court. 
The Warsaw Convention limit on liability can be waived if the passengers' families show that there was intentional misconduct which led to the crash. This is where the Death on the High Seas Act comes into play. This law states that where the death of a person is caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default occurring on the high seas more than 1 marine league which is 3 
miles from U.S. shores, a personal representative of a decedent can sue for pecuniary loss sustained by the decedent's wife, child, husband, parent, or dependent relative. The act, however, does not allow families of the victims of TWA 800 or other aviation incidents to obtain other types of damages, such as recovery for loss of society or punitive damages, no matter how great the wrongful act or neglect by an airline or airplane manufacturer. 
My legislation would amend Federal law to provide that the Death on the High Seas Act shall not affect any remedy existing at common law or under State law with respect to any injury or death arising out of an aviation incident occurring after January 1, 1995. In effect, it would clarify that Federal aviation law does not limit remedies in the same manner as maritime law, and permits international flights to be governed by the same laws as domestic flights. 
My legislation is not about blaming an airline or airplane manufacturer. It is not about multimillion dollar damage awards. It is about ensuring access to justice and clarifying the rights of families of victims of plane crashes such as TWA 800. I am open to exploring with my colleagues the possibility of expanding the retroactive relief provided in this legislation, bearing in mind that many of the plaintiffs in cases arising out of previous airplane disasters, such as the Korean Air Lines 007 incident in 1983, have agreed to out-of-court settlements. 
The need for this legislation is suggested by the most recent Supreme Court decision on this issue, Zicherman v. Korean Airlines, 116 S. Ct. 629 (1996), in which a unanimous Court held that the Death on the High Seas Act of 1920 applies to determine damages in airline accidents that occur more than 3 miles from shore. By contrast, the Court has ruled that State tort law applies to determine damages in accidents that occur in waters 3 miles or less from our shores. Yamaha v. Calhoun, (1996 WL 5518) 
I believe it is inequitable to make such a distinction at the 3 mile limit in civil 
aviation cases where the underlying statute predates international air travel. I would note that the Gore Commission on Aviation Safety and Security noted in its final report this February that `certain statutes and international treaties, established over 50 years ago, historically have not provided equitable treatment for families of passengers involved in international aviation disasters. Specifically, the Death on the High Seas Act of 1920 and the Warsaw Convention of 1929, although designed to aid families of victims of maritime and aviation disasters, have inhibited the ability of family members of international aviation disasters from obtaining fair compensation.' 
I would further note that in an October 1996 brief filed at the Department of Transportation by the Air Transport Association, the trade association of U.S. airlines, there is an acknowledgment that the Supreme Court in Zicherman did not apparently consider 49 U.S.C. 40120 (a) and (c), which preserve the application of State and common law remedies in tort cases and also prohibit the application of Federal shipping laws to aviation. My legislation amends 49 U.S.C. 40120(c) to clarify that nothing in the Death on the High Seas Act restricts the availability of remedies in suits arising out of aviation disasters. 
At a time when so many Americans live, work, and travel abroad, taking part in the global economy or seeing the cultural riches of foreign lands, they and their families should know that the American civil justice system will be accessible to the fullest extent if the unthinkable occurs. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and look forward to working with them to ensure its ultimate enactment during the 105th Congress.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this resolution, being cosponsored by my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, and our distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun, is a resolution to recognize the importance of African-American music to global culture and to our Nation. 
This is especially important because this month of June is celebrated as Black Music Month, and the designation is particularly important to the city of Philadelphia, which is the home of the International Association of African-American Music. 
At the conclusion of the Civil War, military band instruments were abundant and could be purchased for petty cash or labor. It was during this time that the first age of African-American music, Ragtime, was born, and when Eubie Blake composed his famous `Charleston Rag.' Jazz artists flourished later, including W.C. Handy, Duke Ellington, and Count Basie. Dozens of African-American female singers contributed their talents as well--among them Bessie Smith, followed by Ella Fitzgerald. 
Today, African-American music's universal popularity and appeal is evidenced through the appreciation of other cultures. Non-African-American musical artists, such as Elvis Presley, the Beatles, and Bonnie Raitt, have cited African-American artists as inspiration for their own music. Globally, African-American music is appreciated for its impact on language, dance, art, and media, as well as social and cultural values. 
Its impact on our Nation's economy is just as great. The African-American music industry supports and creates countless jobs worldwide, from publishing companies to concert and club venues to advertisers. The Recording Industry Association of America reports that, in 1995, combined sales of what it terms `urban music'--including soul, dance, funk, and reggae--amounted to $1.4 billion. Furthermore, if jazz, gospel, and rap are combined--all genres in which there are significant African-American contributions--the total rises to nearly $3 billion. 
The work of Philadelphia's International Association of African-American Music helps to share the virtues of African-American music with people around the world. This resolution recognizes the work of those who help foster understanding of African-American culture through music, including the generations of African-American musicians whose talents have enriched America. 
It is my hope that the Senate will adopt this resolution. A companion resolution has been introduced in the House by Congressman Chaka Fattah and it has bipartisan support from 58 House Members. In conclusion, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this important recognition of African-American music.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support public disclosure of the overall funding law and would start with the language of the Constitution, which I believe supports that disclosure: 
No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time. 
On the base, that calls for public disclosure. I know some courts have limited that interpretation to what Congress says. But I believe, as a constitutional matter, disclosure ought to be made. And beyond that, as a public policy matter for the Congress, disclosure ought to be made. 
In the 8 years I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee--2 years as chairman--it seemed to me that much too much is kept secret, and disclosing the overall amount is not to disclose the programs. We have seen terrorism as the instrumentally for political purposes, replacing war. Intelligence is very important to fight terrorism, and I believe if the American people knew how much money was being spent on intelligence gathering, the people would want more spent and not less. 
Just yesterday, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee took issue with the way the Central Intelligence Agency is being run, saying it is not being run effectively. Much too much is being kept secret, Mr. President. We can protect important sources and methods and means from being disclosed, but still have a great deal more candor for the American people about what is going on in intelligence. When we look at the budget of the CIA or the FBI for domestic intelligence, those are items which ought to be subject to public debate. The public ought to be demanding more. The public ought to be receiving more. As a very basic first step, it is my sense--having some familiarity with the Intelligence Committee operations and overall budget--that the funding level ought to be disclosed. 
I thank the Chair and inquire how much of the 2 1/2 minutes is left.

Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, it is my hope that yet this afternoon we will be able to take action on legislation cosponsored by Senator Torricelli, Senator Nickles, and Senator Inhofe which would deal with the issue of eliminating veterans benefits for anyone who has been convicted of a capital offense. This legislation was introduced yesterday and is designed to deal with the situation of Mr. Timothy McVeigh, who last week was convicted of murder in the first degree on 168 murders arising out of the destruction of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City back on April 19, 1995. 
I was surprised to learn from my staff on the Veterans Affairs Committee that someone in Mr. McVeigh's situation would be able to receive veterans benefits. There are a wide variety of possible benefits. Exactly which ones apply to Mr. McVeigh would have to be determined, but they are benefits which would include employment training--obviously he cannot do that at the present time--education, other compensation, burial benefits. There was a gap in the law where someone who has been convicted of a number of crimes cannot receive veterans benefits--crimes like treason, sabotage, or espionage--but oddly enough, curiously enough, a conviction for murder in the first degree is not covered. 
Senator Torricelli had introduced legislation yesterday and so had I. I did not know this when I introduced my legislation and spoke briefly on the Senate floor yesterday afternoon about Senator Torricelli's legislation, but I found out about it later in the day and talked to him this morning, and we are coordinating our efforts to produce a joint bill. 
I discussed the matter yesterday with the majority leader, Senator Lott, who said he would work with us to have a prompt determination for the Senate, and we have put it on the hotline, and we are almost complete, with one Senator yet to respond, and there has been a checking now with the administration, with the White House, with the Executive Office of the President, and also with the Veterans' Administration to see if there is any objection. I do not believe that there will be any. 
It is my hope we would be able to take action fairly soon this afternoon, or, if we cannot, we may have to put it over until tomorrow. There has been considerable public interest and people expressing surprise that someone in Timothy McVeigh's situation could have veterans benefits and could, illustratively, be buried with heroes from the veterans wars of World War II, Vietnam, Korea, or the gulf war. 
So we are proceeding at this time. I wanted to alert my colleagues we are hopeful that bill will come up this afternoon and try to expedite the advice from both the White House and the Veterans' Administration as to their positions. It is my firm expectation that they will not have an objection but would rather welcome this legislation, but I wanted to inform my colleagues of the status at this time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SPECTER. First, Mr. President, I would like to update my colleagues on our efforts to have an amendment on veterans benefits occasioned by the conviction of Timothy McVeigh who does have veterans benefits. We have been working to put the legislation in final form, and I think we are now very close to it. If we can accomplish that, we still have time today to introduce the bill and, I think, to get a rollcall vote on it. That will be the final call, obviously, of our majority leader, Senator Lott, but I do think we have a chance to do that.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this bill would amend existing law to deny benefits to veterans who have been convicted of a Federal capital offense. Current law denies such benefits to veterans convicted of Federal crimes, such as sabotage, treason, and sedition, but not murder. 
I offer this bill on behalf of myself and my distinguished colleague from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli, and also Senator Byrd, Senator Nickles, Senator Inhofe, Senator Feinstein, Senator Campbell, and the distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Santorum. 
Mr. President, yesterday I was informed by staff in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, which I chair, that there is a gap in the law which allows Mr. Timothy McVeigh to be entitled to veterans benefits notwithstanding his murder of 168 persons, and his conviction for murder in the first degree in connection with his terrorist attack on the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. 
Frankly, I was surprised to learn of the current gap in the law which would allow him to claim veterans benefits. Those guilty of offenses such as sedition, treason, and espionage forfeit veterans benefits, but those who are guilty of murder in the first degree do not. 
The terrorist attack in Oklahoma City was the most heinous criminal act in the history of the United States of America, to my knowledge. It resulted in the murder of 168 persons, including many children. It also resulted in the wounding and maiming of hundreds of others who were in that building. 
Yesterday, Senator Torricelli introduced legislation similar to mine. We talked this morning, and we decided to join our efforts. Senator Lott consented to have the matter placed on the calendar for quick action. And we have had it now cleared by all Senators. 
I think this is a piece of legislation which ought to be adopted promptly. It would set a mark, saying that capital murderers, like those who commit espionage and similar offenses, forfeit a variety of veterans benefits. I cannot say exactly what benefits Mr. McVeigh might be eligible for--there could be a variety of possibilities, including education, employment or housing benefits. Certainly he would be entitled to burial benefits, under current law. It surely would be unseemly to have Timothy McVeigh buried in a veterans cemetery with heroes who served the United States of America. 
So I believe this is a fair piece of legislation. We ought to act on it promptly. 
I am pleased now to yield to my distinguished cosponsor, the Senator from New Jersey.  
Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce the Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence Education Act of 1997, and the Adoption Promotion Act of 1997. This legislation updates similar legislation which I introduced in the 104th Congress. The abstinence legislation is cosponsored by Senators Santorum, Bond, Inouye, Lugar, Warner, Biden, and DeWine, and the adoption legislation is cosponsored by Senators Santorum, Bond, Inouye, Cochran, and Harkin. 
This legislation, Mr. President, is directed at one of the most controversial and divisive issues confronting America today, and that is the issue of abortion. In my judgment, this is the most divisive issue confronting the United States since slavery. While I am personally very much opposed to abortion, I do not believe that it can be controlled by the Government. I think it is a matter for families, for women, for rabbis, ministers and priests, and it is essentially a moral issue. 
But I believe there is a consensus and general agreement on working toward the elimination of abortion which most Americans would find agreeable from all perspectives. I think that America is not pro-abortion, but there is a disagreement as to whether the choice of women can be controlled by the Federal Government. One area of agreement is that we ought to do everything we can to discourage premarital sex among teenagers, unintended pregnancies, and the abortions which follow. 
Senator Jeremiah Denton was a leading sponsor of abstinence education when he served in the Senate, and in 1987, more than a decade ago, I took up Senator Denton's cause in maintaining funding for abstinence education in the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. Last year, as chairman of that subcommittee, we increased the funding for abstinence education very substantially, but there has not been an authorization bill for some time. This legislation would call for an authorization up to some $75 million a year. I think we are not going to be able to get there in the immediate future, but I think that is a target where we ought to have authorization to give the Appropriations Committee ample room to work. 
I have visited schools around the country. I have found it very much to the point to talk in very direct and candid terms to teenagers in schools about the problems of drugs and about the importance of abstinence, and there is an interest I think among teenagers in wishing to discuss it in an open and frank way. What young women need is to have counter peer pressure which would move toward abstinence. 
On Friday, March 15, 1996, I had the opportunity to kick off the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Week at Central High School in Philadelphia. During that week, communities throughout Pennsylvania conducted special activities to promote pre-marital abstinence as the healthiest way to prevent teen pregnancy and the many other physical and emotional consequences of early sexual activity. 
Last April, I visited Carrick High School in Pittsburgh, where I met with students who are involved in an abstinence program. I also visited the Susquehanna Valley Pregnancy Service in Lancaster, which works with young people who have taken pledges of abstinence and counsels them on overcoming peer pressure with counter peer pressure. I met and discussed abstinence and other issues with students at Susquehanna Township High School in Harrisburg, Manheim Township High School in Lancaster, Cedar Cliff High School in New Cumberland, Central York High School in York, and Liberty High School in Bethlehem.

Mr. SPECTER. The legislation I am introducing today builds on the significant progress made in the 104th Congress, where we enacted tax credits for adoption and authorized, through the welfare bill, an additional $50 million for fiscal years 1998 to 2002 to provide abstinence education. As my colleagues may recall, I introduced similar legislation in the 104th Congress on April 29, 1996. 
At the outset, let me provide my colleagues with a brief summary of the legislation. My first proposal would reauthorize and expand the Adolescent Family Life Program, providing $75 million annually to promote abstinence education for teens. My second proposal would increase the tax credit for adopting special-needs children to $7,500 and would permit penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts for adoption expenses. These two bills 
complement my efforts to advocate adequate prenatal care, especially for teens, through the Healthy Start Program. We know that in most instances, prenatal care is effective in preventing premature births. I saw my first 1-pound baby more than a decade ago. It is really a startling sight, a child no bigger than my hand, carrying scars for a lifetime and costing as much as $400,000 in medical care per child over a lifetime, according to the most recent data from the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality. 
Mr. President, nearly 200 years ago, the French writer Alexis de Tocqueville is said to have observed that `America is great because she is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.' His analysis is timeless. 
It is impossible to be a public official today, to travel throughout States such as Pennsylvania and elsewhere in the United States, without recognizing that America's problems are more moral than material. As we have tried to steer toward a growing economy and a balanced budget, we have seen a growing consensus that all our goals must rest on a restored ethic of personal responsibility. A crisis of values, in fact, underlies many of the public policy problems the Senate addresses on a daily basis. This has impressed upon me the need for people of strong moral commitments to enter public service and public debate, so that we may confront the underlying problems together and move our Nation forward. 
While the news media offer us a monthly snapshot of leading economic indicators, it may be that our leading moral indicators are more telling, such as the staggering number of teenage pregnancies and the rapid rise in juvenile crime, which suggest that the erosion of the American family continues unabated. Further, today more than 50 percent of American marriages end in divorce, meaning that millions of children face at least some instability in their home environment. Marriage is obviously important in that a strong family structure, based on a commitment of mutual support and respect, is vital for children. On the subject of family values, I speak with considerable pride about the manner in which my parents and my siblings have respected the institution of marriage. In addition to my own marriage of 44 years and my parents' marriage of 45 years, my brother, Morton, and his wife, Joyce, were married for 51 years until his death in 1993. My sister, Hilda, and her husband, Arthur Morgenstern, celebrated their 54th wedding anniversary in April 1997. My sister, Shirley, was married to Edward Kety for 46 years until his death in 1995. My son, Shanin, and his wife, Tracey, celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary on June 29, 1996. So our family totals 250 years of marriage, and counting. 
On this critical question of the health of America's families, the grim statistics are worth airing. The number of teenage pregnancies in the United States continues to reach alarming levels. According to data compiled by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, in 1992, the most recent year for which statistics are available, approximately 931,000 women aged 15 to 19 became pregnant. Further, the National Center for Health Statistics reports that there were 500,744 births to women aged 15 to 19 in 1995, and an additional 12,318 births to women under 15 years of age. By comparison, the United Nations Population Division reports that the United States teenage birth rate, 64 births per 1,000 females aged 15 to 19 for the period 1990-95, is the highest in the industrialized world. France and Japan report some of the lowest teenage birth rates, at 9 and 4 births per 1,000 females, respectively. Another leading moral indicator is the rapid increase in the number of unwed teenage mothers. According to Child Trends, Inc., the percentage of births to mothers under age 20 that occurred outside of marriage rose from 48 
percent in 1980 to 76 percent in 1994. 
Teenage mothers face more complications in childbirth, and their children are 50 percent more likely to be born premature. These children also have a greater risk of dying in the first year of life, suffering developmental problems, and becoming teen parents themselves. Further, the Office of Population Affairs of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports that 80 percent of children born to unwed teenage mothers who have not completed high school live in poverty. By contrast, of those children born to 20-year-old married parents who are high school graduates, only 8 percent live in poverty. In addition, more than three-fourths of unmarried teen mothers began receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children [AFDC] within 5 years after the birth of their first child. A report released in 1996 by the Robin Hood Foundation estimated that adolescent childbearing costs the taxpayers $6.9 billion each year in welfare and food stamp benefits, medical care expenses, lost tax revenue, incarceration expenses, and foster care. To me, this necessitates a strong response from concerned citizens, the clergy, and public officials. 
We can, and we must, confront our leading moral indicators head-on. We must press harder in the fight to reduce the alarming number of teenage pregnancies in the United States. And, when a child comes into the world as the result of an unintended pregnancy, we must do all that we can to ensure that it is raised in a loving, stable family environment. It is the American family, of course, that chiefly bears these responsibilities. Nonetheless, I believe that the government can play a role and that we in the Congress must pursue legislative avenues to strengthen the social fabric and family stability of our Nation. 
My first legislative proposal, the Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence Education Act of 1997, would reauthorize the existing Adolescent Family Life Program, known as title XX, a valuable program which focuses directly on the issues of abstinence, adolescent sexuality, adoption alternatives, pregnancy, and parenting. If you want to reduce the number of abortions performed in the United States, teaching children to resist negative peer pressure is a starting place. 
In 1981, Congress, with bipartisan support, established the Adolescent Family Life Program as the only Federal program of its kind. The program was reauthorized in 1984, and its authority expired in 1985. Since then, the program has been funded through annual appropriations bills. As chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I pressed to appropriate $14.2 million for the Adolescent Family Life program in fiscal year 1997, an increase of $6.5 million over fiscal year 1996. Within that amount, $10.8 million is provided for abstinence demonstration programs. 
A major focus of the Adolescent Family Life prevention projects is delaying the onset of sexual activity, thereby reducing the incidence of adolescent pregnancy as well as the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. Investing in programs that prevent unintended teenage births to unwed mothers is also vital in this time of budgetary constraints. Addressing the problem of teenage pregnancy, which alone costs the government about $6.9 billion each year, will save millions of dollars in welfare costs. 
Since its inception, the Adolescent Family Life Program has supported approximately 196 care and prevention demonstration projects and 63 research projects. On April 10, 1996, I met with officials at Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh, which has received a 2-year, $1 million grant to create a care network to meet the physical, emotional, psychological, and educational 
needs of pregnant and parenting adolescents, and to expand upon school-based education programs. The results there have been significant. 
Now, more than 10 years after the authority for this valuable program expired, it is vital that Congress reauthorize the Adolescent Family Life Program to stem the staggering emotional and financial cost of teenage pregnancy. My legislation, the Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence Education Act of 1997, would authorize $75 million in Federal spending annually between now and fiscal year 2001 for the Adolescent Family Life Program, substantially higher than the $30 million authorized in 1985. My legislation would also amend title XX of the Public Health Service Act to state expressly that the education services provided by the recipients of Federal funds should include information about abstinence. 
Updating Federal law to expressly advocate abstinence education provides necessary guidance to the Department of Health and Human Services. I have also proposed amending the law to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that approved grants reflect a geographic diversity with adequate representation of both urban and rural areas. Further, to address concerns raised by Pennsylvania constituents, my legislation would establish a simplified, expedited application process for groups seeking title XX demonstration project funding of less than $15,000. I urge my colleagues and others to join me in the effort to reduce teenage pregnancies and make America a good society by supporting this legislation. 
The legislation on adoption, Mr. President, builds upon legislation I introduced last year with my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, who is the principal cosponsor on both of these bills. Our legislation, and there are many others in the field, provided for a $5,000 tax credit for adoption. There are many children in America who need homes, and many people in America who would like to adopt, but it is a very, very expensive proposition. I was pleased that Congress adopted legislation last year providing a $5,000 tax credit for adoption, $6,000 in the case of a special needs child, and this legislation would build on that to provide for an additional $1,500 for special needs children, for a total of $7,500. Another provision in this bill would allow for a $2,000 withdrawal tax free from individual retirement accounts. 
Far too many children are left to grow up in foster care without ever experiencing the rewards of being a permanent family member. When couples find that they are not able to conceive their own children or that it is not medically advisable, many consider adoption. Many other couples blessed with their own children consider adopting another child out of a sense of love and community, particularly where a child has been in foster care. 
Recognizing that the costs associated with adoption can be prohibitive, Congress passed the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 last August, which provided a nonrefundable tax credit for qualified adoption expenses, such as reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other expenses related to a legal adoption. The act also contained a tax exclusion for benefits received under employer-sponsored adoption assistance programs. Both the tax credit and the exclusion of benefits are capped at $5,000 per child, or $6,000 per child in the case of a special needs adoption, and are fully phased out for adjusted gross incomes above $115,000. During Senate consideration of this legislation, I wrote to Majority Leader Dole and Finance Chairman Roth urging the inclusion of a $7,500 tax credit for special needs adoptions, rather than $5,000 as contained in the House-passed bill. I was pleased that the final bill included a higher level of $6,000 for special needs adoptions, but this is just not enough. 
We should be doing more to encourage, in particular, the adoption of children with special needs. Under current law, a child with a special need is one who has a mental, physical or emotional handicap, or who falls into a specific age, gender or minority group, which requires assistance to place that child with adoptive parents. This clinical explanation belies the frustrating condition of these children. A New York Times op-ed column by David S. Liederman, Executive Director of the Child Welfare League of America, published on May 9, 
1996, stated that there are some 21,000 children with special needs waiting to be adopted, and another 65,000 in the care of welfare agencies, awaiting legal clearance to be made available. Many of these children have been placed in foster care because of parental neglect and abuse, exposure to drugs or HIV infection, serious emotional and physical disabilities, and other problems. These children, especially those with physical disabilities, are often very expensive to raise, which further compounds the difficulty of placing them in adoptive families. 
The legislation I am introducing today, the Adoption Promotion Act of 1997, would increase the tax credit and the exclusion of benefits received under employer-provided adoption assistance for special needs adoptions from $6,000 to $7,500. While it is often much less expensive to adopt a special-needs child than a typical infant, related costs may arise, such as the remodeling of a house to accommodate a physically handicapped child. Increasing the tax credit and exclusion to $7,500 will help to defray such additional expenses. 
Finally, I have included a provision in my legislation to allow the penalty-free withdrawal of up to $2,000 from an Individual Retirement Account [IRA] to help cover the costs of adoptions. I understand that a tax credit is simply inadequate to cover all the expenses associated with adoption, and I believe the Federal Tax Code should encourage savings and reward taxpayers, rather than penalizing them for the wise use of their hard-earned money. I have supported other efforts in the past that would allow the use of IRA funds for personal capital expenses such as the purchase of a family home, investment in college education, or payment of medical expenses. In my judgment, using IRA funds for adoption expenses is equally meritorious. 
Given the substantial prior support in both the Senate and House for tax incentives to promote adoption, I am hopeful that my colleagues will favorably consider the mix of incentives contained in the Adoption Promotion Act of 1997 and enact this legislation in the near future. By reducing the financial hurdles to adoption, I hope we will be able to give new hope to the thousands of children who live in foster care awaiting the chance to be brought into a loving family environment on a permanent basis. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in restoring the health of America's families by supporting the Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence Education Act of 1997 and the Adoption Promotion Act of 1997. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of these bills be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am submitting this resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of India's independence. This resolution will designate August 15, 1997, as `Independence Day for the Nation of India,' a day of celebration of Indian and American democracy. 
On August 15, 1947, India came into existence and has been dedicated to democracy and the rule of law for the past 50 years. It is a multiethnic country of 950 million people, who speak more than 18 major languages and hundreds of dialects. 
I have had the pleasure to visit India on a number of occasions, most recently with the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Senator Brown, in August 1995, when we met with Prime Minister Rao. That was a fascinating meeting when the Prime Minister immediately undertook a discussion of the necessity to have the subcontinent nuclear free. Regrettably, there has been much controversy, much tension between Pakistan and India. On that occasion, Prime Minister Rao emphasized his desire to see the subcontinent nuclear free. 
The next day, Senator Brown and I had occasion to visit with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in Islamabad and talk to her about establishing a nuclear free subcontinent. 
Later, Senator Brown and I wrote jointly to President Clinton urging that the President invite the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan to the White House to see if a nuclear free subcontinent might be accomplished with the assistance of the good offices of the United States. 
I am delighted to see my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, assuming the Chair, the lofty position of presiding over the U.S. Senate. I am glad to see my colleague here. 
Back to my resolution. India's democracy has thrived over the past 50 years, testimony to the fact that principles of freedom are not limited to the most prosperous countries of the West, but a country which has become independent and democratic, notwithstanding its problems with its economy. 
There are strong links between the two nations, India and the United States. We are both former British colonies and, in our own civil rights struggles of the last generation, great Americans, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, borrowed the concepts of peaceful dissent from India from the teaching of India's independence leader, Mahatma Gandhi. 
The number of Indian, Americans living in the United States continues to increase steadily. The rich cultural heritage and traditions of the Indian people contribute to the great diversity of the United States of America. 
Relations between our countries have seen some difficulties, and there are still areas for improvement, but our mutual values of democracy and the rule of law bridge these differences. 
I submit this resolution because it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the Indian people and to reaffirm the democratic principles which our two great nations cherish. I ask the American people to join with me in celebrating 50 years of India's independence.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am considering pursuing an amendment which would take a firm stand against the terrorism of the Palestinian Authority, Chairman Yasser Arafat, and I have thought through the possibility of offering an amendment on this bill. But after consulting with members of the Administration, I have decided to await a remedy of reprogramming, with my option remaining to offer this amendment on the foreign aid bill which will be marked up in the Appropriations Committee this week and offered on the floor sometime in the near future. But I do want to make a comment or two about it, as to what I think needs to be done on the modification of U.S. law as it relates to funding for the Palestinian Authority. 
In existing law, under an amendment offered by the Senator from Alabama, Senator Shelby, and myself, the $500 million in aid to the Palestinians, the Palestinian Authority is conditioned on a maximum effort by Chairman Yasser Arafat and the Palestinians to fight terrorism and also to change the PLO charter to rescind the provision calling for the destruction of Israel. Certain events have occurred in the immediate past which, in my view, raise a question as to whether there is compliance with the Specter-Shelby amendment and whether there is a need for further statutory language to act against terrorism which has been promoted by the Palestinians. 
The two specific matters that I have referred to are the bombing of the Tel Aviv restaurant resulting in the murder of three Israelis and the wounding of many more on March 21, 1997, where Prime Minister Netanyahu made a statement that Chairman Arafat had given a green light for that act of terrorism. When Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, was before the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations Appropriations a few weeks ago, I questioned her about that, and she said that there had not been a green light, but said that Arafat had not given a red light either. 
I do not want to become involved in what shade of amber, what shade of red, there is in using the expression of `lights given by Chairman Arafat.' But I believe it is indispensable, if the United States is to give assistance to the Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority, that there be a maximum effort made by the Palestinian Authority and by Chairman Arafat to stop terrorism. Short of that, it is my view that we ought not to be providing U.S. funds. 
The amendment that I have in my hand that I have been considering offering--I have had discussions with the distinguished chairman and ranking member and members of the Administration--calls for conditioning payment to the Palestinian Authority on the determination by the State Department that Chairman Arafat did not act in a way which failed to give a red light to stop terrorism. 
The second factor of concern to me is a report by Deputy Minister of Education of Israel, Moshe Peled, that Arafat had knowledge of the proposed bombing, a terrorist act against the Trade Center in 1993, which resulted in the killing of six United States citizens and the wounding of many, many more people, and that, if in fact that allegation is true, then Arafat--Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. May we have the Senate be in order please?

Mr. SPECTER. If it is in fact true that Chairman Arafat had knowledge of that proposed bombing before it occurred, that would make him an accessory before the fact and a co-conspirator and subject to extradition under the so-called long-arm statutes which we enacted in 1984 and again in 1986. I think that ought to be done. 
Upon learning about Chairman Arafat's possible knowledge of that bombing, I wrote to the Attorney General, asking for an 
investigation, received back a vacuous answer from a subordinate, wrote again asking for a detailed investigation, and I am awaiting a response from the Department of Justice on that point. 
The amendment which I have been considering offering on this bill and may offer on the foreign aid bill would condition payment to the Palestinian Authority on the determination by the Department of Justice that Chairman Arafat was, in fact, not involved, having prior knowledge of the Trade Center bombing. At the conclusion of my remarks, I will make part of the Record, the exchange of correspondence on this issue. 
I then placed a telephone call to Moshe Peled, the Deputy Minister for Education of Israel, to find out more about his assertions. I found out that he spoke Hebrew and not English, and I spoke English and not Hebrew. Then I had one of my deputies, David Brog, who speaks Hebrew, talk to him. The upshot of that conversation was that Mr. Peled stood by what had been reported but referred us to Israeli authorities to find out more about it. That, obviously, is a matter for the Department of Justice, perhaps for the Department of State. It is my view that before we make these payments, there ought to be a certification that Chairman Arafat was not in fact involved as an accessory before the fact nor was he a co-conspirator having knowledge of that matter. 
In conversations with the Administration, it may be that this objective can be achieved by a reprogramming of the funds which are going to the Palestinian Authority, some $10 million, and that this would, in fact, not affect some of the other funding going to the infrastructure, which is not in Chairman Arafat's control and not in the control of the PLO or the Palestinian Authority. It may be that my objective can be achieved without offering this amendment. 
I am informed by the distinguished Senator from Delaware that my proposed amendment is opposed by the Administration, and the President was sending a letter over, because it would complicate the peace process. If the Administration is prepared to deal with the Palestinian Authority and Chairman Yasser Arafat in the context where there are outstanding allegations that Arafat was an accessory before the fact or a co-conspirator on the Trade Center bombing, then I think the Administration is dead wrong. If the Administration is prepared to deal with Arafat, give him U.S. money in a context where he has given a green light or has failed to put up a red light, there again, I think they are dead wrong--maybe totally wrong. Dead wrong would be a bad expression, in the light of all the people killed by PLO terrorists. 
In any event, I am prepared not to resolve the issue this afternoon in light of the fact that we may be able to accomplish it by reprogramming and in light of the fact that we may be able to bring the matter to a head if it is necessary for the Senate to vote on the foreign aid bill, which will be up before the Senate in the very near future. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, which I chair, we have been considering the situation of Mr. Timothy McVeigh, who has certain entitlements as a veteran. Curiously, the committee has concluded that a conviction for murder in the first degree does not significantly affect Mr. McVeigh's entitlements or benefits as a veteran. 
Veterans who are convicted of certain criminal offenses forfeit their benefits. Those offenses, however, are limited to convictions for mutiny and aiding the enemy; spying; certain national security crimes, such as treason, sabotage, disclosing classified or defense information, interfering with the Armed Forces during a time of war, communications of classified information by a Government employee to an agent of a foreign government; and certain nuclear material crimes, such as the unauthorized possession or transfer of nuclear material or receipt and communication of restricted data. 
Surprisingly, my staff on the Veterans' Affairs Committee has concluded that Mr. Timothy McVeigh would be entitled to veterans benefits, notwithstanding his conviction on 11 counts including the murder of some 168 people in the Oklahoma City bombing of the Federal building. He remains eligible for such benefits, including burial benefits, since he was not convicted of any of the crimes I just listed. 
Because of that, I now introduce legislation which would deny veteran benefits to any person who is convicted of a State or Federal capital offense. The specific provision would be: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who is convicted of a Federal or State capital offense is ineligible for benefits provided to veterans of the Armed Forces of the United States pursuant to title 38, United States Code. 
This bill would prevent Mr. McVeigh from having any veterans benefits in light of his conviction on 11 counts, including murder in the first degree. I send this bill to the desk and ask that it be filed with the appropriate authority.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to announce my cosponsorship of the Domenici-Bond Women's Business Centers Act of 1997, which will reauthorize this valuable program administered by the Small Business Administration's, the SBA's, Office of Women's Business Ownership. 
Women-owned businesses are a major driving force for America's economy. As of 1996, there were nearly 8 million women-owned businesses nationwide, employing more than 18.5 million people and generating close to $2.3 trillion in sales. According to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, women-owned businesses are growing faster than the overall economy in each of the top 50 metropolitan areas in the United States, including Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In a study released in March 1997, the foundation reported that as of 1996, Philadelphia's 127,100 women-owned enterprises employed 448,500 people and generated over $56 billion in sales, and Pittsburgh's 54,800 women-owned enterprises employed 141,800 people and generated over $17 billion in sales. These numbers are truly impressive and highlight the significant impact of women in business on Pennsylvania's economy. 
Established through the Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988, the women's business centers have been vital in providing services and programs that support and accelerate women's business ownership. My constituents are fortunate to be served by the Women's Business Development Center, located in Philadelphia. Since its formation in July 1995, the center has provided information, business assessment, training, and counseling sessions to over 3,000 prospective, emerging, and established women business owners. It is critical to reauthorize the activities of these centers to ensure that women-owned businesses have the resources necessary to prosper and grow. 
Specifically, the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997 would double the authorized appropriation for the women's business centers to $8 million, authorize 5 years of project funding for new centers, extend funding for existing centers for an additional 2 years, and modify the Federal funding match requirements to facilitate self-sufficiency of the centers. 
This legislation complements my efforts on behalf of minority and women-owned business enterprises. On April 23, 1997, I reintroduced the Minority and Women Capital Formation Act, S. 635, which provides targeted tax incentives for investors to invest equity capital in minority and women-owned small businesses, as well as venture capital funds dedicated to investing in minority and/or women-owned businesses. 
I also worked to secure a $500,000 grant through the Small Business Administration in fiscal year 1997 to support the activities of the National Education Center for Women in Business, located at Seton Hill College in Greensburg, PA. The center promotes women's business ownership by conducting collaborative research, providing educational programs and curriculum development, and serving as an informational clearinghouse for women entrepreneurs. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support swift adoption of the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997 so that we can meet the needs of America's emerging women business owners, which are critical to the economic health of our Nation.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem during the Six-Day War. I congratulate the residents of Jerusalem and the people of Israel on this important anniversary day. 
On June 5, 1967, the Israelis responded to threats from their Arab neighbors and 6 days later the war ended with a reunified Jerusalem that once again gave Jews access to the old city and its holy sites. Some called this unexpected price of war a miracle; it is indeed an issue of great importance for the Jewish people. 
Jerusalem holds a special place in Jewish history. Since King David, Jerusalem has been at the center of Jewish traditions and the very core of Jewish faith. The very city itself, not just the sites of religious significance, is considered hallowed by those of the Jewish faith. This issue has personal significance to me as well, as members of my own family live and worship in Jerusalem. 
Jews have long been the majority of residents of Jerusalem. However, Jerusalem is not only important for the Jewish faith, but for Islam and Christianity as well. I am a cosponsor of the sense-of-the-Congress resolution that recognizes the significance of a unified Jerusalem to the people of Israel and reiterates the Senate's position that Jerusalem must remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected. 
This resolution also calls on the President to publicly affirm as a matter of United States policy that Jerusalem must remain the undivided capital of Israel. Since coming to the Senate, I have supported initiatives that recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. I also supported the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Implementation Act of 1995, legislation that will move the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. I will continue to work to ensure that never again will access to the old city and its holy sites be denied to Jews or to persons of any faith. 
Mr. President, I join my colleagues on this momentous day in celebrating the triumph of Israel in the Six-Day War and the reunification of Jerusalem.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in 1992, I sponsored a joint resolution in collaboration with Congressman Louis Stokes, who served as chairman of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, to expedite disclosure of materials relevant to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. That act created the Assassination Review Board, which was directed to oversee the identification and release of records related to the assassination of President Kennedy. While the review board has made significant progress in its important work, it will need additional time to complete its task. Today, I am introducing a bill that will authorize the board's extension for 1 year. 
Through October 1996, the review board was successful in transferring nearly 10,000 documents to the National Archives and Records Administration for inclusion in the JFK Collection. Although much has been accomplished, Congress, in setting its original 3-year timetable, was simply unable to anticipate a number of problems the board has encountered since beginning its work. The board was not appointed until 18 months after the legislation was signed into law. In addition, Federal agencies have been slow in identifying records to be processed and the hiring and training of new employees to work with the board has taken longer than expected. Nevertheless, the review board serves a vital function of removing some of the uncertainty and speculation about the contents of Government files relating to President Kennedy's assassination. An additional year will permit the board to finish its important task. 
According to information provided to me, over the past 5 years, the review board has worked to facilitate the maximum appropriate disclosure of any additional materials which may have been withheld by the FBI, CIA, Secret Service, or any other Federal agency. 
In addition, the House committee decided to withhold certain materials for 50 years following the publication of its report in 1979, or until the year 2029. According to information provided to me, the review board has also worked to facilitate the maximum appropriate disclosure of any of these materials which may have been withheld by the House committee.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is a very important amendment because it will determine whether we will have an increase in NIH grants and, in fact, whether we will have NIH grants at their current level. 
Night before last, by a vote of 98 to 0, this body passed a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which increased NIH grants by $2 billion. But the fact is that the 550 account on health is cut by $100 million. This amendment asks the Senate to put its money where its mouth is. If the sense of the Senate which passed two nights ago is to have any sense, this amendment has to be agreed to. 
I understand that the leadership is opposed to this amendment. I understand that there is an argument that nothing we do here on this budget resolution amounts to anything; that it is all up to the appropriators. In a sense, that is correct. But I believe the appropriators will be influenced by a positive vote here, especially when the leadership is going to try to defeat this amendment. 
If this amendment is defeated, I can explain to the constituency groups who come to me as chairman of the subcommittee that there was no money. But if this sense-of-the-Senate resolution for $2 billion is to be understood, this amendment has to pass. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment adds $1.1 billion to function 550, which is the health function, for fiscal year 1998, with an offsetting $1.1 billion reduction in nondefense discretionary functions, which would hold Federal agency administrative costs to 96 percent of the estimated 1998 level. 
The offset constitutes a reduction in nondefense spending of four-tenths of 1 percent. This four-tenths of 1 percent could be accommodated by reducing administrative costs only 4 percent, so that the net effect would be to have Federal administrative costs reduced by 4 percent to 96 percent of the estimated 1998 level. 
This amendment is being offered, Mr. President, because the Senate yesterday adopted, by a vote of 98 to nothing, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to increase spending for the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion. And while that sounds good, to those who are unaware of the inner workings of the Senate, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution does not have any real effect but just says what we would like to have occur. This amendment will be directed toward having hard dollars placed in the budget resolution for the National Institutes of Health. I am offering this amendment on behalf of Senator Harkin, Senator Mack, Senator D'Amato, Senator Jeffords, Senator Inouye, Senator Collins, Senator Hutchison, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Reid. 
Mr. President, there is a general acceptance that the National Institutes of Health has been one of the real treasures of the U.S. Government, making enormous advances in the most dreaded diseases which we face today. There have been enormous advances in cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, enormous advances in Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, more recently in schizophrenia; a new generation of AIDS drugs are reducing the presence of the AIDS virus and HIV-infected persons to nearly undetectable levels, and the phenomenal work being done by the National Institutes of Health has led to a consistent rise in funding for that agency. 
Since becoming chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, we have raised the funding for NIH by some $643 million in fiscal year 1996. We have raised the funding for the National Institutes of Health by $820 million in fiscal year 1997, but this year we are faced with a reduction in the health account. So that if this budget goes forward, and this budget signifies what funding will be available for NIH, there will be a cut in all health accounts and accordingly, on a pro rata basis, a cut on the National Institutes of Health. 
The total allocation and funding for the health account, account 550, was frozen from last year at $25 billion, and in this budget it is in at $24.9 billion, or, as I say, a cut of some $100 million. 
This is $400 million short of what the President's original budget mark was for 1998, and over $3 billion short for the 5-year budget period. The budget would cut the health account by some $2.2 billion through the year 2002. But, most importantly, from the point of view of what we are doing here today, we have the President coming forward with a budget increase of some $400 million, and this account is now cut by $100 million. 
If this is left to stand, Mr. President, we will have the anomalous, or hard-to-understand situation where the Senate has said we ought to increase the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion, and then when it comes to my committee where I chair and have the responsibility for establishing the mark, suddenly we will find not only no money for an increase, but the account is cut by $100 million. So, on a pro rata basis, there would have to be a decrease. 
We find this at a time when other accounts have increases in spending. Defense spending rises by $3.2 billion in fiscal year 1998; international affairs rises by $900 million in fiscal year 1998; energy rises by $400 million in fiscal year 1998; natural resources and environment rises by $1.3 billion for this year; commerce and housing goes up $300 million; education and training goes up $4.3 billion; administration of justice up by $1.4 billion, the general Government rises by some $800 million. But no one has come to the floor on any of these lines and has said there ought to be a $2 billion increase. The only line in the items which I have just spoken about would be defense. But for the National Institutes of Health, yesterday we had a spirited presentation with many speakers saying NIH ought to go up by $2 billion. The reality 
is it is all Confederate money unless there is some allocation which is more than a sense-of-the-Senate or our very best wishes but a specific amount which has a specific offset. 
That is, in itself, somewhat of an oversimplification, but that is very close to the reality. The whole budget resolution, in a sense, is an expression by the Senate, by the Congress of what we ought to have done, contrasted with the specific appropriations bills which are then legislated and then ultimately signed by the President. 
I conferred with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee after talking this over with the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, and Senator Domenici said, well, you better see how Senator Stevens is going to respond to it. And Senator Stevens says we need to have the hard dollars through the budget process. So that if the National Institutes of Health is to avoid having a cut, this amendment is going to have to be adopted. 
It goes without saying that as one Senator who chairs a certain subcommittee, I am bound by the will of the Senate. If the Senate says in this vote that the National Institutes of Health is not to have an increase but, in fact, is supposed to have a decrease, to the various interest groups who want breast cancer to be funded, who want prostate cancer to be funded, who want Alzheimer's to be funded, who want heart disease to be funded, who want AIDS to be funded, then I can say I went to the floor and I laid the case on the line--and I am not totally without experience as an advocate--and the Senate said, no, we are not going to increase the funding for the National Institutes of Health. I have a specific offset, and that is administrative costs that go down 4 cents on the dollar. I think that administratively you can cut 4 percent. It is four-tenths of 1 percent across all discretionary nondefense budgets, but it comes out of, could come out of 4 cents on the dollar on administrative costs. 
If the Senate says that on Wednesday night we said put it up $2 billion, that is what we would like to see, but when the Senate faces the hard choice and has to put its money where its mouth is, a sense-of-the-Senate amendment is where the Senate's mouth is. This budget resolution is where the money is. If the Senate says we are not going to put our money where our mouth is, that is on the record. And when people say NIH did not get an increase, it is because the Senate turned it down. 
So this is an opportunity for the Senate, bluntly speaking, to put its mouth where its money is. Mr. President, we have only 1 in 4 approved grants funded, and we have people dying as we speak from cancer, dying as we speak from heart disease, dying as we speak from many, many ailments. The National Institutes of Health has been our very best capital investment in the health of the American people. 
That, in effect, lays it on the line in just a very few moments. So at this point I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I appreciate the answer from my distinguished colleague from Texas. But I ask him if he would cut the Social Security administrative costs which total some $6 billion or cut the Medicare administration costs or if he would cut the job training programs or student aid or Pell grants? 
I understand that, in posing this question to the Senator from Texas, it is not possible for him to give a very meaningful answer without having the list before him, but I suggest at the same time that when he says we could quadruple the accounts because we have $60 billion; we had $74 billion last year and the funding was very, very short. And contrary to what the distinguished Senator from New Mexico says, that we are just talking about expressing a wish and a hope, that the accounts are going to be set by the appropriators, that really is not so. 
When the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the full committee, sits down for the 602(b) allocations, what the Budget Committee has done will be very, very important. When the Senator from New Mexico says that we can make allocations, yet at the same time has stated that there are protected accounts on education that cannot be utilized for the health account, it is just a little bit 
inconceivable to this Senator how the Budget Committee comes up with the 550 account which is less than a freeze on last year's account. The reality is that there will not be the funds for us to make an allocation for the National Institutes of Health. 
If this amendment passes, there will be a statement from the U.S. Senate to the Appropriations Committee that there ought to be an increase by $1.1 billion, which will net out to about $1 billion for NIH, and that when you go through, as the Senator from New Mexico did, and specify what the costs will be other places, that it is doable to have a cut of 4 percent in administrative costs. The administrative costs are $25 billion today. Nobody can tell me that you cannot cut 4 cents out of a dollar on administrative costs. 
What we did last night in talking about a $2 billion increase for NIH is `talking about it.' What we are doing now is putting our money where our mouths were last night. 
If the Senate votes this down, then there is a ready answer that this Senator will have because I have the responsibility as chairman, Senator Harkin has the responsibility as ranking member, of saying what we are doing. On this date of the record, it looks like there is going to be a $2 billion increase. 
How does the American public, how do the people understand what the sense of the Senate is? You say it is the sense of the Senate. Is there a sense? Yes, there is a Senate. Does the Senate have any sense? Well, not really if you pass a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which does not mean anything; $2 billion. Does the Senate have any sense? Well, not if you pass a sense-of-the-Senate resolution which is vacuous and meaningless. 
This is the money. Where is the money? It is in this amendment. If you do not pass this amendment, fine. I have a way to tell the people who want breast cancer to be financed, there is not the money. The Senate voted no. I have a way to say to the people who wanted money for mental health, there is no money to increase mental health. 
The fact is that there has to be a pro rata cut. You have less in the 550 health account. There is no way to have an increase for inflation. Now, if that is sense, then the Senate does not have any sense. 
How much time remains, Mr. President?

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, beyond the assurance as to where the money is going to go, there is money there, so that if there needs to be a reallocation, there will be some funds that can be allocated. 
The subcommittee has the responsibility for job training, student aid, Pell grants, LIHEAP, the Center for Disease Control, child care, Social Security administrative costs, Medicare, and a long list of items which have very, very high priority. And when the Budget Committee returns to the health account less money than it had last year, obviously, there is no money for NIH because the other items have been cut to the bone as it is. 
The last 2 years Senator Harkin and I consolidated or eliminated 134 programs to save $1.5 billion to put into NIH and to put into education. And the additional funds here are on projected programs. 
So it is a very clear vote. It is a vote as to whether we want to put our money where we spoke so eloquently last night on $2 billion or whether we want to have NIH unable to have an inflation rise and, in fact, have a pro rata cut. 
How much time remains, Mr. President?

As the distinguished chairman knows, there has to be an offset. I chose an offset which I think is realistic. When the distinguished Senator from New Mexico says the appropriators are going to do whatever they want to do, I wonder why we are here at all. Why have we been spending the last 2 days on a budget process that does not mean anything? The fact is that it does mean something. 
When the Senator from New Mexico says, call on the subcommittee chairman of Veterans' Affairs, how about the chairman of Veterans' Affairs? I chair the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Let me tell you, it would be a boon to that committee to have this researched. 
Now the question is whether there is going to be any sense of the Senate at all, and if there is, this amendment will be adopted.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the impact this budget agreement will have on America's veterans, and to express my concerns that funding assumed under the agreement will not be sufficient to provide for adequate health care for America's veterans. 
If it is approved, the budget resolution will require the Committee on Veterans' Affairs [VA] to report legislation which will reduce entitlement spending, over a 5-year period, by $2.7 billion compared to the budget baseline. That sounds like, and is, a substantial sum. However, I believe the committee will be able to meet this goal by extending the expiration dates of savings provisions already enacted as part of prior deficit reduction measures, and by agreeing to round down to the nearest dollar future cost-of-living adjustments. 
No one is happy that controlling the deficit requires restrained growth in mandatory-account spending for veterans' benefits. But I am confident that the committee will be able to meet its mandatory spending instructions in such a way as to ensure that no provision in the final reconciliation bill will result in a veteran who receives a benefit this year not also receiving the same benefit next year. Indeed, even after the committee has complied with its reconciliation instructions, spending for veterans' benefits from mandatory accounts will increase each year the budget agreement is in effect. 
I am also pleased that the proposed budget resolution permits the committee to report legislation which will allow VA to retain money it collects from private health insurance carriers when VA treats the nonservice-connected illnesses of veterans who have health insurance. Under current law, VA is required to bill insurance companies when it treats the nonservice-connected illnesses of insured veterans. However, VA is required to transfer the money it collects to the Treasury. Allowing VA to retain the money it collects will provide a real incentive for more efficient and effective collections. 
However, the administration proposed its health insurance proceeds retention provision with a hook. The President, in requesting the authority to allow VA to retain health insurance proceeds, also proposed that VA receive, initially, a cut in appropriated funds for VA medical care and that appropriations be frozen at that reduced level over the succeeding 4 years. historically, VA has needed an increase of almost a half a billion dollars a year just to pay for VA employees' cost-of-living salary adjustments and for the increased costs of medical supplies and equipment. 
In its April 24, 1997, `Views and Estimates' letter to the Budget Committee, the Veterans' Affairs Committee expressed its serious concerns about the wisdom of relying on an untested source of revenue--insurance collections--for a program as critical as veterans' health care. I continue to have that concern. 
The budget resolution now before this body is even worse than the President's initial proposal. It does not merely carry forward the President's proposal to cut appropriations for VA medical care, and then maintain that reduced level of appropriations for 5 years. Under this proposal, VA discretionary spending in 1998 will be $400 million less than it was in fiscal year 1997, and $3.1 billion less than current levels over the 5-year term of the agreement, even after allowing for retained health insurance collections. 
The cost of providing health care for veterans consumes over 417 billion of $18 billion plus in VA discretionary spending. Almost all of the rest of VA discretionary spending is expended on construction, medical research, and for the salaries of VA employees who process veterans' disability claims. There are no unimportant discretionary accounts with VA's budget. According to VA, each 4100 million pays for about 1,400 VA care givers, and for care for about 22,000 veterans. 
In February, 1997, Dr. Kenneth Kizer, VA's Under Secretary for Health, announced an initiative to increase the number of veterans VA treats by 20 percent and to reduce VA's cost per patient by 30 percent. In time, reforms in the delivery of VA care may enable VA to absorb real reductions in health care funding. But those reforms have not yet taken root. Further, it takes money to make money. According to VA, reforms needed to achieve Dr. Kizer's ambitious goals will cost money to implement. If Congress reduces VA medical funding before VA's reforms are implemented, we should not be surprised if VA's goals of increasing the number of veterans treated, and reducing the average cost of treating each patient, are postponed or even abandoned. I believe that would be a false economy, and a tragedy for our veterans. 
I recognize that discretionary spending assumptions are just that assumptions. The actual decisions will be made as the Congress debates and enacts appropriations bills to fund discretionary programs. The Appropriations Committee always faces heavy pressure to ensure adequate funding for VA medical care. This budget resolution will only increase that pressure. 
Mr. President, 26 million American veterans will watch to see how--and if--the Congress will rise to the challenge presented by the discretionary spending assumptions affecting the VA in this budget resolution. I will fight to assure that adequate funding for veterans' health care is provided. In my estimation, appropriations for discretionary spending on veterans' programs, which are assumed under this budget agreement, are not sufficient. I intend to work hard, as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and as a member of the Appropriations Committee, to correct this inequity.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to once again address the subject of religious persecution. I have stood here before describing the horrible tragedies occurring in many parts of the world. Sadly, very little has been done to combat the problem. That is why I am introducing the Freedom From Religious Persecution Act of 1997. 
Religious persecution is a subject of great personal interest. Both of my parents, my father from the Ukraine, my mother from a small town on the Polish-Russian border, came to this country to avoid religious persecution. Freedom from religious persecution is a concept fundamental to the ideals of this country and to peoples everywhere. 
Christians and other religious minorities have been and continue to be the victims of discrimination, rape, torture, enslavement, imprisonment, and even murder, because of their religious beliefs. This persecution continues today, often without diplomatic or other consequences for the offending regime. Christians are not the only ones being persecuted. Muslims and followers of other religions are also singled out for their beliefs. 
In January 1996, the White House promised that a new senior advisor position would be created in the Office of the President dedicated specifically to the issue of religious persecution overseas. No such position was ever created. Instead, President Clinton established a committee in the State Department that will report to the Secretary of State and will advise the Secretary on violations of religious freedoms abroad. The committee has since met, months have gone by, but still no action has been taken. Mr. President, I and many of my colleagues agree that the time for action is now. We do not need more reviews and studies or more advice on the subject. 
The instances of religious persecution are well documented. We need action. 
At the end of the 104th Congress, I introduced Senate Resolution 283, which discussed the need for quick, decisive action and called upon the President to appoint a White House advisor on religious persecution. After that, I worked with Senators Nickles, Nunn, and Coats on a broader Senate Concurrent Resolution, 71, which included my provisions on a White House Senior Advisor on religious persecution. Senate Concurrent Resolution 71, which I cosponsored, passed the Senate by voice vote but there was insufficient time remaining in the 104th Congress to secure passage in the House. 
So today, the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities continues to grow, often without diplomatic or other consequences for the offending regime. In countries such as Saudi Arabia, Sudan, China, and Ethiopia, Christians are systematically denied their religious liberties. Muslims have also been singled out for persecution in countries such as Burma, where Muslims are forced to relocate to undesirable areas and where Muslims are often denied educational opportunities. 
Several examples illustrate the gravity of the problem. The Sudanese Government continues to essentially wage a war against its Christian population. Reports detail the forced enslavement and conversion of the Christian populations from the southern regions of Sudan. The Government bombs and burns Christians villages, has taken more than 30,000 Christian children as slaves in the last 6 years, and tortures Christian worshipers and their priests. 
In Pakistan in February of this year, thousands of Christians were attacked, many houses and six churches were set on fire. Nearly 1,000 families were living in tents after being driven from their homes by rioters. Where was the Government to stop this terror? Where were the police? 
Persecution of Christians is by no means limited to the Islamic world. China continues to be one of the worst offenders. At least 75 million Christians live in China but cannot practice their religion. Roman Catholics and Protestant Chinese are imprisoned and tortured for holding worship, preaching, or distributing bibles without permission. 
This past August 1996, I traveled to China and met with Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen to express my strong concerns about religious persecution in his country. On September 12, 1996, however, Chinese Premier Li Ping released a statement warning the Chinese people that the free exercise of their religious faith could result in harsh retribution. 
In August 1996 I also visited Saudi Arabia and met with Crown Prince Abdullah to discuss the restrictions that country has on religious practices. I was deeply troubled by the fact that United States troops stationed in Saudi Arabia are not permitted to exercise their religious beliefs or even fly the American flag. According to the Pueblo Program on Religious Freedom of Freedom House, the Saudi Government has even insisted that the United States Government restrict Christian worship by American citizens on United States Embassy grounds in Saudi Arabia. American officials have apparently acquiesced to some of these demands by, for example, restricting Christian services at the Embassy in Riyadh and prohibiting Christmas services for United States troops defending Saudi interests during the gulf war. 
Other examples of such persecution of Christians and other religious minorities abound. Earlier this year, I discussed the broad issue of religious persecution on the `Capitol Enlightenment' radio show in Virginia with host Bill Fenton and Jim Jacobson, president of Christian Solidarity International, and on `The Diner' cable television show in Pittsburgh, hosted by Tom Hinkling. The public response to these programs and my legislative efforts to 
combat religious persecution has been overwhelming. People from across the country have contacted me to urge me to continue the fight until Christians, Muslims, Jews, and others can practice their faith in any country without fear of reprisal. 
The time has come for the United States to stand up for the right of all people to enjoy the fundamental freedom of religious faith. That is why I am introducing legislation with Congressman Wolf that will establish the position of Senior Advisor to the President dedicated to combating religious persecution overseas. 
This legislation will also define degrees of religious persecution and will impose sanctions on offending entities. Degrees of religious persecution are defined by two categories of activity. The first is when religious persecution is ongoing and widespread and is carried out by the government or with the government's support. The second is when there is religious persecution that is not carried out with government support, but where the government fails to take serious efforts to eliminate the persecution. 
The legislation will ban exports to the specific foreign government entity that carries out the persecution. These sanctions would take effect immediately upon the identification of the relevant entities and products. Additional sanctions would take effect after 90 days or 1 year depending on the level of persecution. In addition, the legislation includes immediate sanctions against Sudan, a country where religious persecution is particularly egregious. 
This legislation requests more than just another report by the State Department. It is serious and it is tough. This legislation commits the United States to real action. There is no more time for talk. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be inserted into the Record.

Mr. SPECTER. I wish to add my voice and tribute to our distinguished President pro tempore on his magnificent record, and comment about how much I have admired his work as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
When I joined this body after the 1980 elections, a few days after the November election, in 1980, I was sitting in my bed in Philadelphia and the telephone rang and that distinguished southern 
voice said, `This is Strom Thurmond calling. I wonder if you would be willing to vote for me for President pro tempore.' I was really amazed since Senator Thurmond did not need my vote that he would call and ask for my vote. 
While I served with him on the Judiciary Committee I found him to be very wise. One of the comments he made soon after I joined the committee, when a judge was up for confirmation, was asking the nominee if the nominee promised to be courteous. I thought that was sort of a meaningless question until Senator Thurmond followed up after the nominee said yes by saying, `The more power a person has the more courteous that person should be.' There is a lot of wisdom in that short statement. Whenever Senator Thurmond is not present and I am, I make that statement to the nominees. 
During the first 4 years of my term here, Senator Howard Baker, the majority leader, used to keep us all night, and on many occasions I would join Strom for a bowl of soup for about an hour, and I have listened to some of the most fabulous stories because Senator Thurmond is a legend, having been here when John Kennedy was a Senator, when Lyndon Johnson was a Senator. 
I shall tell one very brief story. After Senator Thurmond ran on the Dixiecrat ticket in 1948, in the Presidential motorcade Inauguration Day in 1949 Senator Thurmond rode in an open car with his wife. Senator Thurmond tells a story of when he passed by the reviewing stand of President Truman and Vice President Barkley. Senator Thurmond stood up, took his hat off and bowed. And Vice President Barkley started to wave to Governor Thurmond. And I shall not tell the whole story, but President Truman pulled down Vice President Barkley's hand with a comment, which is a remarkable story. 
I asked Strom on a number of occasions if I could be his biographer. He should have a biographer, if he does not take the time to write his own. It is too bad, on this very busy occasion of the Senate, that there are not more Senators on the floor to hear the remarkable accolades presented by our noted historian and conscience of the Senate, Senator Byrd, and by the senior junior Senator, Senator Hollings, but I wanted to have my words of admiration for Senator Thurmond on this very auspicious occasion.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution because the results of the National Institute of Health have been dramatic, really stunning. We have seen dramatic breakthroughs in heart disease, in breast cancer, in prostate cancer, in ovarian cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, new generations of AIDS drugs are reducing the presence of the AIDS virus in HIV-infected persons to nearly undetectable levels. With respect to the variety of cancers, the death rates have begun a very, very steady decline. Most recently we have made enormous progress as well in schizophrenia. 
The accounts on the National Institutes of Health have risen consistently over the past decade and a half. Regardless of whether the chairman of the subcommittee was Senator Weicker, Senator Chiles, Senator Harkin, or myself, a position which I now hold, we have found the money for very, very substantial increases in the funding for NIH. Last year we had an increase of some 6.9 
percent for a total of $820 million. The year before, $643 million. I commend my colleague, Senator Mack, for his leadership in first offering a resolution early on to double NIH funding over the next 5 years, and the resolution tonight, to add $2 billion to NIH funding. 
I suggest that we need to go a step beyond the sense-of-the-Senate Resolution, and if I might attract the attention of the distinguished manager of this bill, Senator Domenici, in supporting this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, I wish to point out that the figures, while well intended, to express the views of the Senate, are not binding in terms of what will occur. The reality is, of course, that nothing is binding. The whole budget resolution is, in a sense, the sense of the Senate. Now there are some parts which are protected, as Senator Domenici has explained, under an agreement between the congressional leadership and the President. Those, however, require the confirming by the entire body, and that may not happen and they are subject to a veto if that does not happen, but in the very broad sense we express in this budget resolution what we would like to see done. 
Now, at a later point in the budget resolution I will call upon my distinguished colleague from New Mexico to support an amendment which I will offer which will add $1.1 billion to the 550 function, which surprisingly has been reduced in the resolution now before the Senate. Under a freeze, that figure is set at $25 billion and in the budget resolution it is at $24.9 billion. 
So, notwithstanding the very impressive presentation made by my colleague from Florida, he is talking about Confederate money. If we are to have real money in order to present this to the Appropriations Committee, in a discussion I have had with the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, we are going to have to have real dollars put in an offset. As much as I would like to see $2 billion as suggested by Senator Mack I do not know quite how to get there with an offset, but I think this is admirable. 
I suggest to my colleagues that if we take four-tenths of 1 percent from discretionary nondefense, a total of some $258 billion, we will have $1.1 billion. That sum of money would enable us to have an increase in the NIH budget, something in the neighborhood of $950 million, which would be hard cash and something which is really very, very, badly needed. 
When we talk about the number of grants provided through NIH, we currently have some 27,000 research project grants, 878 center grants, nearly 15,000 training grants. But even at that, only one in four approved grants are funded. 
Now, beyond NIH, we will face in this subcommittee LIHEAP, Low-Income Energy Assistance. I know my distinguished colleague from New Mexico has been a leader on mental illness, and he will be coming to the markup and will be making a very valid, very impassioned plea, as he has done each year. If I could continue to have the attention of my colleague from New Mexico, 
each time he as come to me as chairman--and we have had rotations as to who is the chairman of which subcommittee--and each time Senator Domenici has come to me, I have said, `Yes. Pete. Yes, sir.' He is right. But if I am to be able to say that as chairman of the committee, we are going to have to have some hard dollars. For Senator Domenici's recommendation, I had a discussion with Senator Stevens, and he said, `I will follow Pete's lead, but we are going to have to have more than a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.' 
I know my distinguished colleague from New York is standing beside me. I want to yield the remainder of my time because I think there is going to be a very persuasive argument offered by my colleague, Senator D'Amato.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce legislation that would reauthorize and expand upon existing Federal mass transit programs. My legislation, the Mass Transit Amendments Act of 1997, is intended to lay the groundwork for the Senate's consideration of mass transit legislation in the context of reauthorizing the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. Substantial increases in Federal spending on mass transit are warranted, notwithstanding current budget constraints, because a greater commitment to public transportation is in the national interest. I would note, however, that this legislation is an authorization bill which does not increase the deficit; funds authorized to be spent out of the mass transit account of the highway trust fund would still be subject to the annual appropriations process, which is subject to the discretionary spending caps set in the budget resolution and the 602(b) allocation process. 
Transit should not be viewed as a partisan issue or a regional issue. This bill recognizes the valuable role transit plays in reducing our energy dependence, protecting our environment, reducing gridlock, and providing access to jobs, schools, and health care facilities for millions of Americans in urban and rural areas throughout the Nation. In particular, I urge my colleagues to review my proposed reverse commute pilot program, which would authorize $250 million annually in new grants targeted at improving access to employment for residents in economically distressed urban areas and rural communities. 
This bill is intended to encourage the Banking Committee, led by Chairman Alfonse D'Amato and Senator Paul Sarbanes, to report to the Senate legislation which will preserve much of the ISTEA transit program but at increased funding levels which reflect the importance of mass transit to our economy, quality of life, and environment. I look forward to working with Senator D'Amato, Senator Sarbanes, and others on the Banking Committee and Appropriations Committee who want to improve the Nation's transit systems through the ISTEA reauthorization process. 
This legislation takes into account the transit industry consensus proposal put forth by the 
American Public Transit Association (APTA), which represents transit systems, large and small, in all 50 States. I am pleased to note that APTA's new president is Bill Millar, whom I had the pleasure of working with for a number of years when he was the executive director of the Port Authority of Allegheny County. 
In preparation for the ISTEA reauthorization process and the annual appropriations process, I have met with many individuals in an effort to learn more about the needs of transit systems, the towns and cities in which they operate, and the riders they are trying to serve. In recent months, I have discussed strategies to increase transit funding with Gov. Tom Ridge, Senator Rick Santorum, and Chairman Bud Shuster. In addition, I have visited with Jack Leary, the general manager of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), Mayor Tom McGroarty of Wilkes-Barre, and representatives of the Pennsylvania Public Transportation Association. I have also met with transit system officials during my regular visits to Pennsylvania's 67 counties. 
I am particularly pleased to be introducing this bill with my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum, who has joined with me regularly to increase support for public transportation, such as when we unsuccessfully offered an amendment to the fiscal year 1996 Transportation appropriations bill to restore $40 million in Federal operating assistance. Both Senator Santorum and Gov. Tom Ridge recognize the vital role mass transit plays in Pennsylvania and have worked with me to maximize the Federal resources available to urban and rural transit systems in our State. 
I am also pleased that Senator Frank Lautenberg has joined in this bipartisan effort. For two years, Senator Lautenberg has joined me in co-chairing an informal Senate transit coalition, which has served as an information clearinghouse for Senate transit supporters and their staffs and which will play an even greater role, I hope, during the reauthorization process. 
For some time, I have addressed an ongoing threat to our Nation's security and prosperity, a 
threat with dual roots--in the precarious Middle East and right here at home. As I stated in a speech on the Senate floor on January 30, 1997, I am very concerned by our nation's increased reliance on potentially unstable foreign sources of oil and believe it is critical that during the 105th Congress, we focus on increasing energy conservation. 
I have been troubled that United States imports of foreign oil continue to increase from the current 50-percent level, with 20 percent of our purchases coming from the Arab countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC]. According to the American Petroleum Institute, we import more than 9 million barrels per day, with a 6-percent increase in 1996 alone. This is a huge jump from the 6 million barrels imported per day in 1973. Further, if these trends continue, analysts say in ten years we will look overseas for two-thirds of our energy needs. 
In part because of the ready availability of less expensive sources of foreign oil, it has not been cost-effective for U.S. energy companies to increase domestic production. Further, the effectiveness of the strategic petroleum reserve has dwindled because it only holds an amount comparable to 75 days of foreign imports, a situation that was not helped by the Clinton administration's decision last year to sell off approximately 25 million barrels of petroleum from the reserve to generate revenues. 
The timing for selling our reserves was less than prudent, particularly considering the state of affairs in the Middle East today. Saudi Arabia, in particular, poses unique cause for concern. If a hostile nation seized Saudi oil wells, the largest reserve in the world, the American economy and world markets could tumble. The deplorable June 25, 1996, terrorist attack at the Khobar Towers facility in Dharhan, which resulted in the murders of 19 airmen and the wounding of more than 400 United States personnel, also gives cause for concern because there is a strong possibility of links to internal domestic struggles in Saudi Arabia. Pressure is mounting from politically activist and conservative Islamic movements to undermine the ruling monarchy, who are viewed by some to be too liberal and western. If American access to Persian Gulf oil cannot be guaranteed, then the United States must 
reduce its dependence on foreign oil. 
While reducing our dependence on foreign oil is a difficult task, we can achieve meaningful reductions in energy consumption by promoting the use of public transportation. On the significant link between energy consumption and our transportation infrastructure, a Department of Transportation study of the 50 largest urban areas in the United States suggests that nearly 4 billion gallons of gasoline a year are wasted due to traffic congestion--approximately 94 million barrels of oil. There is much at stake, for the annual economic loss to businesses in the United States caused by traffic congestion is estimated at $40 billion by the Federal Transit Administration. 
Mass transit has developed to include traditional bus and subway lines, commuter rail, cable cars, monorails, water taxis, and several other modes of shared transportation. Public transportation is a lifeline for millions of Americans and deserves substantial funding for that reason alone. However, it deserves even greater funding when one considers that public transportation saves 1.5 billion gallons of fuel consumption annually in the United States and that each commuter who switches from driving alone to using public transportation saves 200 gallons of gasoline per year, according to government and private studies. 
Transit also does much to protect our environment. For example, on May 12, I visited the site of the proposed Frankford Intermodal Center in Philadelphia, which will be built on the site of the existing Bridge-Pratt terminal. At present, the terminal serves 40,000 El passengers daily, translating into 17,600 fewer cars on the road each day and mitigating the release of 16,500 pounds of pollutants into the city's air. The new facility is expected to attract new ridership, taking more cars off the streets and reducing pollution even further. But, without increases in transit capital assistance programs, projects such as the Frankford Center will be difficult to get off the drawing boards. 
There are ample other reasons to increase our commitment to transit funding. In our States, citizens and communities depend on good public transportation for mobility, access to jobs, environmental control, and economic stability. Public transportation lets the elderly visit their health 
care providers, shops, or friends. In rural areas, buses are essential to reduce isolation and ensure economic development. Also, children use public transportation to go to school. Without affordable mass transit, people in America's inner cities can't get to work. Under the welfare reform law enacted last year, there are expectations that most individuals receiving welfare benefits will find gainful employment. If they can't afford to get to work, or bus routes are cut, we are just making it that much harder for them to get off welfare. It should also be noted that millions of Americans have jobs in the transit industry, operating and maintaining buses and subways, manufacturing vehicles, and constructing new facilities. 
I am troubled that some have proposed freezing Federal transit spending around $4.4 billion. Transit systems depend to a great degree on Federal assistance in order to remain viable. A survey by my staff of 18 Pennsylvania transit operators shows that they receive an average of 26.7 percent of their total operating and capital funding from the Federal Transit Administration. In addition, SEPTA receives 15 percent of its overall funding from the Federal Government--55 percent of its capital funds--and the Port Authority of Allegheny County receives 32.9 percent from FTA. Reductions in Federal operating and capital support cannot necessarily be made up by local sources. Further, if the systems must cut routes, increase fares, and let their facilities fall into disrepair, they will lose the critical mass of riders needed to sustain operation. The Department of Transportation has calculated that $13 billion in annual transit capital spending is needed just to preserve current conditions--$7 billion more than current capital expenditures--demonstrating the great need to increase, rather than freeze, Federal support. 
Responding to this need, my legislation includes several provisions to strengthen our transit systems and enable them to respond to our society's growing need for efficient and affordable public transportation. 
First, the bill reauthorizes transit programs for 5 years at a total of $34.4 billion through fiscal year 2002. For fiscal year 1997, total transit appropriations are $4.3 billion. Under my bill, 
the fiscal year 1998 authorization would be $6.5 billion and this figure would be adjusted up for inflation through fiscal year 2002. The authorization is based on calculations of available gasoline tax receipts in the mass transit account of the highway trust fund, considering past surpluses and the additional revenue stream that would be created by diverting a portion of the 4.3 cent per gallon gas tax increase from 1993 into this account. While the $6.5 billion figure may seem substantial to some, I would note that Congress enacted in ISTEA in 1991 a $7.45 billion authorization for fiscal year 1997 in recognition of the importance of investing in public transportation. We have been remiss in not meeting the ISTEA authorization levels. We must do better under its successor legislation. 
Under my proposal, discretionary capital grants for new starts, rail modernization, bus acquisitions, and bus facility construction would rise from the current $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1998. Formula capital grants would rise from current $2.2 billion to $3.5 billion in fiscal year 1998, meaning more funds for urbanized areas, rural areas, and elderly and disabled program needs. My legislation also preserves operating assistance within the formula program for all areas, unlike pending proposals to eliminate it in fiscal year 1998. 
The bill's truth in taxation provision redistributes the 4.3 cent per gallon gasoline tax which is currently going to deficit reduction in the following manner: 0.76 cents to the mass transit account of highway trust fund, 0.5 cents to a new intercity passenger rail trust fund that would serve as a dedicated source of revenue for Amtrak and is identical to the legislation introduced by Senator Roth (S. 436), and the remaining 3.04 cents to the highway trust fund. I have long argued that gas tax receipts should be used for the transportation infrastructure purposes for which the tax was enacted and that to do otherwise is comparable to the crime of fraudulent conversion, which I used to prosecute as District Attorney in Philadelphia. When people pay Federal taxes at the gas station, they are under the impression that their funds will be used to improve highways and roads and other forms of transportation infrastructure. Accordingly, it is time to redirect the 1993 gas 
tax increase to its traditional purposes. 
As I noted earlier, a new proposal for a reverse commute pilot program is also included in my bill. In order to stimulate economic development and help individuals in both urban and rural areas obtain meaningful employment and job training, the bill authorizes a new $250 million per year discretionary grant program for the Secretary of Transportation to provide funds to States, local governments, and transit systems for pilot projects providing access to suburban jobs and job training to residents of distressed urban areas with a population of over 50,000 and for pilot projects involving access to employment in rural areas as well. Funding uses could include, but are not limited to, grants to employers to purchase/lease a van or bus dedicated to shuttling employees from inner cities to suburban workplaces. Grants could also fund additional reverse commute bus routes or commuter rail operations. Such grants are intended to serve as seed money that will generate self-sustaining commute options for years to come. 954 distressed urban areas currently meet the definition contained in the bill. 
This program would not come at the expense of transit core formula and discretionary programs. The reverse commute pilot program would be a separate program and as a member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, given the importance of helping increase mobility for Americans seeking good jobs, I would urge my colleagues to fund it above and beyond the traditional formula and discretionary grant programs, for which there is already a great need for funds. 
My legislation also includes several technical program changes that will benefit transit systems of all sizes. My bill would allow the use of capital grants for maintenance of capital assets, such as buses, subways, which is currently not allowed. It would allow the smallest urban and rural transit systems complete flexibility between use of capital and operating assistance for various needs. It would also allow transit systems that sell capital assets--bought in part with Federal funds--to keep the proceeds and reinvest in new capital assets, rather than returning some small share of the proceeds to the Federal Transit Administration. This is intended to stimulate acquisitions of new equipment and vehicles by such systems. 
In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to consider supporting this authorizing legislation, which would spend out funds accumlating in the mass transit account of the highway trust fund, subject to the appropriations process and not in a manner that increases the deficit. I hope that this bill will stimulate debate in the Senate on the need to increase our commitment to mass transit and I look forward to the opportunity to work with the Banking Committee and the Appropriations Committee in the coming months. 
I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a brief summary of the bill and four letters in support of the Mass Transit Amendments Act of 1997 from Mr. William W. Millar, president of the American Public Transit Association, Mr. Armando V. Greco of the Lehigh and Northampton Transportation Authority, Mr. Paul Skoutelas, executive director of the Port Authority of Allegheny County, and Mr. Sonny Hall, international president of the Transport Workers Union of America.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am voting against the amendments offered by Senator Feinstein and Senator Daschle because I believe those amendments are so broad as to negate the purpose of the bill. 
In my judgment, as detailed below, once the child is partially out of the mother's womb, it is no longer abortion. It is infanticide. 
As a legal matter, infanticide would be justified only by analogy to self-defense to save another life--the life of the mother. That legal conclusion is based on the judgment that infanticide is not warranted for the lesser values of averting `serious adverse health consequences to the woman'--Senator Feinstein's amendment--or avoiding `grievious injury to her physical health'--Senator Daschle's amendment. 
I adhere to the fuller statement of my views set forth in my floor statement of September 26, 1996: 
This is among the most difficult of the 6,003 votes I have cast in the Senate because it involves a decision of life and death on the line between when a woman may choose abortion and what constitutes infanticide. 
In my legal judgment, the issue is not over a woman's right to chose within the constitutional context of Roe versus Wade or Planned Parenthood versus Casey. If it were, Congress could not legislate. Congress is neither competent to micromanage doctors' decisions nor constitutionally permitted to legislate where the life or health of the mother is involved in an abortion. 
In my legal judgment, the medical act or acts of commission or omission in interfering with, or not facilitating the completion of a live birth after a child is partially out of the mother's womb constitute infanticide. The line of the law is drawn, in my legal judgment, when the child is partially out of the womb of the mother. It is no longer abortion; it is infanticide. 
This vote does not affect my basic views on the pro-choice/pro-life issue. While I am personally opposed to abortion, I do not believe it can be controlled by the Government. It is a matter for women and families with guidance from ministers, priests, and rabbis. 
If partial-birth abortions are banned, women will retain the right to choose during most of pregnancy and doctors will retain the right to act to save the life of the mother.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the supplemental appropriations bill will include an amendment that I introduced to assist our Nation's dairy farmers. The amendment, which was cosponsored by Senators Santorum, Feingold, and Kohl, would require the Secretary of Agriculture to collect and disseminate statistically reliable information from milk manufacturing plants on prices received for bulk cheese and would require the Secretary to report to Congress on the rate of reporting compliance. 
Dairy prices set an all-time high in 1996, with an average price of $13.38 per hundredweight for the year. The price reached its peak in September at $15.37 per hundredweight, then dropped to $14.13 per hundredweight in October. The market experienced its largest drop in history during November, falling to $11.61 per hundredweight, which represents a 26-percent decline. During this same period, the cost of dairy production reached a record high due to a 30- to 50-percent increase in grain costs. 
On November 22, 1996, I joined with 19 of my Senate and House colleagues in writing to Agriculture Secretary Glickman, urging him to take action to help raise dairy prices. Secretary Glickman responded on January 7, 1997, by announcing several short-term actions to stabilize milk prices. While these actions did have a small positive effect in increasing dairy prices, they did not provide adequate relief to our Nation's dairy farmers. 
In order to hear the problems that dairy farmers are facing first hand, I asked Secretary Glickman to accompany me to northeastern Pennsylvania, which he did, on February 10. We met a crowd of approximately 500 to 750 angry farmers who complained about the precipitous drop in the price of milk. 
During the course of my analysis of the pricing problem, I had found that the price of milk depends on a number of factors, one of which is the price of cheese. For every 10 cents the price of cheese is raised, the price of milk would be raised by $1 per hundredweight. Then I found that the price of cheese was determined by the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, WI. At least according to a survey made by the University of Wisconsin, there was an issue as to whether the price of cheese established by the Green Bay exchange was accurate. The authors of the report used a term as tough as manipulation. Whether that is so or not, there was a real question as to whether that price was accurate. Therefore, 3 days after the hearing at Keystone College, I introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution with Senators Santorum, Feingold, Kohl, Jeffords, Leahy, Wellstone, Snowe, Collins, and Grams. The resolution, which passed by a vote of 83 to 15, stated that the Secretary of Agriculture should consider acting immediately to replace the National Cheese Exchange as a factor to be considered in setting the basic formula price for dairy. 
In my discussions with Secretary Glickman, I found he had the power to raise the price of milk unilaterally by establishing a different price of cheese. Therefore, on March 10, I wrote to Secretary Glickman and urged him to take immediate action to establish a price floor at $13.50/cwt on a temporary, emergency, interim basis until he completes action on delinking the National Cheese Exchange from the basic formula price. 
This subject was aired during the course a special hearing before the appropriations subcommittee on March 13. At that time, Secretary Glickman said that they had ascertained the identity of 118 people or entities who had cheese transactions that could establish a different price of cheese. He told me they had written to the 118 and were having problems getting responses. I 
suggested it might be faster to telephone those people. Secretary Glickman provided my staff with the list of people, and we telephoned them and found, after reaching approximately half of them, that the price of cheese was, in fact, 16 cents higher by those individuals than otherwise. On March 19, I again wrote Secretary Glickman and informed him of the results of my staff's survey, explaining that there is a $.164 difference in the price of cheese and the price from the National Cheese Exchange. This translates to a $1.64 per hundredweight addition to the price of milk. 
Moreover, on April 17, I introduced two pieces of legislation to revise our laws so that they better reflect current conditions and provide a fair market for our Nation's dedicated and hard-working farmers. The legislation goes to two points. One is to amend the Agriculture Market Transition Act to require the Secretary to use the price of feed grains and other cash expenses in the dairy industry as factors that are used to determine the basic formula for the price of milk and other milk prices regulated by the Secretary. Simply stated, the Government should use what it costs for production to establish the price of milk, so that if farmers are caught with rising prices of feed and other rising costs of production, they can have those rising costs reflected in the cost of milk. 
The second piece of legislation would require the Secretary of Agriculture to collect and disseminate statistically reliable information from milk manufacturing plants on prices received for bulk cheese and provide the Secretary with the authority to require reporting by such manufacturing plants throughout the United States on the prices of cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk. 
On Tuesday, May 6, 1997, the Department of Agriculture announced that they were replacing the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, WI with a survey of cheddar cheese manufacturers in the United States in order to determine the price of cheese for use in setting the basic formula price for dairy. 
Currently, the Department of Agriculture is relying on the voluntary compliance of cheese manufacturers to obtain information for their newly announced survey. My amendment requires the Secretary to report to Congress 150 days after the date of enactment of this bill the rate of reporting compliance by cheese manufacturers. The amendment further allows the Secretary to submit legislative recommendations to improve the rate of reporting compliance. The amendment also protects the pricing information provided to the Secretary of Agriculture. This information shall be kept confidential, and shall be used only to report general industry price figures which do not identify the information provided by any individual company. 
This amendment takes a significant step toward ensuring that our Nation's dairy farmers receive a fair price for their milk. However, we still have much work ahead of us as the Department of Agriculture and Congress work together to reform the entire milk pricing system. I will continue to work in this area to ensure that the voices of dairy farmers in Pennsylvania and throughout the Nation are heard, and to ensure that any change in Federal dairy policy is fair and provides the necessary support for our Nation's milk industry.

Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Vermont for yielding me time. I have sought recognition to support the nomination of Ms. Alexis M. Herman for Secretary of Labor, and I am glad to see we are finally moving to the confirmation process here because we need a Secretary of Labor in place to move ahead on the budget process and the appropriations process. 
I serve as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee which has jurisdiction over the Department of Labor. It has an $11 billion budget, and obviously we have not been able to hear from the Secretary of Labor so far because we have not had a Secretary of Labor. 
When Ms. Herman's status was held up early on, I met with her and had a long talk with her back in early February. I found that she had a good academic background and had a good work record. Some questions had been raised on a number of items, but it was my sense at that time that she was entitled to a hearing by the Labor Committee. 
I am delighted that Senator Jeffords and the committee have held that hearing and have reported her nomination out favorably so that we are now in a position to move ahead and to confirm her today. It is my sense that she will receive an overwhelming vote of support, perhaps even a unanimous vote. That remains to be seen. 
Apparently she will not receive a unanimous vote, from a signal from the Presiding Officer, and that is within the discretion of every Senator, to vote as he or she sees fit. I do express a concern about the nexus or the linkage of Ms. Herman to the Executive order and to other collateral matters. I have been around here long enough to understand that that is not an unusual proceeding, but it is my hope that we can decide these matters on the merits one by one. But whatever one's position might be in that connection, we at least are reaching the point where we will have a vote at 5 o'clock today on Alexis Herman to see whether or not, up or down, she is qualified, in the view of the Senate, to be the next Secretary of Labor. 
I might say that there is considerable concern about the treatment of Ms. Herman in my home State of Pennsylvania. We had a remarkable event over last Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, April 27, 28, and 29, in Philadelphia on the volunteer summit. We had four Presidents--quite an impressive showing. Somebody in the holding room said, `Mr. President' and everyone turned his head. Some who were not present turned their head, including Vice President Gore and maybe some others. 
But there was another summit, a citizen summit some blocks away in a square in Philadelphia--Philadelphia is famous for its squares--and a number of people who appeared at the Presidents' volunteer summit also appeared at the citizen summit. Mayor Rendell, who presided over the summit for Philadelphia and did an excellent job, appeared in both places as did Rev. Jesse Jackson, Congressman Fattah, and I as well. When I was at the 
citizen summit there was a lot of concern as to what was going to happen to Ms. Alexis Herman in the line of fair play, whether she was going to be treated fairly and appropriately. 
So I am glad to see our process has worked. I think Ms. Herman is qualified to be Secretary of Labor based on her academic record, her work experience, her general demeanor and general qualifications, and the appropriate committee has taken up the issues which were raised as question marks and has answered them to the satisfaction of the committee. I look forward to voting for her and look forward to her confirmation, even if it is not unanimous, but I make this prediction, that it will probably be in the 90's. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Delaware for yielding the time. 
Mr. President, on the pending issue, having studied the conditions as to what is sought here by way of preliminary action by Russia before ratification should occur by the United States, it is my strong view that we really ought not to play Gaston and Alphonse with the Russians to require them, as article C does, for Russia to deposit their ratification before the United States ratifies. 
I think that that sets up a condition which is just not reasonable. If they took the same position, as Alphonse and Gaston, no one would ever enter the door. 
With respect to the other conditions which are set forth here, all of the substantive matters would be superseded by the Chemical Weapons Convention, that the requirements set forth in this treaty would impose more obligations on Russia than are contained in these instruments. 
And under instrument A, where it is talked about, an agreement between the United States and Russia, that was never formalized into an agreement because all terms were never agreed to by the parties, so that this is not a condition which adds any measure of safety to the United States since all of the requirements imposed on Russia in these collateral arrangements would be superseded and more stringent requirements would be added by the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues on both sides for what I believe has been a very, very constructive debate in the highest tradition of the U.S. Senate. I compliment the distinguished chairman of this committee, Senator Helms, for his determination. 
And it is noted that some 28 of the 33 conditions have been agreed to. Even beyond those conditions, the President today, in writing to the distinguished majority leader, has articulated further safeguards which would be present so that in sum total we have an agreement which, while not perfect, advances the interest of arms control. 
In my capacity as the chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, I have chaired hearings on the issue of the gulf war syndrome where there is evidence that our veterans in the gulf were damaged by chemical substances, not conclusively, but that is the indication, and that had such a treaty been in effect, again, not conclusive, but a strong indication, that our troops might have been saved to some extent. 
And certainly if we intend to take a firm stand on a moral plane, the United States has to be a part of this covenant to try to reduce chemical weapons. And this treaty goes a substantial way. 
And the search and seizure provisions are adequate to protect constitutional rights, a field I have had substantial experience with as a district attorney, so that there will have to be a criminal standard of probable cause.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for the purpose of introducing legislation captioned the Minority and Women Capital Formation Act of 1997. 
I am introducing this legislation which is designed to be an economic stimulus to promote jobs and economic opportunity. Unquestionably, small minority and women-owned businesses can and must play an integral role in expanding our economy, but they cannot do so unless we are able to close the great capital gap facing these businesses. 
This bill, captioned the Minority and Women Capital Formation Act of 1997, would close this gap by providing targeted tax incentives for investors to invest equity capital in minority and women-owned small businesses, as well as venture capital funds which are dedicated to investing in minority and/or women-owned businesses. 
As long as the Internal Revenue Code continues tax incentives to promote specified business activities, then I believe this legislation is warranted. If we were to adopt a flat or modified flat tax which I favor, and have proposed, then I would be willing to forgo the tax incentive because I believe sufficient additional capital would be available for the purpose without the specific incentive. 
Small businesses in general face limited access to capital. In many instances, this lack of access amounts to a failure of many such businesses to succeed. But unlike other small businesses owned by minorities or women which have traditionally faced greater barriers in addressing private capital for startups, these businesses have been unable to achieve such funding. 
Candidly, many of these barriers are founded in racism and sexism, two subjects we do not like to talk about but two subjects which are very important and really very pervasive in our society. 
While the United States has benefited from civil rights laws, we have not yet moved ahead on the business front to provide the kinds of capitalization which we need. The `capital gap' is a phrase adopted by the U.S. Commission on Minority Business Development. In its 1990 interim report, the Commission found that the availability of capital is probably the single most important variable affecting minority business. As stated by the Commission `the problem is twofold: Lack of access to capital and credit and the need for development of alternatives to conventional financial instruments and intermediaries.' 
In its 1992 final report, the Commission said: `Without timely access to capital, you can't start or grow a business, particularly growth firms being weaned off solely Government business.' 
In 1988, the House Committee on Small Business, in its report, New Economic Realties, The Rise of Women Entrepreneurs, also noted the barriers which women face in accessing capital and the need for the Federal Government to take into account alternative development financing institutions and eliminating or circumventing such barriers. 
Mr. President, this legislation is designed to focus our attention on critical elements of a national strategy for providing access to capital and credit from minorities and women in business. The bill provides investors, and others who invest equity, capital in a small minority or women-owned businesses or venture capital for minorities, African-Americans, Hispanics, et cetera, will have tax breaks of, first, the option to elect either a tax deduction or a tax credit subject to certain annual and lifetime caps and, second, a partial capital gains exclusion of limited deferral of the remaining capital gain if it is reinvested in another minority or women-owned small business. 
Mr. Robert Johnson, president of Black Entertainment Holdings, a minority-controlled enterprise publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, testified in 1992 before the Banking Committee on the availability of capital to minority 
businesses. He stated: `The urgency of the problem requires more adventuresome kinds of policies. Policies that are designed to deal with a specific problem should be problem specific in their solution.' 
Mr. President, I note that in the 1981 to 1990 timeframe, the venture capital resources increased from approximately $5.8 billion to some $36 billion but less than one-half of 1 percent of the capital raised by the majority venture capital industry was invested in minority- or women-operated businesses, which demonstrates the need for legislation of this type and incentives. 
I believe minority and women small business development is critical to urban revitalization, job creation, and long-term economic growth. No one denies the need for urban revitalization and job creation to facilitate a sustained economic recovery. And no one should deny the role that women and minority business owners must have in this effort. During the 102d Congress as a member of the Banking Committee, I heard many firsthand accounts concerning the lack of access to capital for minority- and women-owned businesses. In some cases the cause is outright discrimination; in other instances investor or lender ignorance of the marketplace; in other fear. Whatever the cause, we are facing an emergency that requires Congress' and the President's immediate attention. 
To avoid abuse, the bill also imposes minimum holding periods of 5 years for such investments and contains recapture provisions for instances where the minority- or women-owned business or venture capital fund fails to remain qualified within the meaning of the legislation. 
Admittedly, my proposal may not be inexpensive. To address the cost issue, perhaps the bill should be limited to a tax credit, or perhaps to the capital gains benefit. In any event, I am willing to work with the estimators, my colleagues, and others to modify my bill as necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating the capital gap confronting minority- and women-owned businesses. 
Some may question the use of tax policy in the manner I am proposing. However, just as we use tax policy to foster development of housing, jobs, and research and development, so too should we utilize tax policy to foster economic empowerment of minority and women business owners who will provide jobs and generate tax revenues. 
Stated differently, this bill is really a Federal investment strategy for such businesses. The proposed tax expenditures represent seed capital to help develop greater self-sufficiency in the long term. In this regard, the bill recognizes that capital targeted to women and minority business is an essential, but often overlooked component of economic development. In my judgment, it is a very creative tool to spur business growth and job creation, particularly in distressed communities. 
Another very important feature of the bill is the provision of similar tax incentives for those who invest in venture capital funds dedicated to investing in minority- and/or women-owned businesses. Prior to 1970, the Federal Government had no dedicated sources of financing for disadvantaged businesses. In 1971, however, Congress authorized the creation of the specialized small business investment company [SSBIC] program administered by the Small Business Administration. For the last 20 years SSBIC's have been the primary source of capital for disadvantaged businesses. In the face of tremendous obstacles SSBIC's and the minority venture capital industry have made a real difference. For example, according to the National Association of Investment Companies [NAIC], over the last decade they have raised and invested nearly $1 billion in disadvantaged businesses. 
In sum, Mr. President, there remains a need to facilitate the development of minority- and women-owned small business. We cannot allow the capital gap to grow. If we are to remain a productive and competitive nation, we must eliminate it. Moreover, there is no substitute for equity capital. Federal policies should not focus exclusively on debt financing. With targeted tax incentives, such as those that I am proposing, we can cause greater investment of equity in businesses that traditionally have not been able to access it to any significant degree. I believe this capital formation bill will take us a long way toward achieving this goal. I, therefore, encourage my colleagues to join my efforts to enact this much needed legislation.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware for yielding me this time. I have sought recognition to voice my support for the pending treaty and to give my reasons. 
Long before the current debate on chemical weapons, in my college thesis, which I wrote back at the University of Pennsylvania in 1951, on United States-Soviet relations, I was convinced by Prof. Hans Morganthau's dictum that `the objectives of foreign policy must be defined in terms of the national interest and must be supported with adequate power.' 
As a U.S. Senator, I have long advocated a strong national defense and have worked to shape a comprehensive arms control agenda for the United States as one arrow in our overall defense quiver. 
Ten years ago, in 1987, in Geneva, Switzerland, I was an observer to the U.S.-USSR nuclear disarmament talks. That year I debated extensively with many of my colleagues in the Chamber the need for a broad interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, ABM. Many of those whom I opposed at that time I now side with on the current issue. I still believe that the approach for a broad interpretation to give the United States additional power, an approach advocated by President Reagan, was necessary and still remains 
necessary to provide security for our Nation. 
From my experience on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I have observed that strength is the best guarantor of peace and that prudent arms control can provide an important basis for such strength. From my work as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have seen the wisdom of President Reagan's view that verification not trust is the realistic basis for arms control. 
Verification is an important issue in this treaty. It is true that this treaty does not guarantee verification and no treaty has or can guarantee absolute certainty on verification. However, ratifying this treaty gives us far greater opportunity to verify through inspections, data collection, and establishing a norm for chemical arms reduction. 
Mr. President, I adhere to my position on the need to secure a strong defense for America. It is my belief that the Chemical Weapons Convention will complement the existing components of our foreign policy which includes our arms control treaties. As we continue to work to protect our troops abroad and our citizens at home from the threat of weapons of mass destruction, arms control is an important ingredient of a sound foreign policy. 
Critics of the Chemical Weapons Convention say the treaty provides a false sense of security. On the contrary, no Senator has ever suggested that a single treaty standing alone would adequately deter aggressor nations. The Chemical Weapons Convention is not perfect but we can build on it as a parameter for dialog. Ratification certainly does not mean that we are going to rest on our laurels. The United States did not stop moving forward with strengthening our national defense while we negotiated arms control agreements with the Russians such as the ABM Treaty, SALT I, and SALT II. In this combined approach we were successful. The nuclear threat today is dramatically lower than it was a decade or two decades ago, and arms control agreements are a critical part of that strategy. 
Similarly, we must not stop at mere ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention in our quest to destroy existing and prevent the production of new chemical and biological weapons. One area of the treaty critics often point to as being particularly detrimental to the United States is the search and seizure provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention which they claim is unconstitutional. 
This is a subject that I have worked on extensively since Mapp versus Ohio came down in 1961 imposing the burden on States not to admit evidence seized as a result of an unconstitutional search and seizure. At a time when I was an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia and later as district attorney of Philadelphia, I worked on these issues very, very extensively. Under this treaty, an international inspection team would be allowed to search a U.S. facility to determine whether or not a chemical agent is being diverted to use in noncompliance with the treaty. Similarly, that obligation, that inspection would be available for other nations. 
After careful review of the provisions of the treaty, I am personally confident that the language does not conflict with the fourth amendment of the U.S. Constitution but, rather, is in accord with that amendment. The language on search and seizure as negotiated by the administration and Members of the Senate states that in cases where the search is challenged, the U.S. Government will first obtain a criminal search warrant based upon probable cause. So that in any situation of challenge, the search will have to measure up to the tough criminal standard. In cases of routine inspection, the U.S. Government will obtain an administrative search warrant from a U.S. magistrate judge. 
Through the months preceding this debate, opponents have raised a number of issues. These include suggestions that the treaty plays into the hands of rogue nations like Libya and North Korea, that it facilitates the transfer of military chemical technology to aggressive countries and prohibits our troops from 
the use of riot control agents. 
There is now agreement on these issues among all the parties involved in negotiating the set of conditions now contained in the proposed resolution of ratification. The Chemical Weapons Convention will actually make it more difficult for rogue states to make chemical weapons. The treaty has prohibitions in place to prevent industrial espionage. Concerning riot control agents, the treaty sets sound guidelines on what agents may be used and when such agents may be used. 
As we debate the merits of the treaty and consider the outstanding amendments, I remind my colleagues of the importance of bipartisanship in foreign affairs. We have traditionally said that politics stop at the water's edge and bipartisanship in foreign affairs is of critical continuing importance. It is the role of Senators to shape a climate of bipartisan support for treaties of this magnitude. To work with the administration and our colleagues to craft an agreement that will serve the needs of the United States in both the long and short terms. Two of our noteworthy predecessors, giants in the Senate, one Republican and one Democrat, Senator Arthur Vandenberg and Senator Scoop Jackson exemplify how bipartisanship can work to the betterment of our country. Their willingness to look beyond the confines of partisan politics provides the model for us today as Republicans to support the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
And I note, Mr. President, the statement today made by our former majority leader, Senator Robert Dole, in support of the treaty. 
There is another much more recent example of why ratification of the treaty falls outside traditional partisan politics and that is the potential use of chemical agents against U.S. troops. This is an issue about which I am all too familiar. As former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and as the current chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have chaired several hearings on gulf war syndrome. I have traveled extensively throughout Pennsylvania and have heard from gulf war veterans who have been unable to explain the cause of their illnesses. And many gulf war veterans across the Nation echo similar complaints. Believe me when I say that their suffering is very real. 
Last year, this issue was addressed in great detail at a joint hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Veterans' Affairs Committee. This year a number of hearings have been held both in Washington and across Pennsylvania. And more recently, a few days ago, on April 17, Gen. Colin Powell testified before the Veterans' Affairs Committee on this important matter. While we can still not verify the cause of these illnesses, there are indicators that American troops may have been exposed to chemical agents. During the course of the hearing with General Powell, I asked him what effect if any the Chemical Weapons Convention would have had on Iraq if the United States had ratified the treaty before the gulf war and the treaty would have been in effect. 
We will never know with certainty the answer to that question. Iraq is a rogue nation, and it is difficult to imagine them as signatories. But General Powell was quick to point out that the Chemical Weapons Convention works to strengthen America's hand. 
He noted, `In the future, when we deal with rogue states or with signatory states, we will be speaking from the position not of unilateral American action, but with the support of most of the nations of the world.' 
I suggest to my colleagues that it is a matter of considerable importance in protecting American troops from the ravages of chemical warfare, which the gulf war troops may have been exposed to. 
Now, we must ask ourselves, if we had this treaty in place beforehand, would we have at least averted or minimized the effects of chemical agents on our troops? We will never know the answer to this question with certainty, but we owe it to our Nation to reach out for every possible means of reducing the threat of chemical and biological weapons. United States ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, however, may certainly constrain the further development of chemical weapons by countries like Iraq. 
Mr. President, it is obviously impossible to craft a comprehensive treaty that meets the satisfaction of all people. I respect those who have spoken against the treaty. I disagree with them, but I respect the sincerity of their views. Yet, with the appropriate assurances given about some of the finer points of the treaty on objections which have been raised by opponents, most of which have been satisfied, on issues such as constitutional rights, we as a Nation, I submit, should take the moral high ground. We should ratify the treaty, or we will be categorized with the likes of Iraq and Libya. I am not advocating that we ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention instead of pursuing other forms of protection. But it is one important point of protection. The Chemical Weapons Convention is just one more tool for the United States as we work toward a more vigilant defense for our Nation. We have come a long way in making this treaty work for the best interests of the United States of America. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote to ratify this convention.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce two pieces of legislation which will respond to a very serious problem on the falling prices of milk which have occurred in Pennsylvania, especially in northeastern Pennsylvania, and across the country. 
In introducing this legislation, I am pleased to have a chance to address this issue in the presence of the distinguished Senator from Kansas, who was the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, and is making quite an addition to the U.S. Senate. It is not inappropriate to note that Senator Roberts is from Kansas, as I am a native of Kansas. I was born in Wichita, grew up in Russell, and worked on a farm as a teenager and have some appreciation of the problems of the farmers. 
During my tenure in the U.S. Senate, I have been on the Agriculture Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. There are more people living in rural Pennsylvania than live in the rural part of any State in the Union. Mr. President, my colleague from Kansas, we have 2 1/2 million people living in rural Pennsylvania. When I last looked, which is a while ago, there were not 2 1/2 million people living in all of Kansas, let alone 2 million people--slightly reduced--when I moved into Pennsylvania. So I approach this issue with some due regard for the expert presiding over the U.S. Senate. Having discussed this issue with him before, I am not sure he agrees with me on all aspects. 
I am of the firm opinion that something needs to be done to help the milk farmers. I say that because the price of milk has fallen precipitously from almost $16 per hundredweight down to $11 per hundredweight. It has gone back up a little, but not a great deal. 
In responding to that problem, I asked the distinguished Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, also a Kansan, to accompany me to northeastern Pennsylvania, which he did, on February 10. We met a crowd of approximately 500 to 750 angry farmers who complained about the precipitous drop in the price of milk. 
During the course of my analysis of this pricing problem, I found that the price of milk depended upon a number of factors, one of which was the price of cheese. For every 10 cents the price of cheese was raised, the price of milk would be raised by $1 per hundredweight. Then I found that the price of cheese was determined by the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, WI. At least according to a survey made by the University of Wisconsin, there was an issue as to whether the price of cheese established by the Green Bay exchange was accurate or not. The authors of the report used a term as tough as manipulation. Whether that is so or not, there was a real question as to whether that price was accurate. 
Since this controversy has arisen--perhaps it brought the matter to a head, perhaps not; perhaps it would have happened anyway--it has been announced that the Green Bay exchange will close and will be replaced by a new commodity market on May 1. In any event, in my discussions with Secretary Glickman, I found he had the power to raise the price of milk unilaterally by establishing a different price of cheese. 
This subject was aired during the course of his testimony when he came before the appropriations subcommittee. It is a very good time to find a more-agreeable-than-usual Cabinet officer when a Cabinet officer comes in for the appropriations process for his Department's budget. 
During the course of that hearing, we could not explore fully the issue of the price of milk and the price of cheese, so our distinguished chairman, Senator Cochran, agreed to have a special hearing, which we had a couple of weeks later. At that time, Secretary Glickman said that they had ascertained the identity of 118 people or entities who had cheese transactions that could establish a different price of cheese. He told me they had written 
to the 118 and were having problems getting responses. I suggested it might be faster to telephone those people. 
Secretary Glickman provided my staff and me with the list of people, and we telephoned them and found, after reaching approximately half of them, that the price of cheese was, in fact, 16 cents higher by those individuals than otherwise. 
I have been pressing Secretary Glickman since. If he has C-SPAN2, or if he knows someone who has C-SPAN2 or if he talks to someone who has C-SPAN2, my staff has been exhorting his staff daily to act on it, and I am going to send him a fax letter before the day is up to try to get a determination on this issue, because I am on my way to northeastern Pennsylvania again next Monday on a routine trip to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area. The Presiding Officer knows what that is like. There will be people who want answers to questions, and I shall answer with due diligence, which I think I have. I hope the Secretary of Agriculture will note this different price of cheese and act accordingly to raise the price of milk. 
The legislation which I am introducing today goes to two points. One is to amend the Agriculture Market Transition Act to require the Secretary to use the price of feed grains and other cash expenses in the dairy industry as factors that are used to determine the basic formula for the price of milk and other milk prices regulated by the Secretary. 
Simply stated, the Government should use what it costs for production to establish the price of milk, so that if the farmers are caught with rising prices of feed and other rising costs of production, they can have those rising costs reflected in the cost of milk. 
The second piece of legislation would require the Secretary of Agriculture to collect and disseminate statistically reliable information from milk manufacturing plants on prices received for bulk cheese and provide the Secretary with the authority to require reporting by such manufacturing plants throughout the United States on the prices for cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk. 
Frankly, I am reluctant to impose this obligation anywhere, but I think it is a fair request to make since the Secretary told the Subcommittee on Agriculture of the Appropriations Committee that the Secretary could not get this information on a voluntary basis. People would not comply. My staff found that corroborated when we telephoned the individuals who had these transactions. Burdensome as it is, I think it is fair to give the Secretary the authority to require this reporting. 
Mr. President, I am authorized to say that the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, wishes to cosponsor the piece of legislation requiring the information to be collected.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce the Flat Tax Act of 1997. This is legislation modeled after the legislation which I introduced in the 104th Congress, in March 1995, which was the first Senate introduction of flat tax legislation. 
This bill is modeled after proposals by two distinguished professors of law from Stanford University, Professor Hall and Professor Rabushka. This bill would eliminate all deductions, like the Hall-Rabushka plan, with the modification in my legislation to allow deductions for interest on home interest mortgages up to borrowings of $100,000 and contributions to charity up to $2,500. 
The Hall-Rabushka plan would provide for a flat tax rate of 19 percent to be revenue neutral. My proposal raises that rate by 1 percent to 20 percent to allow for the deductions for home interest mortgages, which would cost $35 billion a year, and the charitable deduction, which would cost $13 billion a year. 
Mr. President, the advantages of the flat tax are very, very substantial. 
First, in the interest of simplicity, a tax return could be filled out on a simple postcard. And this is a tax return which I hold in my hand which could take 15 minutes to fill out. It requires simply that the taxpayer list the gross revenue, list his taxable income, carry forward the deductions for his family, any deductions on interest, any deduction on a home mortgage, the balance of the taxable items, multiplied by 20 percent. 
Taxpayers in the United States today, Mr. President, spend some 5,400,000 hours at a cost of some $600 billion a year. The flat tax taxes income only once and thereby eliminates the tax on capital gains. It eliminates the tax on estates, eliminates the tax on dividends, all of which have already been taxed once. 
The flat tax is frequently challenged as being regressive, but the fact of the matter is that a taxpayer of a family of four would pay no taxes on the first $27,500 in income; and as it graduates up the scale, a taxpayer earning $35,000 would pay $1,219 less in tax than is paid under the current plan. 
It is frequently thought that the flat tax would be regressive and place a higher tax burden on lower income families, but that simply is not true. And the reason that we can have a win-win situation is because the flat tax provides for savings on compliance in the range of some $600 billion a year. 
This is a very progrowth proposition. And the economists have projected that over a 7-year period the gross national product could be increased by some $2 trillion. That is over $7,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. 
The great advantages of simplicity would especially be appreciated, Mr. President, on this particular day, April 16, because yesterday was the final day for filing the tax returns without any extension. And I have chosen the first day of the new tax period for symbolic reasons--April 16--as a day to reintroduce the flat tax to try to give us some momentum because it is my firm view that if Americans really understood the import of the flat tax, its simplicity, its growth, and its savings, that it would be widely heralded. 
Mr. President as I stated, in the 104th Congress, I was the first Senator to introduce flat tax legislation and the first Member of Congress to set forth a deficit-neutral plan for dramatically reforming our Nation's Tax Code and replacing it with a flatter, fairer plan designed to stimulate economic growth. My flat tax legislation was also the first plan to retain limited deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions. 
I testified with House Majority Leader Richard Armey before the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees, as well as the Joint Economic Committee and the House Small Business Committee on the tremendous benefits of flat tax reform. As I traveled around the country and held open-house town meetings across Pennsylvania and other States, the public support for fundamental tax reform was overwhelming. I would point out in those speeches that I never leave home without two key documents: My copy of the Constitution and my copy of my 10-line-flat-tax postcard. I soon realized that I needed more than just one copy of my flat-tax postcard--many people wanted their own postcard so that they could see what life in a flat tax world would be like, where tax returns only take 15 minutes to fill out and individual taxpayers are no longer burdened with double taxation on their dividends, interest capital gains and estates. 
Support for the flat tax is growing as more and more Americans embrace the simplicity, fairness, and growth potential of flat tax reform. An April 17, 1995, edition of Newsweek cited a poll showing that 61 percent of Americans favor a flat tax over the current Tax Code. Significantly, a majority of the respondents who favor the flat tax preferred my plan for a flat tax with limited deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions. Well before he entered the Republican Presidential primary, publisher Steve Forbes opined in a March 27, 1995, Forbes editorial about the tremendous appeal and potency of my flat tax plan. 
Congress was not immune to public demand for reform. Jack Kemp was appointed to head up the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform and the commission soon came out with its report recognizing the value of a fairer, flatter Tax Code. Mr. Forbes soon introduced a flat tax plan of his own, and my fellow candidates in the Republican Presidential primary began to embrace similar versions of either a flat tax or a consumption-based tax system. 
Unfortunately, the politics of the Presidential campaign denied the flat tax a fair hearing and momentum stalled. On October 27, 1995, I introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling on my colleagues to expedite congressional adoption of a flat tax. The resolution, which was introduced as an amendment to pending legislation, was not adopted. 
In this new period of opportunity as we commence the 105th session of Congress, I am optimistic that public support for flat tax reform will enable us to move forward and adopt this critically important and necessary legislation. That is why I am again introducing my Flat Tax Act of 1997, with some slight modifications to reflect inflation-adjusted increases in the personal allowances and dependent allowances. 
My flat tax legislation will fundamentally revise the present Tax Code, with its myriad rates, deductions, and instructions. Instead, this legislation would institute a simple, flat 20 percent tax rate for all individuals and businesses. It will allow all taxpayers to file their April 15 tax returns on a simple 10-line postcard. This proposal is not cast in stone, but is intended to move the debate forward by focusing attention on three key principles which are critical to an effective and equitable taxation system: simplicity, fairness, and economic growth. 
Over the years and prior to my legislative efforts on behalf of flat tax reform, I have devoted considerable time and attention to analyzing our Nation's Tax Code and the policies which underlie it. I began this study of the complexities of the Tax Code 40 years ago as a law student at Yale University. I included some tax law as part of my practice in my early years as an attorney in Philadelphia. In the spring of 1962, I published a law review article in the Villanova Law Review, `Pension and Profit Sharing Plans: Coverage and Operation for Closely Held Corporations and Professional Associations,' 7 Villanova L. Rev. 335, which in part focused on the inequity in making tax-exempt retirement benefits available to some kinds of businesses but not others. It was apparent then, as it is now, that the very complexities of the Internal Revenue Code could be used to give unfair advantage to some; and made the already unpleasant obligation of paying taxes a real nightmare for many Americans. 
Well before I introduced my flat tax bill early in the 104th Congress, I had discussions with Congressman Richard Armey, now the House majority leader, about his flat tax proposal. Since then, and both before and after introducing my original flat tax bill, my staff and I have studied the flat tax at some length, and have engaged in a host of discussions with economists and tax experts, including the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, to evaluate the economic impact and viability of a flat tax. 
Based on those discussions, and on the revenue estimates supplied to us, I have concluded that a simple flat tax at a rate of 20 percent on all business and personal income can be enacted without reducing Federal revenues. 
The flat tax will help reduce the size of government and allow ordinary citizens to have more influence over how their money is spent because they will spend it--not the government. With a simple 20 percent flat tax rate in effect, the average person can easily see the impact of any additional Federal spending proposal on his or her own paycheck. By creating strong incentives for savings and investment, the flat tax will have the beneficial result of making available larger pools of capital for expansion of the private sector of the economy--rather than more tax money for big government. This will mean more jobs and, just as important, more higher paying jobs. 
As a matter of Federal tax policy, there has been considerable controversy over whether tax breaks should be used to stimulate particular kinds of economic activity, or whether tax policy should be neutral, leaving people to do what they consider best from a purely economic point of view. Our current Tax Code attempts to use tax policy to direct economic activity, but experience under that Code has demonstrated that so-called tax breaks are inevitably used as the basis for tax shelters which have no real relation to solid economic purposes, or to the activities which the tax laws were meant to promote. Even when the Government responds to particular tax shelters with new and often complex revisions of the regulations, clever tax experts are able to stay one or two steps ahead of the IRS bureaucrats by changing the structure of their business transactions and then claiming some legal distinctions between the taxpayer's new approach and 
the revised IRS regulations and precedents. 
Under the massive complexity of the current IRS Code, the battle between $500-an-hour tax lawyers and IRS bureaucrats to open and close loopholes is a battle the Government can never win. Under the flat tax bill I offer today, there are no loopholes, and tax avoidance through clever manipulations will become a thing of the past. 
The basic model for this legislation comes from a plan created by Profs. Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institute at Stanford University. Their plan envisioned a flat tax with no deductions whatever. After considerable reflection, I decided to include limited deductions for home mortgage interest on up to $100,000 in borrowing and charitable contributions up to $2,500 in the legislation. While these modifications undercut the pure principle of the flat tax, by continuing the use of tax policy to promote home buying and charitable contributions, I believe that those two deductions are so deeply ingrained in the financial planning of American families that they should be retained as a matter of fairness and public policy--and also political practicality. With those two deductions maintained, passage of a modified flat tax will be difficult; but without them, probably impossible. 
In my judgment, an indispensable prerequisite to enactment of a modified flat tax is revenue neutrality. Professor Hall advised that the revenue neutrality of the Hall-Rabushka proposal, which uses a 19-percent rate, is based on a well documented model founded on reliable governmental statistics. My legislation raises that rate from 19- to 20-percent to accommodate retaining limited home mortgage interest and charitable deductions. A preliminary estimate last Congress by the Committee on Joint Taxation places the annual cost of the home interest deduction at $35 billion, and the cost of the charitable deduction at $13 billion. While the revenue calculation is complicated because the Hall-Rabushka proposal encompasses significant revisions to business taxes as well as personal income taxes, there is a sound basis for concluding that the 1-percent increase in rate would pay for the two deductions. Revenue estimates for Tax Code revisions are difficult to obtain and are, at best, judgment calls based on projections from fact situations with myriad assumed variables. It is possible that some modification may be needed at a later date to guarantee revenue neutrality. 
This legislation offered today is quite similar to the bill introduced in the House by Congressman Armey and in the Senate late in 1995 by Senator Richard Shelby, which were both in turn modeled after the Hall-Rabushka proposal. The flat tax offers great potential for enormous economic growth, in keeping with principles articulated so well by Jack Kemp. This proposal taxes business revenues fully at their source, so that there is no personal taxation on interest, dividends, capital gains, gifts, or estates. Restructured in this way, the Tax Code can become a powerful incentive for savings and investment--which translates into economic growth and expansion, more and better jobs, and a rising standard of living for all Americans. 
In the 104th Congress, we took some important steps toward reducing the size and cost of Government, and this work is ongoing and vitally important. But the work of downsizing Government is only one side of the coin; what we must do at the same time, and with as much energy and care, is to grow the private sector. As we reform the welfare programs and Government bureaucracies of past administrations, we must replace those programs with a prosperity that extends to all segments of American society through private investment and job creation--which can have the additional benefit of producing even lower taxes for Americans as 
economic expansion adds to Federal revenues. Just as Americans need a Tax Code that is fair and simple, they also are entitled to tax laws designed to foster rather than retard economic growth. The bill I offer today embodies those principles. 
My plan, like the Armey-Shelby proposal, is based on the Hall-Rabushka analysis. But my flat tax differs from the Armey-Shelby plan in four key respects: First, my bill contains a 20-percent flat tax rate. Second, this bill would retain modified deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions--which will require a 1-percent higher tax rate than otherwise. Third, my bill would maintain the automatic withholding of taxes from an individual's paycheck. Last, my bill is designed to be revenue neutral, and thus will not undermine our vital efforts to balance the Nation's budget. The estimate of revenue neutrality is based on the Hall-Rabushka analysis together with preliminary projections supplied by the Joint Committee on Taxation on the modifications proposed in this bill. 
The key advantages of this flat tax plan are threefold: First, it will dramatically simplify the payment of taxes. Second, it will remove much of the IRS regulatory morass now imposed on individual and corporate taxpayers, and allow those taxpayers to devote more of their energies to productive pursuits. Third, since it is a plan which rewards savings and investment, the flat tax will spur economic growth in all sectors of the economy as more money flows into investments and savings accounts, and as interest rates drop. By contrast, there will be a contraction of the IRS if this proposal is enacted. 
Under this tax plan, individuals would be taxed at a flat rate of 20 percent on all income they earn from wages, pensions, and salaries. Individuals would not be taxed on any capital gains, interest on savings, or dividends--since those items will have already been taxed as part of the flat tax on business revenue. The flat tax will also eliminate all but two of the deductions and exemptions currently contained within the Tax Code. Instead, taxpayers will be entitled to personal allowances for themselves and their children. These personal allowances have been adjusted upward to reflect inflation increases for 1995 and 1996. Thus, the new personal allowances are: $10,000 for a single taxpayer; $15,000 for a single head of household; $17,500 for a married couple filing jointly; and $5,000 per child or dependent. These personal allowances would be adjusted annually for inflation commencing in 1997. 
In order to ensure that this flat tax does not unfairly impact low-income families, the personal allowances contained in my proposal are much higher than the standard deduction and personal exemptions allowed under the current Tax Code. For example, in 1996, the standard deduction is $4,000 for a single taxpayer, $5,900 for a head of household, and $6,700 for a married couple filing jointly, while the personal exemption for individuals and dependents is $2,550. Thus, under the current Tax Code, a family of four which does not itemize deductions would pay tax on all income over $16,900--personal exemptions of $10,400 and a standard deduction of $6,700. By contrast, under my flat tax bill, that same family would receive a personal exemption of $27,500, and would pay tax only on income over that amount. 
My legislation retains the provisions for the deductibility of charitable contributions up to a limit of $2,500 and home mortgage interest on up to $100,000 of borrowing. Retention of these key deductions will, I believe, enhance the political salability of this legislation and allow the debate on the flat tax to move forward. If a decision is made to eliminate these deductions, the revenue saved could be used to reduce the overall flat tax rate below 20 percent. 
With respect to businesses, the flat tax would also be a flat rate of 20 percent. My legislation would eliminate the intricate scheme of complicated depreciation schedules, deductions, credits, and other complexities that go into business taxation in favor of a much-simplified system that taxes all business revenue less only wages, direct expenses, and purchases--a system with much less potential for fraud, `creative accounting,' and tax avoidance. 
Businesses would be allowed to expense 100 percent of the cost of capital formation, including purchases of capital equipment, structures, and land, and to do so in the year in which the investments are made. The business tax would apply to all money not reinvested in the company in the form of employment or capital formation--thus fully taxing revenue at the business level and making it inappropriate to retax the same moneys when passed on to investors as dividends or capital gains. 
Let me now turn to a more specific discussion of the advantages of the flat tax legislation I am reintroducing today.  
SIMPLICITY 
The first major advantage to this flat tax is simplicity. According to the Tax Foundation, Americans spend approximately 5.3 billion hours each year filling out tax forms. Much of this time is spent burrowing through IRS laws and regulations which fill 12,000 pages and which, according to the Tax Foundation, have grown from 744,000 words in 1955 to 5.6 million words in 1994. The Internal Revenue Code annotations alone fill 21 volumes of mind-numbing detail and minutiae. 
Whenever the Government gets involved in any aspect of our lives, it can convert the most simple goal or task into a tangled array of complexity, frustration, and inefficiency. By way of example, most Americans have become familiar with the absurdities of the Government's military procurement programs. If these programs have taught us anything, it is how a simple purchase order for a hammer or a toilet seat can mushroom into thousands of words of regulations and restrictions when the Government gets involved. The Internal Revenue Service is certainly no exception. Indeed, it has become a distressingly common experience for taxpayers to receive computerized printouts claiming that additional taxes are due, which require repeated exchanges of correspondence or personal visits before it is determined, as it so often is, that the taxpayer was right in the first place. 
The plan offered today would eliminate these kinds of frustrations for millions of taxpayers. This flat tax would enable us to scrap the great majority of the IRS rules, regulations, instructions, and delete literally millions of words from the Internal Revenue Code. Instead of tens of millions of hours of nonproductive time spent in compliance with--or avoidance of--the Tax Code, taxpayers would spend only the small amount of time necessary to fill out a postcard-sized form. Both business and individual taxpayers would thus find valuable hours freed up to engage in productive business activity, or for more time with their families, instead of poring over tax tables, schedules, and regulations. 
The flat tax I have proposed can be calculated just by filling out a small postcard which would require a taxpayer only to answer a few easy questions. The postcard would look like this:  
FORM 1 INDIVIDUAL WAGE TAX 1997 
Your first name and initial (if joint return, also give spouse's name and initial). 
Your social security number. 
Home address (number and street including apartment number or rural route). 
Spouse's social security number. 
City, town, or post office, state, and ZIP code. 
1. Wages, salary, pension and retirement benefits. 
2. Personal allowance (enter only one): 
 --$17,500 for married filing jointly; 
 --$10,000 for single; 
 --$15,000 for single head of household. 
3. Number of dependents, not including spouse, multiplied by $5,000. 
4. Mortgage interest on debt up to $100,000 for owner-occupied home. 
5. Cash or equivalent charitable contributions (up to $2,500). 
6. Total allowances and deductions (lines 2, 3, 4 and 5). 
7. Taxable compensation (line 1 less line 6, if positive; otherwise zero). 
8. Tax (20% of line 7). 
9. Tax withheld by employer. 
10. Tax or refund due (difference between lines 8 and 9). 
Filing a tax return would become a manageable chore, not a seemingly endless nightmare, for most taxpayers.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to acknowledge John `Jack' Pidgeon's 40th anniversary as headmaster of the Kiski School in Saltsburg, PA. John is well known to many Pennsylvanians for his excellent career in education and also is the proud husband of Pennsylvania's State treasurer, Barbara Hafer. 
Forty years ago, John Pidgeon left a position at the Deerfield Academy to assume the position of headmaster of the Kiski School. In 1957, he became the youngest headmaster in the United States. Today, he is the longest serving headmaster in the country. In this capacity, he has worked to stabilize the school's finances, develop the campus, and build upon its outstanding academic reputation. 
When John first arrived at the Kiski School, the institution's infrastructure was suffering and its deficit was rising. Under his direction, the school raised funds for a campus face lift, built a strong financial foundation, and stabilized enrollment. Throughout his career, he has emphasized the value of courtesy, ethics, discipline, high moral standards, and quality of education. By establishing a philosophy that combined these values in the school's education program, he has prepared Kiski boys to meet the challenges and opportunities they will face in the future.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution which would recognize the service and dedication of America's former prisoners of war [POW's]. The resolution would designate April 9, 1997, and April 9, 1998, as National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. April 9 is the anniversary of the fall of Bataan in 1942. On that day more Americans became POW's than any other day in our history. 
Every American who wears the uniform of our country makes a unique commitment of service and duty to our country and to our fellow citizens. Perhaps no American veterans have been called upon to honor their commitment to our country under circumstances more difficult than those endured by our former POW's. For many, their experience was one of malnutrition, torture, and nonexistent medical care, combined with the burden of watching comrades die under terrible conditions. 
Even under the best possible conditions, the POW experience places American service members in the position of being dependent upon our Nation's enemies for every scrap of food, every bandage, every human need. In such circumstances, the reward for treason, or even cooperation, is high. The penalty for resistance and loyalty is immediate, frequently painful and sometimes fatal. This resolution recognizes the sacrifice and loyalty of the POW's who maintained their commitment of service to our country. In so doing, it helps fulfill the duty we have to former POW's, derived from their faithful discharge of duty to our nation. 
Mr. President, this resolution commemorates the service of former POW's who sustained their commitment to our country under circumstances that few of us can imagine, and none would willingly endure. I ask this body to honor the memory of those who have already died and express our gratitude to those still alive.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for yielding me time. 
I have sought recognition to voice my very strong support for the nomination of Merrick Garland for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Mr. President, a great deal has been said today on this floor which is of great importance but not really tremendously related to Merrick Garland's nomination. I hope we have a chance to analyze the entire process of confirmation of judges and the respective roles of the President and the Senate, because the President has the nominating authority and the Senate has the constitutional authority for confirmation. There are a great many things that ought to be done on both sides to expedite the nomination and confirmation of judges. 
In my own State, Pennsylvania has quite a number of vacancies now, and I have been in discussions with the President's representatives at the White House about trying to get these nominations filled. There is something to be said on many sides of this issue. The matter confronting the Senate now is, what are we going to do with Merrick Garland? His record is extraordinary. I have been on the Judiciary Committee going into my 17th year and I do not believe I have seen a nominee with the qualifications that this man has. 
He graduated from Harvard College, summa cum laude, was Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated from Harvard Law School, magna cum laude. He was on the Harvard Law Review and was the Articles Editor there. He has an extraordinary record of publications, on the issue of Antitrust, in the Yale Law Journal. And I might say, Mr. President, that this nominee exhibited perhaps his best judgment in associating himself with Yale Law School on the article, then going on into FTC investigations, the controversial veto issue, professional responsibility and commercial speech. It is really an extraordinary, extraordinary record. This man, at the age of 45, coming into the court of appeals, may well be a distinguished prospect for the Supreme Court of the United States. 
Beyond his record in school and his writings, he was law clerk to a very distinguished circuit judge, Judge Harry Jay Friendly, and he served as law clerk to Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, Jr., and was a partner of distinguished law firms, and worked as a prosecuting attorney. He now serves as Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the United States in the U.S. Department of Justice, in the Criminal Law Division, where I have had occasion to work with him on a professional basis. He just is an extraordinary prospect for the court of appeals. 
He has not been treated very gently in the confirmation process, having been nominated in September 1995. He passed through the Judiciary Committee in the 104th Congress and was kept off the agenda by a single hold. That is when a Senator voices an objection without stating a reason, or perhaps multiple holds, but I know a single hold stood in his way. 
I compliment the majority leader, Senator Lott, for bringing his nomination to the floor at this time so that he may be acted upon, yes or no. He really is extraordinary, and I think he has a remarkable career ahead. I am delighted to offer my voice of strong support for his confirmation. 
I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Utah. I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Vermont for making that comment. I had presided over Merrick Garland's confirmation proceedings in the 104th Congress. It was hard to find a Senator when I came in that afternoon. I found out Merrick Garland was there and five other people. It was an interesting afternoon. We had a great many responsibilities. 
I went to law school not too long ago and I know what it is like to be on the law review. They call it the Law Journal at Yale. It is remarkable to have the kind of record that Merrick Garland has. Those writings are just extraordinary. It takes long hours and extraordinary study to turn one of those articles out, 
and there is a wide array of issues that he has written on. He could be making a lot of money. He is currently in public service and he is prepared to go to the court of appeals at the age of 45. We need judges in America with real intellectual abilities. We need judges like Holmes and Brandeis and Cardozo on the courts of the United States. We need them on the Supreme Court of the United States. This is a real prospect. We ought to get him up and out. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. I understand the majority leader is on his way to the floor. Apparently there is a unanimous-consent request. As soon as he gets here, I will be glad to yield to him at that time. 
Mr. President, I support this constitutional amendment for campaign finance reform and for overturning Buckley versus Valeo because I am convinced that only if we have such a constitutional amendment will we be able to have meaningful campaign finance reform. And that is urgently needed. 
Those who oppose the amendment do so on a claim that there would be an invasion of inviolate first amendment protections. I suggest those arguments are not well founded as a matter of constitutional law or constitutional history. 
The first amendment of the U.S. Constitution has been limited where there are important reasons for doing so. Perhaps the most famous decision is by Oliver Wendell Holmes on what is called the `clear and present danger' which would warrant limiting freedom of speech. The famous example was given of crying `fire' in a crowded theater. 
And, Mr. President, I suggest that there is a clear and present danger today to America's political system if we do not have effective campaign finance reform. 
The `fighting words' exception to freedom of speech is well recognized in a distinguished opinion by Justice Murphy. If someone says to another a racial slur or religious slur, that person may punch the speaker in the nose and not be charged with assault and battery, so that freedom of speech is limited by fighting words. 
You have the examples of obscenity and moral standards, especially with children. There are limits as to what may be spoken or what may be put into printed context on obscenity. 
It is my view, and really a prevailing view in America today, that there is an urgent necessity for campaign finance reform. It simply cannot be done if you have the Supreme Court decisions standing in the way, because they say that an individual may spend as much of his or her money as he or she may choose as a matter of freedom of speech but others cannot do so. Others are limited to $1,000. 
I have cited a rather forceful example from my point of view of my own personal experience running in the primary in 1976 for the U.S. Senate when the 1974 law was in effect limiting expenditures for a candidate in the primary with the population size of Pennsylvania to $35,000. And my opponent in that race--who later was one of my very best friends and closest colleagues in the U.S. Senate, Senator John Heinz--we were opposing each other in that Senate primary. 
The Supreme Court of the United States held that an individual could spend millions, and Senator Heinz did that, spent more than $3 million in that primary and general election. But at the same time, the Supreme Court upheld the limitation of $1,000 on what my brother could spend. Where was Morton Specter's freedom of speech if he was limited by the campaign finance law to $1,000? 
What sense does it make to say that a candidate has more freedom of speech than some other contributor? But that is what the Buckley versus Valeo decision did. 
Then you have this rule or exception on campaign expenditures which are independent. That has become a practical impossibility to define what is an independent expenditure. 
You have the 1996 Presidential election. You have an enormous amount of soft money raised on both sides by Republicans as well as Democrats, but the Democrats did it with more finesse, more direction, and more success, when President Clinton used millions of dollars in soft money for advertising in 1995, which so set the stage to make it impossible or at least virtually impossible to regain that ground. In this situation you had President Clinton personally editing the commercials which went over. 
Yet, they were supposed to be somehow immune from the Federal election laws, notwithstanding the fact that when a candidate runs for President there is a pledge that there will be no funds used on expenditures in addition to what the Federal Government is providing. 
We have myriad rules on soft money. We have rules that are really impossible to apply on what is issue advocacy, where you can spend money, as opposed to advocacy for a candidate. Those commercials not only go right to the line, they really cross the line, with no enforcement possible, with a commercial saying everything but `vote for candidate John Doe.' 
The realism is that in the absence of an opportunity for Congress to legislate in this field, without this constitutional inhibition, campaign finance reform may not be achieved. 
Then you had the recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1996 on the Colorado legal party where there are four opinions written and not one of the opinions commands the consent or concurrence of five Justices. So when you finish reading that opinion, it is absolutely impossible to say what the law is on the important campaign issues taken up in that case. The Supreme Court Justices are frequent in their criticism of what we pass in the Congress where they cannot find a clear-cut statement on our legislation and then they look to legislative intent. Some of the Justices say they cannot find legislative intent or they do not recognize legislative intent. 
Our statutes are a model of clarity, and the worst of the statutes ever passed by the Congress of the United States is a model of clarity compared to what you had in the Supreme Court decision in the Colorado case, where you cannot possibly figure out what the law is, because among four opinions no five Justices have agreed on any set rationale to give guidance as to what the law should be. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, since the majority leader has arrived, it is my view, after studying the Constitution for more than 40 years, that the decision of Buckley versus Valeo simply is not good constitutional law to equate speech with campaign spending. It impedes, obstructs, and prevents Congress from legislating in this important field. That is why I urge this amendment be adopted. 
I have no doubt, Mr. President, about the outcome of today's vote. I say as a matter for the future we ought to build a record, one day, so that we will overturn Buckley v. Valeo, and then have some sensible legislation in this very critical area. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had come to the Senate Chamber to speak on the resolution on the independent counsel but on my way I noted the morning press have comments to make in advance of that. However, before my distinguished colleague from Connecticut leaves, I agree with him on some of what he has said. I will not go into the parts where I disagree with him. It would take too long. 
When he talks about the Federal Election Commission, strengthening the Federal Election Commission, funding adequately the Federal Election Commission, I think that is something that ought to be done. The Federal Election Commission needs to be able to pursue alleged election violations. They have very broad powers and we have heard very little from them. It may be that their investigations are yet incomplete. But it also may be that if they had sufficient investigative resources they might have done more already. 
We do not need to await the results of the Governmental Affairs Committee, on which I serve. We are just getting started with the funding authorization. Nor do we need to await the results of the public integrity section, the FBI or their investigations, nor do we need to wait to see what will happen with the independent counsel, as I will address in a few moments. 
We have a Federal Election Commission, and were they strong enough they could have acted already on these very, very important matters.

Mr. SPECTER. It is a matter of prioritizing. We have a hemorrhaging system. There is blood on the floor and there is blood coming out of the patient. I would think as a matter of priority they would at least address that and try to give some first aid. I do not know what they have found, and I do not know the specifics upon what injunctive relief they might seek, but they have attorneys that might look at the current system and act now. 
They are a constituted agency and they have conducted criminal investigations. They could work this in the civil field. It comes as a surprise to me when a Senator of your standing, Senator Dodd, makes that suggestion to them, and months go by without any response to it.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I came to address the subject of independent counsel and, en route, I picked up the morning newspapers. I am horrified by what has occurred in Jordan. The headline is blaring: `Jordan Soldier Kills Seven Israeli Schoolgirls.' 
The lead report from the Philadelphia Inquirer is: 
A group of Israeli schoolgirls was standing on Peace Island yesterday, overlooking the Jordan River and fields of wild yellow flowers, when a Jordanian soldier opened fire with an assault rifle, killing seven students. Six other pupils were wounded, as girls dove into the bushes and screamed for help. 
After seizing a comrade's M-16 rifle, the soldier fired from an observation tower, then descended and chased the screaming junior high school girls down a hill firing wildly. 
According to a report in the Washington Post, Rosa Himi, a teacher of the Orthodox Jewish school in Beit Shemesh, near Jerusalem, that the 51 students attended said: 
At the beginning, Jordanian soldiers didn't overpower him and didn't do anything. . .. They even pushed one of our teachers and wouldn't let him near the injured girls to care for them. It is only when he failed to put his second [ammunition] clip in the gun that the other soldiers took him. 
It is really a very shocking turn of events, Mr. President, in circumstances where one would almost think we were beyond the point of being shocked. There is a sequence of violence that has occurred--candidly, with both sides--like the event at the tomb of Abraham some time ago, where an Israeli fired on people. I suggest that it really requires a new level of sober examination as to what is going on in the Mideast and what the so-called `leaders' in the Mideast are doing which is really inflammatory. King Hussein had sent a letter to Prime Minister Netanyahu, saying that Prime Minister Netanyahu was engaged in the deliberate humiliation of Arabs and was accumulating tragic accidents leading to bloodshed and disaster brought about by fear and despair. There have already been suggestions from a number of quarters that King Hussein was inciting a riot by those inflammatory statements. 
I think it is inappropriate to join that chorus. But I do think that King Hussein and others have to tone down the rhetoric and have to be a lot more thoughtful than they have been. I know King Hussein--not well, but I have had occasion to talk to him when he has been in Washington. I talked to him when I have visited in Jordan. I do believe that King Hussein is sincere in his efforts for peace. 
The morning press comments about the Crown Prince of Jordan coming to the scene and that he was stricken with remorse and grief, as King Hussein's statements issued after this tragedy reflected his own view. But what is happening in the Mideast requires that there be more restraint by people like King Hussein. That, of course, is easy to say after the fact. But I think it has to be said. 
We are now seeing a conference in Gaza, sponsored by the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Chairman Arafat, where the United States has agreed to participate and Israel has been excluded. I joined a large group of Senators in writing to President Clinton yesterday, urging the President to change his policy on that. In my judgment, and in the judgment of many of my colleagues far beyond this Chamber, there is a strong view that there ought not to be a conference where Israel is excluded. There will be no peace process in the Mideast to which Israel is not a party. For Chairman Arafat to convene a group of representatives of nations of the world to meet and talk about the peace process, which will inevitably involve charges of impropriety by Israel because they appear in the international media daily, without having Israel as a party to that process and allowing Israel an opportunity to reply, it seems to me to be absolutely inexcusable. 
We ought not to be saying that parties in interest, like the Palestinians and the PLO, ought to be gathering international 
strength to attack, impugn, or otherwise move against a party to the peace process. If there is going to be peace, it is going to have to be worked out between the Palestinians and the Israelis. To have this kind of conference compounds the tragedy in Jordan, and I do hope, yet, that the administration will rethink what it has undertaken to do. 
I know that a good many of these issues come before the Congress, come before the Senate, come before the Appropriations Committee, on which I serve, and before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, where we are asked to appropriate money. We are now about to be asked to appropriate additional funds. The Congress does not have the power that the President has to conduct foreign affairs, although we do have considerable power in the appropriations process, the power of the purse. We are looking at requests for aid to Jordan. In fiscal year 1997, we gave Jordan $67.1 million. In fiscal year 1998, the President has made a request for $74.2 million, an increase of $7.1 million. Jordan is also asking for an additional $250 million in funding per year over the next 5 years. I have already been lobbied, individually, about supporting that increase in funding for Jordan. 
The initial reaction that I had goes back to Jordan's conduct during the gulf war, where I and many others in this body, many other Americans, and many others around the world were very unhappy--to use a very mild term--with what Jordan did in aiding and abetting Iraq and Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein. They were complicitous in helping Iraq in that war, where American lives were laid on the line and American lives were lost.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I see my colleague, Senator Dorgan, on the floor waiting to speak. So I shall not take too long in commenting on the resolution calling for independent counsel, Senate Joint Resolution 22. But I came here to speak on this subject, and I think the time is past for independent counsel. 
Independent counsel should be appointed where there is credible evidence that there had been criminal violations. You don't have to prove the case. Credible evidence is really a statement of prima facie which takes the case from the grand jury and on a fair evaluation as to what has occurred and what has been made public. It is my legal judgment, having some experience in the field, having been district attorney for Philadelphia for 8 years, and having served on the Judiciary Committee for many years, that we have long since passed that point. 
It is not a partisan issue. It is not just Republican Senators who are saying that. The same call has come on the other side of the aisle from Democrats. You have ranking officials who have been involved in fundraising in religious institutions which raise violations of Federal law in a fairly clear-cut manner. You have, again, ranking officials who have engaged in campaign practices. Dick Morris was cited by the President himself as having identified the commercials. We know the President is bound not to accept additional money when there is Federal financing, which there was. And millions of dollars were raised, again, on both sides. Those moneys were used to further the President's campaign in 1995. 
There is an issue about advocacy as opposed to the candidates themselves. But that line, I think, has been crossed. Certainly, there is credible evidence which warrants an investigation. 
The day before yesterday the Judiciary Committee dealt with a resolution on this subject. Yesterday, a letter was circulated, which I signed, which was sent to the Attorney General requiring an answer within 30 days. She does not have to agree with the letter which was sent, but she does have to respond. 
Mr. President, we know what has been in the public media. We know that an investigation has been conducted by the Public Integrity Section and by the FBI. The question is raised as to what that investigation has disclosed, which is known to the Attorney General. I believe we ought to have an answer from the Attorney General based upon what has been presented to her from the public record, and an inquiry as to what she knows from the confidential record that she is privy to. 
When the grand jury investigates, those matters are secret. When the FBI investigates, those matters are not made available to the Judiciary Committee. But we have presented a substantial body of material, and I believe we are entitled to an answer not only as to that, but a certification, in effect, from the Attorney General as to what she may know beyond what is in the public record, because that investigation has been going on for a long time, and she is privy to what has occurred with the investigation of the FBI and with the investigation of the grand jury. I think we are entitled to a response on that basis. But there is sufficient material on the record. 
It is my hope that we will not have a filibuster on this resolution but we will be able to take it to a vote. As Senator Dodd said at some length about the filibuster against the McCain-Feingold bill, I broke party ranks, as did a number of Republicans, in voting for cloture on that matter. I am not satisfied with the McCain-Feingold bill, which I have not cosponsored. But I do believe the matter ought to come to the floor and that we ought to offer amendments. We ought to see if a majority of the U.S. Senate is willing to pass campaign finance reform. 
Similarly, on this resolution calling for independent counsel, I think we ought to have a determination up or down as to whether a majority of Senators agree with the letter which we sent over to the Attorney General calling for independent counsel. 
I thank the Chair for sitting on this Friday afternoon when most of our colleagues have left town, and I will soon be returning to Pennsylvania. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in support of the pending business, the constitutional amendment which will authorize the Congress or State legislatures to control campaign finance spending. I believe it is a matter of great urgency that the Congress of the United States deal with the subject of campaign finance reform. 
Day after day we have seen disclosures about very serious violations of existing Federal law and disclosures of very substantial improprieties which call for additional Federal legislation. Regrettably, the opportunities for Federal legislation are sharply restricted by decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States which have limited Congress' ability to act on the stated grounds that such action would violate the first amendment relating to freedom of speech. 
The case of Buckley versus Valeo, decided on January 30, 1976, equated speech with money in a very curious manner. It said that an individual could spend as much of his or her money as he or she chose, but upheld congressional limitations on what others could spend in support of a person's candidacy. 
The Court also left an exception on what is called the independent expenditure. That decision was a very forceful one for me personally, because at that time I was a candidate for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. I was running against John Heinz, who later became a colleague of mine in the U.S. Senate and a very, very close personal friend. At that time, we were friends, too, but we were political opponents. 
Senator Heinz at that time was a Congressman. I had been district attorney of Philadelphia, and we entered that race in April looking forward to the primary. The Federal election provided that someone running in a primary in Pennsylvania would be limited to spending $35,000, computed on a per capita basis for the size of the State. That was about as much money as I had, having been in the practice of law for a short time after having been district attorney of Philadelphia. So it was an even playing field. 
On January 30, the Supreme Court of the United States said that an individual could spend as much of his money as he chose, and John Heinz chose to spend millions. I was limited to my own bank account which was $35,000. As a matter of fact, I spent that. 
At that time, I had a brother who could have financed my campaign, although not on the size perhaps of some others. But my brother, Mort Specter, was limited by law to contributing $1,000 to my campaign. 
It struck me then, and strikes me now, as being curious. Mort Specter's speech was limited to $1,000 in support of his brother, but John Heinz' speech was unlimited. There have been cases of others having come to this body after having spent into the millions of dollars and overwhelming their opponents. Last year, we saw a Presidential election where Steve Forbes came into the field and declined to be bound by Federal spending limits and spent in excess of $30 million, as the reports have demonstrated. 
I believe that there ought to be authority in the Congress to regulate campaign expenditures. The Supreme Court in Buckley and a number of my colleagues here in the Senate have stated that limiting campaign spending would violate first amendment protection of freedom of speech. I take second place to no one in defense of the first amendment and the freedom of speech clause, as well as freedom of religion, freedom of right to assembly, freedom of right to petition the Government. But I believe, as someone who studied the Constitution in depth for some years, that the Buckley decision was wrong as a matter of legal interpretation. 
There are many who agree with that. In fact, on November 10, 1996 some 26 scholars joined together to urge the Supreme Court to reconsider and reverse the decision in Buckley versus Valeo. Among them are some of the most prominent constitutional scholars in the United States, including Pro. Bruce Ackerman of the Yale Law School, Pro. Ronald Dworkin of the New York University Law School, Pro. Peter Arenella of the University of California Law School, Pro. Robert Aronson of the University of Washington Law School, and many, many others. 
Following the statement of the professors, the attorneys general of 24 States called for the reversal of the Buckley decision in January 1997. 
The simple fact is that the Buckley decision makes no sense as a matter of law. Why should an individual be able to spend an unlimited amounted of money when an individual's brother is limited to $1,000 in speech? If freedom of speech applies to a candidate, why does not the same freedom of speech apply to a candidate's brother? 
Freedom of speech has traditionally been limited by Supreme Court decisions. It is not an unlimited, absolute right. You have the famous decision by Oliver Wendell Holmes on clear and present danger. If there is a clear and present danger, speech may be limited. 
The most famous example of limiting free speech is the rule that you cannot cry `fire' in a crowded theater. If you cry `fire' in a crowded theater that endangers other people who would be injured in the stampede for the exits. 
Likewise, you are not free to use a racial or religious slur against somebody. There is a famous Supreme Court opinion on this issue by Justice Murphy. An individual had uttered a racial slur and the target of the slur punched the speaker in the nose. The speaker then sued the individual who hit him for assault and battery. Justice Murphy ruled that the person who had uttered the slur and was punched could not sue. He held that racial slurs were fighting words, and you cannot utter fighting words even within the context of freedom of speech. 
We know from very complex decisions by the Supreme Court that there is a limit as to what you can say in the way of obscenity. If material appeals to the prurient interest, if it is contrary to accepted moral standards, it can be restricted. 
In addition, this body has gotten involved in some very controversial issues in the effort to protect children's viewing on television. So there are clearly limits to first amendment protection. 
As I say, I take second place to no one in wishing to safeguard the first amendment. But I have heard a lot of talk in the U.S. Senate that this amendment would be an invasion of cherished freedoms of speech. I disagree. Money is not speech. Just on its face it is not speech. And to enable the wealthy to, in effect, buy elections is not sound public policy. Congress ought to have the authority to make that change. 
We have seen the most recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States on the subject in Colorado Republican Campaign Committee versus Federal Election Commission, a 1996 decision which defies logic, defies reason, and defies reading to understand what this opinion means. 
There is an opinion by Justice Kennedy concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part with Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justice Scalia joining. 
There is an opinion by Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part, in which Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia joined in part. 
There is an opinion by Justice Stevens with a dissenting opinion, with Justice Ginsburg joining. 
There is another opinion by Justice Breyer joined by Justice O'Connor and Justice Souter. 
All that to the viewing audience on C-SPAN sounds extraordinarily complicated, but you `ain't heard nothing yet.' It 
is a lot more complicated than that. 
In order to have an opinion of the Supreme Court, you have to have five Justices who state a judgment and then articulate an opinion so you know what the ruling of the Court is. There is no opinion which five Justices joined in. You have four Justices saying they have one conclusion, which leads them to the judgment that results, and other Justices saying they have different reasons leading to a judgment. In other words, you have a majority of the Justices agreeing on the conclusion but not agreeing on the reasons. 
You hear the Supreme Court often criticize legislative intent, criticize what the Congress of the United States does because it is not clear. Some Justices, Justice Scalia in particular, say they do not pay any attention to legislative intent because they cannot find it. 
We spend a lot of time on the floor of this Senate seeking to clarify legislative intent: stating what we are trying to accomplish and asking the managers if they agree with that and expect that to be followed, trying to give some guidance because we cannot anticipate every last conclusion and every last consequence when we have legislated. But our muddled congressional activities and actions are clear as crystal compared to what the Supreme Court does frequently as illustrated in this Colorado case. 
By the time you finish reading this case about what parties can do and about what soft money can do, there is absolutely no guidance. That guidance ought to be presented by the Congress of the United States. If we had a constitutional amendment on campaign spending, all of the confusion of the Buckley opinion and the Colorado opinion would be eliminated. 
You have an extraordinary situation where the President of the United States is reported, in the book by his campaign director, Dick Morris, as sitting down and editing the campaign commercials paid for by millions of dollars of soft money collected by the Democratic National Committee. 
Federal election law provides that soft money must be spent on independent expenditures. But money is certainly not being spent independently of President Clinton's campaign if President Clinton sits and edits the commercials. But that is precisely what President Clinton did. 
Some have argued that President Clinton did not violate the election law because the DNC spent soft money and the soft money was used for issue advocacy instead of express advocacy on behalf of a specific candidate. 
The general rule of what constitutes express advocacy for a specific candidate is `vote for Senator Bennett.' That would be express advocacy. Or `vote against Senator Bennett.' But if someone engages in issue advocacy and lists all the votes which Senator Bennett has made which they claim are undesirable and mentions all of the good qualities of Senator Bennett's opponent, that is often considered issue advocacy. That is often not controlled by the Federal election laws. Let's face it, the line between issue advocacy and express advocacy is impossible to draw. 
We are approaching the issue of campaign finance reform in the activities of the Governmental Affairs Committee. This was the subject of heated discussion on this floor, though maybe not as heated as it was in the Republican caucus. The distinguished Presiding Officer was there. I might say, parenthetically, it is very troublesome to have our deliberations among Republican Senators in the caucus reported to the press. I was called by the press. My standard answer is, `I will tell you what I said, but I won't tell you what anybody else said.' Then the reporter says, `Well, do you mind confirming this?' And they repeat exactly what happened in the Republican caucus, which was limited to Republican Senators. Very distressing. That really is a confidential communication that ought to be respected. 
But when we looked at that issue, we came to the conclusion that we have to have a wider scope which includes not only illegal but improper activities. That is because we want to 
correct what has gone on, and not only with the use of these millions of dollars in soft money, but what has gone on in foreign expenditures. We have seen very substantial moneys contributed illegally by foreigners. We know it is illegal because the Democratic National Committee has returned the money. 
When I talk about the Democratic National Committee, I do not wish to be unduly partisan. I favor an inquiry which would take in not only the Democratic Presidential campaign, but the Republican Presidential campaign, and not only the Presidential campaigns but congressional campaigns, so that we would take a look across the board and not with a limited scope. 
But the foreign contributions as disclosed to the media have been received by the Democratic National Committee. And we know they are illegal because the Democratic National Committee has returned a great many. We do not know if they returned them all. This is a matter that we ought to look into. 
Although contributions by foreigners, noncitizens, are illegal, maybe we ought to extend our laws beyond the bounds which we have now. If we are to really be able to regulate campaign money, we are going to have to have the authority to do it without having the Supreme Court hand down the Colorado case and without having loopholes virtually as broad as the planet. 
These are issues of great importance. We have really seen our democracy, our Republic, on the line in terms of what has happened on campaign irregularities. This is something that the Congress ought to take up. The Congress cannot take it up realistically unless we have a constitutional amendment. 
I see my distinguished colleague, Senator Hollings, has come back to the floor. I am happy to start again. I am not sure where he came in.

Mr. SPECTER. I am glad I know that Senator Hollings was here. Otherwise, he would not have made those flattering, complimentary statements. 
I know Senator Hollings has been here all day today and all day yesterday, because I came over to look for an opportunity to speak yesterday and the floor was taken, and earlier today I was looking for a chance to speak, and I came out of hearings on the Agriculture Subcommittee where we have a major problem with dairy pricing in Pennsylvania, which occupied me all afternoon. 
As I was about to say, Senator Hollings has been the leader on this, and it has been the Hollings-Specter constitutional amendment for the better part of a decade. Senator Hollings asked me to join him in the news conference Tuesday morning at 11:30 where we talked about this amendment and campaign finance reform generally, and then questions from the media got into the issue of what the Governmental Affairs Committee would be doing, more broadly than the constitutional amendment. Some of that got on to the wires and stimulated some of the discussion we had later at the Republican caucus. It was synergistic and moved the issue right along. 
It is very difficult to pass this amendment because it takes a two-thirds vote. There is no doubt about that. On May 27, 1993 the Senate adopted by a vote of 52-43 a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that this amendment should be passed, and my sense is that one day this constitutional amendment will pass. It will take a lot of effort. I am not optimistic about its chances at the present time. I do not believe there will be campaign finance reform until the Congress has to act. 
We have in here a conflict of interest in passing campaign finance reform because it benefits incumbents. Some say that the absence of campaign finance reform benefits the Republican Party. I disagree with that. I believe the Republican Party would do just fine with campaign finance reform. I think it would be tougher on incumbents, but we are not going to get it until we do overturn Buckley versus Valeo. 
The Supreme Court has often reversed itself when the Court was wrong, and there have been constitutional amendments when the Court was wrong. We have an amendment process where two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and three-fourths of the States, can change the Constitution--because the U.S. Supreme Court is not the last word. They can be overturned. 
There have been proposals to overturn Supreme Court decisions by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. I would hate to see that happen because we muster two-thirds of the Senate sometimes on issues which may not really reflect long-range interests of the United States. I think it is important to have a high barrier to have a constitutional amendment. I think one day the public alarm, the public dismay, the repugnance of the public will reach a level which will motivate the Congress to have campaign finance reform and to have a constitutional amendment. 
I think it is a solid constitutional principle that money ought not to be equated with speech, and we ought to overturn Buckley versus Valeo and then Congress ought to have sensible legislation to ensure that democracy is protected and our Republic 
is protected. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to voice support for FBI Director Louis Freeh, who has been subject to some criticism in a variety of quarters, including on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I do so as someone who is thoroughly familiar with the work of FBI Director Freeh and of his organization. I have worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation for many, many years, going back to my days as an assistant district attorney of Philadelphia, when I prosecuted the Local 107 Teamsters and got the first conviction of teamsters resulting from the McClellan committee investigation. I worked with the FBI as an assistant counsel on the Warren Commission. I have seen a great deal of the FBI's work since being in the Senate and working as a member of the Judiciary Committee. 
I think the FBI does a good job--not a perfect job, not a job without substantial problems, and not a job where, on some occasions, they don't make mistakes, but a good job. I have seen Director Freeh's work in some detail, specifically, on the oversight hearings that the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism conducted on Ruby Ridge, where I served as chairman. 
Ruby Ridge was a national tragedy. Randy Weaver did some things he should not have done, but he didn't deserve the armada of law enforcement that descended on his mountain in Idaho. That was a sad story, because the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms unit had misrepresented Weaver's record. They said he had a prior record of convictions, which was false. They said he was a suspect in a bank robbery case, which was false. That brought the hostage rescue team from the FBI and the killing of a U.S. Marshal, William Deacon, the killing of Mrs. Randy Weaver and their son, Sam Weaver, age 14. 
To the credit of FBI Director Freeh, he was willing to concede the errors. He changed the rules of engagement, he changed the FBI standards on use of deadly force, and he changed the use of the hostage rescue team. This was in stark contrast to what the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms did. They would not concede their errors. The Department of the Treasury, which managed Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, stood by their conduct, even though it was palpably wrong, as disclosed in the extensive hearings the subcommittee had over the course of 2 months, 16 hearings, and a long report in excess of 150 pages. 
I have seen what Director Freeh has done in combating domestic violence in the Oklahoma City bombing, and I have seen what the FBI has done in the Unabomber case. Where the FBI has made mistakes, Director Freeh has come forward and conceded that. Where there was unwarranted publicity on the Atlanta Olympics pipe bomb case, for example, when someone unfairly leaked information, Director Freeh conceded that a mistake was made. 
While I applaud his concessions on the unfair publicity, I have problems with our inability to properly conduct oversight on that Atlanta pipe bombing case. We have not been able to move that ahead. So that when I evaluate Director Freeh, I do so in the context of someone who sees problems and has been critical, as well as someone who praises the Bureau's overall performance. 
Director Freeh has been criticized on the so-called VANPAC case, which involved the murder of a Federal judge and a civil rights leader. Director Freeh prosecuted this case--he has had a very remarkable career as an assistant U.S. Attorney, a Federal judge, and he left the Federal bench to become Director of the FBI. He was recently criticized because there were alleged errors made by the FBI laboratory in connection with the VANPAC case. The FBI laboratory has admittedly had serious problems. That was one of the aspects that was investigated by the Senate subcommittee on 
Ruby Ridge, because there were problems with their work there, as well. 
As the prosecuting attorney in that criminal prosecution, Director Freeh relied on evidence from the FBI laboratory, some of which may have been faulty. But when Director Freeh found out that that was an area of concern in September of 1995, he recused himself from the investigation of the FBI laboratory. That means he took himself out of the case and did not pass judgment on it. 
The inspector general, who is about as independent as you can be within the Federal branch--has been looking into the FBI laboratory. We have these inspector generals in a variety of departments. My legislation brought the inspector general to the CIA, the only reform legislation coming out of the Iran-Contra affair. Inspectors general are not perfect because it is hard to be totally independent. But to the extent you can have independence, the IGs are independent. They report directly to Congress. They are as good a mechanism as you can have for that sort of an investigation, unless you have congressional oversight. There ought to be more of that. 
But, at any rate, Director Freeh did what was possible by recusing himself and referring the matter to the inspector general, who brought in five independent scientists. He has been out of the case, and he is prepared to make whatever changes are necessary within the FBI laboratory. 
The FBI is currently conducting a very sensitive investigation on campaign irregularities, which may go to the highest levels of Government. 
Not a great deal can be said about that investigation at this time. But from what I have observed Director Freeh has been independent, has been forthright, and has done his job in a professional way. In that kind of an investigation there are inevitable pressures, either express or implicit. I have some familiarity with what the Bureau is doing and what the Director is doing. I have confidence in him. I do so with some understanding of investigative work on grand juries and criminal matters and the kind of sensitivity which is involved. There are matters on which I consult with him with some frequency in terms of oversight. 
As of this moment, I am not yet satisfied with what has been done on Ruby Ridge. The Department of Justice has conducted an investigation on a number of the FBI agents, one of whom was the former Deputy Director, Larry Potts. It may well be as I said, in those hearings, that Director Freeh did not exercise the best judgment with respect to Deputy Director Potts. But at the same time I have said publicly that Deputy Director Potts and others are entitled to have the matter resolved, and that the Department of Justice has been investigating that since the fall of 1995--some 18-month lapse--which is unwarranted. I know that case thoroughly because of the hearings we had. I know investigative practice. That matter should have been concluded. That is not a matter under Director Freeh's purview. It is in the Department of Justice. 
I recently wrote to the Attorney General complaining about the delays and got an unresponsive response saying that the investigation will take several more months due to the complicated nature of this matter. It is not all that complicated. We have the Atlanta pipe bomber case where I have been trying to get an oversight hearing since October-November. I am not delighted with what the FBI has done on that in terms of not being as responsive as I think they might be. They have internal investigations which are really very difficult and which delay congressional oversight. But overall my view is that Director Freeh has done a good job. And when you pick up some of these matters on the FBI laboratory, I think he has provided appropriate management and appropriate oversight. 
Mr. President, I think my time has probably lapsed. But in the absence of any other Senator on the floor, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes to proceed as if in morning business.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation directed at providing health coverage to children who lack health insurance in America. 
This issue has been recognized as one of the leading--if not the leading--problems on incremental health coverage in America today. I am glad that President Clinton's health care plan proposed in 1993 was not adopted. That was a matter that was fought out on the Senate floor in some great detail in 1994. I participated in that debate. When I read President Clinton's health plan, I was amazed by the number of agencies, boards, and commissions, and asked an assistant to make a list of all of them. My assistant made a chart instead of a list. I had that chart on this floor and many other places, and I shall spare you the chart today. Bob Woodward of the Washington Post said that chart was the key factor in defeating the Clinton health care plan because it showed on one page in red more than 100 new agencies, boards, and commissions, and in green about 50 existing bureaus giving new jobs. Then we proceeded, I think wisely, with the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill on incremental health coverage. Now I think we need to go ahead and provide for coverage for children in America. 
Very briefly, let me summarize my proposal before going into specifics. It is said that there are 10 million children who lack health insurance. My analysis shows that there is a critical group, perhaps the most critical group, of some 4 million children which my bill addresses in an incremental way; 3 million other children are eligible for Medicaid coverage but not enrolled, and 3 million other children are in families which would not be eligible for health insurance under my plan because their family income levels are too high. My legislation will provide a pilot program which would provide vouchers to States for families which earn up to 235 percent of the poverty level to purchase health insurance in the marketplace. 
Later today I am going to have a news conference with the Brandt family from Pennsylvania, because they are illustrative of this issue. I would now like to discuss the key elements of my proposal and why I have asked the Brandts to travel to Washington today. 
Mr. President, it is no less true for being a commonplace that nothing could be more important to our Nation than our children. I am introducing today legislation aimed at beginning to fill an enormous and unacceptable gap in our country's support for the health and well-being of our children. 
Mr. President, as President Clinton discussed during the State of the Union Address last month, there are today approximately 10 million American children who have no health insurance coverage from any source--private or public--and who therefore lack access to the kinds of preventive and primary care services which can be the difference between staying healthy and getting sick or between minor illness and serious, disabling or even mortal illness. 
Now, let me say at the outset that this is not a Republican or Democrat issue. Our two parties do have different approaches to the roles and the cost of our Federal Government but there is not one party that cares about kids and one party indifferent to our childrens' health. Let us work constructively on this and actually address the problem rather than just trying to wrack up political points. 
As with most statistics conjured up for social policy debates, the President's figure of 10 million uninsured children needs further discussion to get to the heart of the matter. Of these 10 million uninsured, approximately 3 million children live in families with incomes which make them eligible for Medicaid. I support outreach efforts by the States to enroll these children in Medicaid but, because coverage is accessible to these families if they avail themselves of it, this problem is not the gaping hole in our health care system of which I spoke a moment ago. 
Likewise, of the 10 million uninsured children, another approximately 3 million live in families with incomes greater than the median household income. There are even uninsured children in more than a few high income families. 
Those numbers are deeply disturbing, but I see them as a clarion call for greater parental responsibility, rather than for legislative or governmental action. I know it is easy for those of us with substantial incomes and employer-paid health benefits--such as we here in the Senate--to preach to families without these protections, but I cannot imagine any higher priority for a family with any more than just enough income to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads than to provide health insurance for their kids. And I see it as clearly inappropriate--despite some proposals on the other side of the aisle to do so--to spend tax dollars to subsidize health insurance for higher income families. The cutoff level I propose in this bill, approximately $38,000 for a family of four is already a bit higher than median household income in the United States--$34,076--$34,524 in my own State of Pennsylvania. In other words, taken together, Medicaid and the new initiative I am proposing would allow eligibility by income for more than half of the households in our country. To go beyond that is to do what too many Government programs already do--tax those who have less for the benefit of those who have more, Robin Hood in reverse. 
This leaves approximately 4 million children, ineligible for Medicaid but living in families without the resources to obtain coverage on their own. This is an American tragedy--the tragedy of the working poor. Mom, Dad, or both going to work every day, often more than 5 days per week, but being paid low wages, without health benefits. These are honest taxpaying citizens, but their kids' futures are in jeopardy. They are falling through a crack in our health care system which must be sealed off. 
Some States, including my own State of Pennsylvania, are attempting to address this problem. In Pennsylvania, a public/private partnership, combining a publicly funded program called BlueCHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, on which Governor Ridge will spend $39 million this year, and a private initiative called the Caring Program for Children are reaching 60,000 out of the estimated 300,000 uninsured Pennsylvania children who are not eligible for Medicaid. 
But, as this statistic indicates, even generous State and private resources are wholly inadequate to meet the need. And this need, this hole in our health care system, is not a statistic. It is real. 
I would like to speak to you today about some Pennsylvanians whose stories demonstrate both the real need for action on the matter of uninsured children and the effectiveness of a program, such as the one I am proposing today, in helping real people face life's storms. These good people have been helped by Pennsylvania's existing efforts to provide health coverage to children and their story is the best argument which can be made for a national effort to solve this problem. 
Here with me today is the Brandt family, from Tarentum, PA, in Allegheny County: mother, Scarlett; father, Richard; daughter, Lindsay, age 11; and son Chad, age 7. 
First, I would like to thank the Brandts very deeply for their willingness to be here today, not only because it involves a precious day off from work for both Scarlett and Richard, a day out of school for both Lindsay and Chad and a long car ride to Washington and back, but even more so because it involves a family decision to put pride aside and to be willing to face the press as symbols for a policy debate. This is not an easy position for people to put themselves in--and even less so their children--but the Brandts believe in the need to tell America about this too long ignored problem of uninsured children and about the way life brightens with just a little help to fill this basic need. I am very grateful to them for putting their desire to help others ahead of their own privacy. 
Scarlett and Richard both have full time jobs; Scarlett is a hairdresser and Richard is a truck driver. But neither of their 
employers offer health benefits and this hard working, taxpaying family simply doesn't earn enough money to go out and purchase private health insurance on their own. Before the Pennsylvania programs began helping the Brandts in 1993, Lindsay had lived the first 7 years of her life without any health insurance coverage and her little brother Chad had gone without coverage from birth until he was 3 years old. 
Here, then, are counter examples for the think tank commentators who argue against Federal action on children's health insurance by pointing to examples of children who are only uninsured for transitional periods of months as their parents change jobs. Here, in Lindsay and Chad, are examples of the heart of this problem--the long-term uninsured children of the working poor. 
How did Scarlett and Richard make due without health insurance for their kids? They scrounged what services they could from community health clinics and they used emergency rooms in ways that, when multiplied by all those who act similarly, damage and drain our entire health care system. They also restricted the activities of their children--and recent studies indicate this is a common coping strategy for parents in their shoes--cracking down on sports and even bike riding to try to avoid injuries. When Chad became ill as a toddler, with recurring ear infections, the family had to rotate payments to their creditors--some months skipping a utility bill, some months cutting back on groceries--just to be able to afford the prescription medicines for their little boy. 
Even with all of these ways of dealing with their situation, the Brandts lived every day under a cloud of fear about their children's health and their family's future and Lindsay and Chad lived with unmet health care needs--for physician care, for vision care, and for dental care. 
In 1993 the Brandt family got help from the programs operated by Western Pennsylvania's Caring Foundation for Children. It turned out that this assistance proved even more necessary than they knew at the time. 
In April 1996, Lindsay Brandt was diagnosed with hemiplegic migraines. This condition causes stroke-like symptoms. When an incident occurs, Lindsay suffers paralysis on the side of her body opposite from the headache, her speech slurs, her vision is blurred, and she becomes confused. Although she has needed five ambulance trips to the hospital since developing this condition, Lindsay is now on medication to prevent further episodes. 
Obviously, all of this care has been expensive. Obviously, the sort of problem the Brandts feared in their uninsured years came to pass. It might well have destroyed this family had it happened before they got health insurance coverage for their kids. Thank God, it did not. 
The legislation I am introducing today is a measured response to this major problem. We must react with both compassion and consideration. 
Here is my proposal: 
A 5-year pilot program funded with discretionary dollars--rather than a permanent entitlement--to provide block grants to the States in support of health insurance for uninsured children who are not eligible for Medicaid or for employer-based private health insurance and whose families have incomes up to 235 percent of the poverty level, $37,718 for a family of four. 
States which are already providing health insurance coverage to children eligible under this bill, such as under their own Medicaid plans, would be required to maintain their efforts but would, in effect, receive credit from the Federal Government in the form of dollars equal to the costs of the coverage they are providing to children in families up to the bill's cutoff level of 235 percent of poverty. 
My bill would offer full vouchers, with the level determined by the Secretary of HHS based on costs for an insurance policy covering preventive, primary, and acute care services for a child, for families earning up to approximately $29,700 per year for a family of four and partial subsidies from that income level until phased out at approximately $38,000 for a family of four. 
By limiting eligibility to children who do not have access to employer-based private health insurance, we avoid creating a disincentive to private coverage. We should all applaud the employers who are covering their employees, including lower wage employees, with family health insurance. Indeed, there are approximately 10 million American children in families earning between the poverty line and 235 percent of poverty who do receive private health insurance coverage, compared to the 4 million who do not. This is another example of the overall effectiveness of our market-based health care system even as it is also the most striking example of a particular case of market failure. 
By making this a 5-year pilot program, we admit the complexity of the health care system and the task of health care reform. This approach, with block grants and vouchers, may well prove to be the best way to cover kids who need health insurance, but we all know about the unintended consequences of social policy initiatives and we all know how hard it is to reform an entitlement, even if it has truly perverse effects, and so I am proposing a 5-year demonstration of this approach in the appropriately humble spirit of `trial and correction' which I have many times before said on this floor should inform our entire project of health reform. 
By making this program subject to appropriations, we ensure that we undertake this important effort in a fiscally responsible manner. 
Specifically, to provide sufficient funds to properly test this approach to children's health coverage in a way that does not bust the budget, my bill establishes the `Healthy Kids Trust Fund,' on budget, funded through the sale of available broadcast and 
nonbroadcast spectrum assets. I am not wedded to this offset but offer it to make clear my intention to see this program paid for with hard dollars, not confederate money. 
Furthermore, my proposal provides that: 
The first year of the program, fiscal year 1998, would be devoted to HHS and State planning, with the new insurance coverage commencing on or about October 1, 1998. 
Coverage would be phased in, beginning with children 0-5 years old in fiscal year 1999 and expanding in subsequent years to cover children 6-9, 10-12, and 13-17. 
In the 104th Congress, I was pleased to cosponsor the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, better known as the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill (S. 1028). There is no question that Kassebaum-Kennedy made significant steps forward in addressing troubling issues in health care. The bill's incremental approach to health care reform is what allowed it to generate consensus support in the Senate; we knew that it did not address every single problem in the health care delivery system, but it would make life better for millions of American men, women, and children. 
In retrospect, I urge my colleagues to note a most important fact--the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was enacted only after some Democrats abandoned their hopes for passing a nationalized, big government health care scheme, and some Republicans abandoned their position that access to health care is really not a major problem in the United States demanding Federal action. 
Although we succeeded in enacting incremental insurance market reforms, there is still much we need to do to improve our health care system. Additional reforms must be enacted if we are serious about our commitment to meet the needs of the American people. I am hopeful that my colleagues understand how important it is to our constituents that we continue to reform the health care system. Just look at the Brandt children and multiply their need by millions. Looking back at our success with the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, I am equally hopeful that my colleagues have come to realize that if we are to continue to be successful in meeting our constituents' needs, the solutions to our Nation's health care problems must come from the political center, not from the extremes. 
Mr. President, I hope the legislation I am introducing today can be the basis for taking this next, crucial step in our process of bipartisan, incremental health reform. My proposal seeks to achieve incremental expansion of health care through a conservative means--a fully funded program with carefully crafted eligibility rules for a limited period of time, a program based on State administration and personal choice and responsibility. Let us take this step. Let us make this test. Let us see to it that the anguish and Russian roulette endured by all those situated similarly to the Brandt family are stopped and millions more of our Nation's greatest assets are given a basic ingredient for decent and productive lives. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining on the additional time which I sought independent of Senator Domenici's time?

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the final subject I wish to address briefly involves the problem of mammograms for women age 40 to 49. 
Mr. President, this subject came into sharp focus when a National Institutes of Health panel on January 23 issued a report that mammograms were not warranted for women in the 40 to 49 category. That was immediately met with very widespread criticism, including criticism from Dr. Richard Klausner, the Director of the National Cancer Institute, who said that he was shocked by that conclusion. As the facts later developed, a press release was inadvertently disclosed. Some of the members of the panel had held that mammograms were not warranted. But, as I understand it, that had not been thoroughly analyzed and agreed upon by the panel. But once this press release came out they stood by the release. And there has been enormous confusion in America on this issue of women 40 to 49. 
The subcommittee, which I chair and which has jurisdiction over the Department of Health and Human Services, had a hearing on February 5 at which Dr. Klausner restated his shock about the matter. He thought that the advantages of mammograms for women 40 to 49 had not been appropriately emphasized, and the disadvantages had been emphasized too heavily. He also said that he was going to await a meeting of the National Cancer Institute later in February--on February 24 and 25. It was my understanding that the matter would be resolved at that time. But, in fact, it was not. 
When the Secretary of Health and Human Services testified before our subcommittee on March 4 she said that there would be a 2-month delay, which I said in those hearings was unacceptable. I have since pressed Dr. Klausner as to why there would be such a delay.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when I was dissatisfied with his response, I wrote to Dr. Harold Varmus, Director of the National Institutes of Health, the overall supervisor, on March 6, 1997 asking that there be some acceleration of this determination because no further tests were necessary but only a judgment was needed. What I found was that the matter was being referred to a 7-person subcommittee which was going to deliberate on the issue and then take it up by an 18-person full committee.

Mr. SPECTER. I am concerned that the delays in mammograms could constitute a health hazard for women 40 to 49. And, beyond that, that there is much confusion in America on that subject. The upshot of it has been that there now appears that the subcommittee will render its report to the full committee on this Friday, and there will be a final report rendered next Tuesday which will eliminate the need for accelerated hearings in our subcommittee to try to come to a conclusion on this important matter. 
I emphasize that I appreciate the need for an independent medical judgment on this important subject. 
It seems to me that where all the tests have been performed and it is a matter of issuing guidelines, coming to closure and judgment on this should not require such a lengthy period of time. I believe that there is not a sufficient sense of urgency generally, and in Government specifically, as this issue has been addressed. My views are expressed more fully in these letters, and I shall not take a greater period of time to elaborate upon them here.

Mr. SPECTER. It is my hope, Mr. President, that we will have a definitive statement, as I say, next Tuesday. We need the definitive statement so that we come to closure on the issue, and then it is a matter for scientists acting on their independent judgment. It is my hope and expectation that the abundance of scientific tests which are already available will show that mammograms are important for women 40 to 49. 
When I talk about medical tests, I speak from some personal experience, having had an MRI which disclosed a very serious problem. On these medical examinations, the earlier the better, so I hope we move ahead as promptly as we can. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Exhibit 1 U.S. SENATE, 
Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC, March 5, 1997. 
Richard D. Klausner, M.D., Director, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD. 
Dear Doctor Klausner: I was very distressed to hear Secretary Shalala's testimony yesterday that there will be another two-month delay on having the National Cancer Institute reach a conclusion on whether mammograms are warranted for women aged 40 to 49. 
As disclosed in our previous hearing, the NIH consensus development conference panel press statement of January 23, 1997, was probably inadvertently released. That resulted in a lot of anxiety for women in the 40 to 49 age category and beyond. When you testified before the Subcommittee on February 5, 1997, the expectation was that the matter would be resolved by further NCI proceedings on February 25, 1997. Now we hear that there will not be a definitive statement until early May. 
During the intervening 60 days, thousands of women in the 40 to 49 age category might be screened which could result in the saving of many lives. 
I would appreciate your immediate response as to why the National Cancer Institute cannot make a prompt decision, or in the alternative, give our Subcommittee an earlier date. 
Sincerely, Arlen Specter.   
Exhibit 2 U.S. SENATE, 
Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC, March 6, 1997. 
Dr. Harold Varmus, Director, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. 
Dear Doctor Varmus: With this letter, I am sending you a copy of a letter I sent to Dr. Klausner yesterday. 
Earlier today Dr. Klausner and I had a conversation which I considered totally unsatisfactory. Dr. Klausner had set a time limit of 60 days for the subcommittee to report back to him; and when I said I thought that was unreasonably long, he said they would do it as soon as possible. When I asked him how long that would be, he said he didn't know and referred me to Dr. Barbara Rimer. 
When my Chief of Staff, Craig Snyder, called Dr. Rimer, she advised that 60 days was the outside period with the hope that her subcommittee could act more promptly. Dr. Rimer then outlined a procedure where she had drafted a proposed statement for her subcommittee of 7 members which was circulated today with the response time a week from today. After that, Dr. Rimer expected to have a conference call among 18 members of the full committee to resolve the issue with the hope that all of that could be concluded within 10 days. 
In my opinion, this is an extraordinarily unwieldy procedure and judgments could really be made at the National Cancer Institute since no additional research is necessary. 
If the procedure outlined by Dr. Rimer is followed, I urge you to escalate the pace by having the comments of the 7 subcommittee members returnable next Monday with the conference call of the full 18 members of the National Cancer Advisory Board to be completed promptly thereafter so that the final comments can be completed by the end of next week. 
Again, in my opinion, the Department of Health and Human Services, NIH and NCI do not have an appropriate sense of urgency on this matter. I do not have to tell you how many lives could be saved with prompt screening of women 40 to 49 without the kind of delay occasioned since the first release of January 23. 
I would appreciate your immediate response on this matter. 
Sincerely, Arlen Specter.  
 U.S. SENATE, 
Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC, March 11, 1997. 
Richard D. Klausner, M.D., Director, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD. 
Dear Doctor Klausner: I had asked my staff yesterday to set the hearing for the National Institutes of Health including the National Cancer Institute for March 18 because of my concern about the prospective 60-day delay on the issue of mammograms for women 40 to 49. 
When I heard you were going to be out of the country from March 14 to March 21, I sought to schedule the hearing for this week, on March 13, because the Senate will be out of session from March 24 through April 6 and I did not want to wait so long on this mammogram issue. 
I have since been advised that the NIH subcommittee will circulate its decision to the full committee this Friday and the full NIH committee will act on March 18. While I really believe there has been too much delay up to now on the resolution of this issue, at this point I suppose that's about as expeditious a decision as can be made. 
As I think you understand, my point all along has been that the matter ought to be resolved one way or another. I appreciate and understand the importance of independent medical judgment but the time delays for the NIH subcommittee and full committee frankly puzzle me. When you had expressed your own `shock' on the NIH panel finding back on January 23, and the bulk of the evidence supports mammograms for women 40 to 49, I had thought the matter to be pretty much resolved since there were no further tests to be conducted but only a judgment to be made. It was my thinking that 60 more days from the testimony of Secretary Shalala on March 4 was unacceptable. 
In any event we will await the final guidelines on March 18 and we will defer the NIH/NCI hearing until April at which time we will take up the procedures which you have employed on the issue as well as the other substantive matters affecting the National Institutes of Health including the National Cancer Institute. 
Sincerely, Arlen Specter.  
Exhibit 3 
Mr. President, in recent weeks, I have been holding hearings here in Washington and around my home state of Pennsylvania on the recommendation made on January 23, 1997 by the NIH Consensus Development Conference Concerning Breast Cancer Screening for Women Between the Ages of 40 and 49. The panel concluded, `that the available data did not warrant a single recommendation for mammography for all women in their forties.' Instead, the panel reiterated the 1993 recommendations of the NCI that each women between the ages of 40 and 49 should decide for herself whether to undergo mammography. 
On January 23, 1997 after the press release was issued by the Consensus Panel, Dr. Richard Klausner stated that his own reading of the studies and information presented to the conference, in contrast to past years, was that we now have available more convincing evidence. The evidence is primarily from Swedish population screening studies that there is a statistically significant benefit in terms of reduced death from breast cancer for women who begin screening in their forties. Women in that age group who decide to begin screening should be aware of the increased evidence of benefit and of any potential risk. A women's decision to be screened or not screened should be made on the basis of knowledge. 
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American women and according to the American Cancer Society, nearly 44,000 women will die from the disease this year, and 10,000 of these women will be in their forties, making breast cancer the number one cause of death in this age group. It seems to me that those numbers alone should signal an alarm that women in this age bracket are at great risk. And while mammography is not perfect, it is the best tool currently available. 
FEBRUARY 5, 1997, WASHINGTON, DC 
On February 5, 1997, at a hearing here in Washington, I discussed this issue with a panel of distinguished scientists, including Dr. Richard Klausner, the Director of the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Susan J. Blumenthal, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Women's Health, Dr. David Hoel, a Member of the NIH Consensus Development Conference, Dr. Marilyn Leitch, Associate Professor of Surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, Texas, and Dr. Barbara Monsees, Associate Professor of Radiology and Chief of the Breast Imaging Section of the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. 
Dr. Klausner expressed concern that the balance and tone of the Panel's draft report overly minimized the benefits and overly emphasized the risks for women in their 40s. Dr. Klausner also stated the National Cancer Advisory Board would discuss the screening issue at their next meeting. That meeting took place on February 25, and resulted in the formation of a special subcommittee to develop clear recommendations to the NCI on screening mammography. Dr. Klausner told the subcommittee that the Board intends to complete the process in two months. 
Dr. Blumenthal discussed the Department's efforts to improve breast cancer detection and diagnosis to ensure that today's mammography techniques are of the highest quality. She also stated that breast cancer is perhaps the most dreaded and feared disease in women and that it has become an epidemic in our country: the number of women affected by this disease has increased from 1 in 20 over a time in the 1950s to 1 in 8 today. 
Dr. Blumenthal spoke of the new frontiers in breast imaging such as ultrasound, digital mammography, breast MRI and Positron Emission Tomography as ways to improve early breast cancer detection. She also described the `Missiles to Mammograms' initiative to adapt advanced defense, space, and intelligence imaging technologies from the DOD, CIA and NASA, to more accurately detect breast cancer. 
Next, the Subcommittee heard testimony from David G. Hoel, Ph.D., who is Professor and Chairman of the Department of Biometry and Epidemiology at the Medical University of South Carolina. Dr. Hoel, who is a member of the NIH Consensus Panel briefly outlined the process by which the Panel reviewed available research on the subject and derived its conclusions. Dr. Hoel also detailed the specific questions the panel was charged with answering and further noted that the Panel was restricted to providing answers to specific questions. The Panel is currently involved in completing its work and stated that the Panel's final conclusions would accurately represent the consensus view of its members. 
We then heard from a panel of expert witnesses representing the American Cancer Society, the Breast Cancer Foundation, and the National Breast Cancer Coalition. 
Speaking on behalf of the American Cancer Society was Marilyn Leitch, M.D., who is Associate Professor of Surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School at Dallas. She reaffirmed the American Cancer Society's position that the conclusions reached by the Consensus Panel are at variance with the data presented by both European and U.S. scientists, and therefore did not offer women and their physicians the best guidance possible. She noted that the National Cancer Institute and eleven other organizations in 1989 concluded that women in their forties should have regular mammograms. That position was reaffirmed in 1992 after a subsequent review of the scientific evidence. 
In 1993, however, NCI withdrew its recommendation on the grounds that randomized clinical trials had not shown a statistically significant reduction in mortality among women under age 50. Since that time, however, two Swedish studies and a statistical compilation of eight clinical studies have been released showing solid epidemiological and clinical evidence that routine screening is effective in reducing breast cancer mortality. The Swedish studies showed statistically significant reductions in mortality of 36 percent and 44 percent, respectively, for groups invited to be screened. 
Dr. Leitch conveyed the American Cancer Society's disappointment that the Consensus Panel placed undue emphasis on two issues: the risk of radiation-induced cancer and the issue of false positives and false negatives. She noted that the Society currently recommend that women in their forties be screened every one to two years. Later this month, the Society will convene its own expert panel, however, to determine if, based on new evidence, the mortality benefit might be even greater if women are screened annually. 
The Subcommittee then heard from Ms. Susan Braun and Ms. Diane Rowden, both representing the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports research on breast cancer. 
Ms. Braun noted that when breast cancer is found in its earliest stages, the likelihood of 5-year survival is over 95 percent, but when found after it has metastasized, that survival rate drops precipitously--to 20 percent. Clearly, early detection is a key to longevity. And while she points out that mammography is far from a perfect tool, it has proven to save lives. Ms. Braum contends that the benefits of early screening outweigh the risks, and that is why the Komen Foundation guidelines recommend screening every one to two years, beginning at age 40. Ms. Rowden reaffirmed that position. She cited data estimating that in 1996, women in their forties would account for 18.1 percent of newly diagnosed invasive breast cancers, compared with 16.8 percent for women in their fifties. 
We next heard from Frances M. Visco, Esquire, the first President of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and a member of its Board of Directors. Ms. Visco told the Subcommittee that her breast cancer was diagnosed through a mammogram when she was 39 years old. She stated that we cannot act as though the issue whether to recommend screening for women age 40 to 49 is the most important question surrounding breast cancer and that our outrage should be saved for the fact that we do not know how to prevent the disease, how to cure it, how to detect it at an early stage, or what to do for a women once we do find it. 
Ms. Visco went on to ask what is the goal? A simple message that is less confusing? She stated that in this situation, the simple message is wrong. She further stated that we want mammography to work for all women. It does not. We want to reduce breast cancer to a sound byte. It cannot be. We should be devoting our resources to designing mechanisms to get the message out to women; to get them to understand the risks, the benefits, the pros, the cons, so they can make their own decision. 
Ms. Visco also told the Subcommittee in her view $590 million should be devoted at the NIH to research on breast cancer and $150 should be spent for research purposes at the Department of Defense. 
Ms. Visco concluded that women cannot continue to be given false hope. If women in their 40s are told to get a mammogram every year, we are saying ignorance is bliss. What we need to tell them is that there are pros and cons, there are risks and benefits. That is the information they need to get. Then let them decide the course of their own care. 
Our last witness was Barbara Monsees, M.D., who is Chief of the Breast Imaging Section at Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. She shared her unique perspectives as both a medical professional and as a woman who survived early breast cancer detected by a mammogram. 
Dr. Monsees confirmed the fact that there appears to be clear scientific evidence that early screening can substantially reduce the death rate from breast cancer. She, too, cited the findings from five major population-based screening programs in Sweden. Two of the trials showed mortality reductions of 44 percent and 35 percent, respectively, while an overview study of all five indicated a 23 percent mortality reduction. 
Unfortunately, according to Dr. Monsees, the NIH Consensus Panel chose to ignore this most recent data, resulting in `an unbalanced presentation of the facts . . .' Dr. Monsees raised some provocative questions, such as `Could this issue have taxed the NIH consensus development model beyond its intended purpose?' And `Were the panelists given adequate time, information and instruction regarding the rules of evidence in order to formulate their report?' In conclusion, she voiced hope that the National Cancer Advisory Board will re-examine all the evidence in an unbiased fashion, and conclude that screening women in their forties does save lives.  
FEBRUARY 20, 1997, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA 
On February 20th, 1997, I reconvened the Subcommittee for our hearing in Philadelphia. 
I opened the hearing with a report on a promising opportunity I learned of last year, whereby certain defense imaging technology may prove useful in more accurately detecting breast cancer in its early stages. I saw to it that this project received the necessary funding, and I look forward to seeing the results. 
Once again, we heard from a very distinguished group of witnesses, led off by Dina F. Caroline, M.D., Chief of the Division of Gastrointestinal Radiology and Mammography at Temple University Hospital. 
Dr. Caroline began by tracing the history of mammographic screening for women in their forties, beginning in 1977, when the National Cancer Institute and the American College of Surgeons recommended it for women with first degree relatives with breast cancer. Where the controversy came to a head was in 1993, when NCI reversed its stance, stating that experts do not agree on the value of routine screening for women in their forties. 
In subsequent testimony, Dr. Caroline noted the concerns of the NIH Consensus Panel with respect to false positive results. But as she points out, until technology improves, we must expect false positive readings simply because the whole purpose of screening is not to miss any opportunity to identify breast cancer. False negatives are also a problem. But with new techniques in development, hopefully these will begin to diminish in number. 
In conclusion, Dr. Caroline finds the available data sufficient enough to advocate screening for women in their forties. 
Our next witness was Stephen Feig, M.D., Director of Breast Imaging and Professor of Radiology at Jefferson Medical College. Like other witnesses, Dr. Feig cited the latest clinical studies which found that current mammographic techniques should be able to reduce breast cancer deaths by at least 40 percent. He went on to point out that 20 percent of all breast cancer deaths and 33 percent of all years of life expectancy lost to breast cancer are due to cancer found in women in their forties. Not to advise screening in this age group, he contends, is unconscionable. 
The Subcommittee then heard from Daniel C. Sullivan, M.D., the Chief of Breast Imaging at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, and a member of the NIH Consensus Panel. Dr. Sullivan was careful to point out that the Panel's statement that has raised so much controversy is only a draft version. More importantly perhaps, Dr. Sullivan advocates annual mammography for women in their forties and emphasized his hope that the Panel's final statement will reflect that position. He went on to underscore the need for more research, as well as improved access to mammography through more consistent insurance coverage. 
Bonita Falkner, M.D., a Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics at the MCP Hahnemann School of Medicine at the Allegheny University of the Health Sciences and Acting Director of the Institute for Women's Health noted in her testimony that the controversy over the scientific merit of mammography in younger women should not confuse the facts for women 50 and above. She also stated that all women in their 40s should have access to a physicians counseling on mammography, and she found it particularly troubling that the Panel's failure to endorse screening has the potential to lead to a failure on the part of insurers to pay for the procedure. Dr. Falkner stated with the increased mortality rate among minority and disadvantaged women, particular efforts must be made to provide access to physician counseling and breast screening for these women at all ages. 
The Committee then heard from Robert C. Young, M.D. Dr. Young is the President of the Fox Chase Cancer Center and in his testimony, Dr. Young maintains that for women under age 40, without other risk factors, the risk of breast cancer is quite low and there is no convincing argument for mammography screening at all. Where the gray zone occurs, he notes, is in women between the ages of 40 and 50, where there is generally a lower incidence of breast cancer, difficulty in detecting the disease, and differences in the biology of the tumors themselves. Because of these complications, small or short-term studies fail to yield clear results. In order to arrive at more definitive results, larger, long-term trials are required. And as he points out, trials such as those done in Sweden have shown small but definite improvement in survival rates. 
Moreover, Dr. Young made an important point in his testimony: That guidelines are just that--guidelines. And in the case of mammography screening for women in their forties, even though the benefit may be small, the risk is minuscule. He contends that ultimately the solutions will be found through research that addresses the more fundamental questions and leads to new ways to prevent or eliminate this horrible disease. 
The next witness to appear before the Subcommittee was Ms. Barbara De Luca, the Executive Director of the Linda Creed Breast Cancer Foundation. Ms. De Luca highlighted the Consensus Panel's conclusion that there is no clear indication that yearly mammograms for women in their forties save lives. She contends that the Panel's conclusion was based on economic reasons, that mammograms cost money. She went on to report on a small sampling of her Foundation's members. The women she surveyed were diagnosed with breast cancer in their forties. While mammograms had failed to discover their cancer, each of those surveyed felt strongly that women in their forties, nevertheless, should be encouraged to undergo screening every year. 
Ms. De Luca reported that a mammogram done seven years ago had failed to identify her breast cancer, but that since that time new modes of detection have been developed, including the MRI and digital mammography. She recommended that tools like MRI should be made more accessible and less expensive. She urged more research be directed to finding a blood test or other methods to turn off cancer cells and arrest the disease. This, coupled with early detection, can mean finding an effective cure for breast cancer. 
Ms. Lu Ann Cahn, a reporter for WCAU-TV testified that her experience was similar to Ms. De Luca, in that her mammogram failed to detect the cancer. And also like Ms. De Luca, she was appalled by the Consensus Panel's failure to recommend annual mammograms for women in their forties. She noted that this year 6,000 women in their forties will die of breast cancer, while the NIH is relaying a confused message that many women will take to mean they need not worry. 
In a very compelling fashion, Ms. Cahn concludes that the recommendation of the consensus panel has given every woman who wants to avoid mammograms an excuse to do so. 
The Subcommittee once again heard from Ms. Frances M. Visco, Esq., the President of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and a breast cancer survivor. Ms. Visco spoke out in support of the consensus panel's findings. But more importantly she urged that we devote our resources to empowering women to understand the available information and discuss it with their physician. She issued a call to arms of sorts, urging us to focus more of our resources and energy on convincing more women in their fifties to be screened and to support a greater investment in research to find a cure, effective treatment, and more accurate ways to detect breast cancer. And she called for a greater commitment to guaranteeing access to quality health care for all women and their families. 
Ms. Visco once again told the Committee, as she did in Washington, DC on February 5, 1997, that the National Breast Cancer Coalition is recommending $590 million in research dollars at the NIH and $150 million for the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program. Ms. Visco stated that these figures were based on the percentage of proposals that are scientifically valid, but are not funded because of the lack of resources. 
We then heard from Barbara Mallory, M.S.N., R.N., who represented the Nurses of Pennsylvania, an advocacy group for nurses and patients. Her contention is that every health professional she knows suspects that far too much consideration was given to the financial rather than the human costs associated with mammograms. 
Her organization has been very active in this field, drafting legislation ending so-called drive-through mastectomies. In her position as a nurse she has encountered many women, some as young as 33, who have had breast cancer diagnosed as a result of self-examinations and mammograms. 
Ms. Mallory went on to cite statistics about Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), where, since the mid-1980s, there has been a 200 percent increase in the number of lesions detected by mammography. About one-half of these lesions have been found in women under age 50. Up to 25 percent will lead to invasive cancers. While mammography techniques need to be improved, she argues that ambiguous messages and too much attention to the financial bottom-line do a great disservice to the women of this Country. 
Our last witness for the day was Lawrence Robinson, M.D., M.P.H., the Deputy Commissioner of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health. 
Dr. Robinson told of his strong support for mammography screening for women between the ages of 40-49 and stressed this particularly for African American and Hispanic women. Dr. Robinson reported on a study done at a health event sponsored by the Philadelphia Health Department, the Pennsylvania National Guard and the Fox Chase Cancer Center where a mobile mammography unit performed 43 mammograms. Many of the women screened were under 50. The screening found 6 abnormal readings or 15% of those screened. This result points out the need to do screening particularly in underserved areas.  
FEBRUARY 24, 1997, PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA 
The third in a series of special hearings was convened on February 24th in Pittsburgh. I opened the hearing by telling the witnesses that the more I hear about this subject, the stronger I feel that the National Cancer Institute should take whatever steps are necessary to resolve this issue in favor of recommending regular mammograms for women in their forties. 
At this hearing, we heard from two panels of distinguished witnesses, led off by Thomas S. Chang, M.D., who is Assistant Professor of Radiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and staff radiologist at Magee-Women's Hospital. 
Dr. Chang specializes in women's imaging, with a significant portion of his practice devoted to breast imaging. As an expert in this field, he reported being disappointed by the Consensus Panel's inconclusiveness on this issue, noting that the Panel did nothing to clear the confusion that now exists. While the panel may have concluded that insurers should pay for mammograms for women who want one, he is concerned that companies will interpret the Panel's overall conclusions as not requiring them to reimburse the cost of this procedure. In short, many women--especially those who are economically disadvantaged--will have their minds made up for them as a result of financial constraints. 
Dr. Chang went on to report that breast cancer is far more common in women in their forties than some have implied. In 1996, in fact, there were more breast cancers diagnosed in women in their forties (33,400) than women in their fifties (30,900). 
Dr. Chang is convinced that mammography saves lives and is a medically effective screening test for women in their forties. He advises his patients to have regular mammograms once a year, and encouraged the NIH to make the same recommendation. 
Dr. Howard A. Zaren, Director of the Mercy Breast Center for the Pittsburgh Mercy Health Systems told the Subcommittee that in 1997, 11,000 new cases and 2,700 deaths from breast cancer will occur in Pennsylvania. These figures place Pennsylvania within the top five states for highest incidence and mortality from breast cancer. He further stated that almost 20 percent of all breast cancer deaths, and 34 percent of all years of life expectancy lost, result from cancers that are found among women younger than the age of 50 years. 
Dr. Zaren also stated that epidemiologic studies show a shift towards diagnosing breast cancer at earlier stages in women 40-49, and this is regarded as indirect evidence of a possible benefit from screening these women. He also cited the statistics of Dr. Stephen A. Feig, from Thomas Jefferson University, who had testified before the Subcommittee in Pittsburgh, that a mortality reduction of up to 35 percent can be expected if annual screening mammograms are performed in the 40-49 age group with current mammographic techniques and two-views per breast. 
Our next witness was Dr. Victor G. Vogel, Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology and Director of the Comprehensive Breast Cancer Program at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and Magee-Women's Hospital. Dr. Vogel told the committee that mammographic screening holds the promise of early detection of breast cancer in a curable stage. He also commented on the eight randomized studies on which the consensus panel based their recommendation. He stated that the studies show unequivocally that for women ages 50 to 59 years, mammography reduced the chance of dying from breast cancer by approximately 30 percent. However, only one study was designed specifically to investigate screening in women 40 to 49 and that study was seriously flawed. However, meta-analysis from screening studies demonstrates a 24% reduction in breast cancer mortality attributed to screening when women in their 40s are compared with women of the same age who are not screened. 
Dr. Vogel also cited some very interesting statistics stating that in Pennsylvania there are nearly 1 million women between the ages of 40 and 49, and nearly 2,000 will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year. Tragically, as many as 1,000 of these women may die. In his opinion, that number could be reduced by approximately 250 deaths if women between the ages of 40 and 49 were screened annually with mammography. 
Our next witnesses was D. Lawrence Wickerham, M.D. Associate Chairman and Director of Operations for the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project. Dr. Wickerham stated that his greatest concern is that the consensus statement not be used by insurance carriers as a reason to deny coverage for mammograms. He further stated that he did not disagree with the consensus statement which directs women to decide for themselves whether to undergo mammography. He felt that in order to make an informed choice, women and their health care providers need to have the best possible educational materials to aid them in these decisions. He felt that there is likely to be a sliding scale of benefit for women in their 40's and that potential benefits can be assessed by a woman in consultation with her health care provider and based on her individual circumstances. 
Diane F. Clayton testified she is a breast cancer survivor mainly due to early detection. The ductile carcinoma in-situ was found during a routine mammogram--she was 46 years old. 
Ms. Clayton questions the NIH consensus panel's motives. Was it money driving their direction? Was it ignorance? Was it politics? Who could be against preserving extending the lives of mom, sis, Aunt Mary and grandma? Her hope was the recommendation was an honest effort that just went bad. She felt that if it was a mistake then we should admit it and go forward by doing the right thing; advice and counsel women in their forties to have routine mammograms. 
The Subcommittee then heard from Ms. Judy Pottgen, a 47 year old woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 43. Ms. Pottgen found her breast cancer by self breast exam. She is passionate about educating women about self breast exam. She described a program called `check it out', a Pittsburgh program sponsored by the American Cancer Society, Hadassah, and the Allegheny County Board of Health. The program teaches junior and senior high school girls the proper way to do self breast exam. 
Ms. Pottgen summed up her testimony by telling the Subcommittee that preventive medicine is a lot cheaper than therapeutic medicine and that a mammogram is a lot cheaper than major surgery followed by radiation and chemotherapy. She cited the NIH recommendation, many years ago, that yearly Pap smears were unnecessary and wondered how many women missed the opportunity to have their cervical cancer diagnosed at an early stage. She wondered if it would be the same with mammograms, and questioned how many women will lose their breasts or be disfigured or die from this dreaded disease before NIH realizes the tremendous diagnostic benefit of mammograms. 
The next witness was Ms. Yvonne D. Durham, an African American breast cancer survivor who found her cancer through self breast exam. She was 46 years old. She stated that she was deeply troubled by the Consensus Panel's decision not to recommend regular mammogram screening for women beginning at age 40 and told the Subcommittee that the recommendation sends a confusing message to the public. 
Ms. Durham cited statistics based on data from 1987, that African American women, age 35-44, had a breast cancer mortality rate 2 times that of white women at the same age. Yet African Americans, as well as Hispanic Americans, have some of the lowest mammogram screening rates in the United States. 
Ms. Durham concluded her testimony by stating that the benefit of mammography far outweighs any risks associated with this screening test. She also urged continued support for research efforts that may offer a clearer understanding of how breast cancer disease affects minority populations. 
The last witness of the day was Ms. Laurie S. Moser, the Executive Director of the Pittsburgh Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation Race for the Cure. Ms. Moser was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in-situ in 1987 at the age of 40. 
She stated that the Komen Foundation strongly disagrees with the latest decision from the NIH Consensus Development Conference on Breast Cancer Screening for Women Ages 40-49. She also told the Subcommittee that an estimated 16.5 percent of new breast cancer cases were women in their 40s. The position of the Foundation is that the Panel's position overstated potential risks and understated the benefits of mammography. The fact is that many consumers look to the opinion of a body of experts to interpret data and provide recommendations which they can weigh as they make decisions. The current Panel statement does nothing more than confuse the public about an extremely important issue. 
Ms. Moser stated that when the Race for the Cure began in Pittsburgh in 1993, a woman died every 11 minutes from breast cancer. Today, a woman dies every 12 minutes. Over 2,000 additional lives are saved each year with early detection. The goal should be to add a minute each year in the hope that more and more women will survive breast cancer. 
Ms. Moser concluded that she hoped Dr. Klausner and his colleagues at the cancer institute take a closer look at the conference recommendation and see to it that women are given the highest degree of encouragement to get screening earlier, rather than later.  
MARCH 3, 1997, HERSHEY, PENNSYLVANIA 
On March 3, I convened a hearing at the Hershey Medical Center. 
The Subcommittee's first panel consisted of a distinguished group of physicians from the local medical centers. Our first witness was James F. Evans, M.D., Director, of Surgical Oncology and Assistant director of General Surgery from the Geisinger Clinic. 
Dr. Evans, expressing his personal opinions, stated that he had studied the clinical trial data and if he were to write his own consensus statement, it would say that the available data specifically does not warrant a single guideline recommendation for women between the ages of 40 and 70 years, namely annual screening. However, guidelines are not recommendations for individual women. He further stated that we would all like to have enough data to make specific recommendations for each individual based on personal profiles and highly specific reliable research data. But that data does not exist. The best data we have comes from trials and that data supports a guideline recommendation for annual screening beginning at age 40. Clinicians and women themselves should then use additional but less reliable data that we have to make decisions for individuals. 
Our next panelist was Mary Simmonds, M.D., Chief of the Division of Medical Oncology for Pinnacle Health Systems in Harrisburg. Dr. Simmonds stated that she supported the American Cancer Society recommendations that women in their 40s should undergo screening mammography every one to two years. 
Dr. Simmonds also shared with the Committee a copy of Recommendations for a Statewide Plan for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer formulated as a result of deliberations of a Pennsylvania Breast Cancer Awareness Consensus Conference. The recommendations from this conference were that (1) mammography saves lives; (2) women should have a mammogram even if you don't have any symptoms; (3) women should ask their doctor for information about mammography and for access to mammography (4) follow the American Cancer Society guidelines for the frequency of mammography and physical examination of the breast as well as the performance of breast self examination. 
Testifying on behalf of the Hershey Medical Center was David M. Van Hook M.D., and Assistant Professor of Radiology and Chief of Mammography at the medical center. Dr. Van Hook told the Subcommittee that although an analysis of the combined data from the seven population-based randomized-controlled trials, which included over 170,000 women in their 40s, demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in reducing mortality from breast cancer, and data from several other studies also support a benefit to women 40-49. But, the problem seems to be that thus far there has been no single randomized-controlled trial which has showed statistically-significant proof of benefit from mammography screening for women ages 40-49. Dr. Van Hook further stated that much more is at stake here than just dollars spent to save lives and that the decisions regarding health care intervention which affects our society should perhaps, involve not only science, but should also take into account the willingness of those most affected by those decisions. To accept some degree of uncertainly, especially when there is controversy or less than scientific proof of benefit. Dr. Van Hook concluded by saying that the beneficiaries of breast cancer screening, those who stand to gain or lose the most from it, our mothers, wives, and daughters are willing to do just that. 
The Committee then turned to Lois A. Anderson, Co-Facilitator and Founder of A surviving Breast Cancer Support group and Co-Captain of York County Pennsylvania Breast Cancer Coalition. Ms. Anderson expressed her outrage by the NIH Consensus Conference's decision on mammography screening for women 40 to 49. 
Ms. Anderson described her own experience with breast cancer. She was diagnosed when she was 40 years old. Her mammogram failed to detect the disease and after some suspicious bruising, Ms. Anderson found a lump while doing a self breast exam. A mastectomy was performed one month later and 5 of 11 lymph nodes were found to be cancerous. These findings made her a stage III breast cancer patient with less than a 40 percent chance of surviving 5 years. 
Ms. Anderson said that the incidence of breast cancer in younger women is increasing and the NIHs decision to NOT recommend mammograms for women below 50 years of age will certainly cause an increase in the death rate from breast cancer. 
Ms. Anderson presented the Subcommittee with letters from over 226 women under the age of 50 who have been diagnosed with Brest cancer through the use of a mammogram. 
Ms. Anderson told the Committee that while breast cancer is not perfect, it is the best tool we have for detecting breast cancer early and that deadly confusion over screening mammography will result from the NIH's decision if these guidelines are not changed. 
Next the Subcommittee heard from Ms. Lorene Knight, a volunteer with the American Cancer Society and a member of the Pennsylvania Breast Cancer Coalition. Ms. Knight is a 54 year old African American women, and a 7-year breast cancer survivor. Ms. Knight told the Subcommittee that her first mammogram was performed at the age of 36 because of the presence of fibrocystic tissue and a family history of breast cancer. Her sister lost her life to the disease at the age of 43 and her mother is a 5 year breast cancer survivor. 
Ms. Knight stated that she was most disturbed by the findings of the NIH Consensus Development Conference statement and felt that their statement would lure entirely too many women of all races, and in their 40s, into a false sense of security about the odds that breast cancer will not likely happen to them during this decade of their lives. 
Citing recent statistics from 4 hospitals in Lancaster County, Ms. Knight stated that one hospital, during the 95-96 fiscal year, 105 women underwent breast cancer surgery and nearly 36% of them were under the age of 50. At a second hospital, 21 women underwent breast cancer surgery and 8 of the 21 women were under the age of 50. She also told the Subcommittee that as a volunteer with the American Cancer Society's Reach to Recovery program, she has yet to visit one recovering breast cancer patient that is African American. She believes that this is because not enough African American women are having early detection procedures. The breast cancer mortality rate for African American women increased by 2.6% at a time when the mortality rate in white women declined by 5.5%. 
Ms. Knight concluded that every women, of every race, in every community should have access to mammography at age 40 if that is what she determines to be necessary for her, dictated by family history, her physician and her personal health factors. 
Our last witness of the day was Representative Katie True, who represents the 37th legislative district in Pennsylvania. Ms. True told the Subcommittee that one of the weapons that she has chosen to fight breast cancer is House Bill 134. This bill which has already passed the House, would provide for a state income tax checkoff for breast cancer research. The donation is deducted from the tax refund and does not constitute a change against the income tax revenue's to the State. 
Representative True also stated that the second weapon used to battle breast cancer is education. She stated that self breast exams combined with mammograms can save many lives. Women still hesitate to look after themselves first, usually putting others needs before their own. 
Representative True concluded that the recommendation of the NIH Consensus Development Conference on Breast Cancer Screening is irresponsible, and she questioned the motives behind such a recommendation--plain and simple--their message is wrong and deadly.  
MARCH 4, 1997--WASHINGTON, DC 
On March 4, 1997, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala appeared before the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education to discuss the fiscal year 1998 budget. 
At that hearing, I took the opportunity to discuss the NIH Consensus Development Conference recommendations with the Secretary and asked her to take immediate steps towards encouraging women ages 40-49 to undergo mammogram screening. I told the Secretary that the panel finding that mammograms were not warranted for women in the age bracket 40 to 49 has caused quite a stir. And that my own view is that the evidence is substantial, if not overwhelming, that mammograms are very helpful for women of this age group, they do save lives, and that there ought to be a prompt conclusion by HHS to that effect. When there is a public determination that mammograms are not warranted for women 40-49, many women are reading that to mean that a mammogram is not necessary. I also told the Secretary that I felt that there is not a sufficient sense of urgency in the approach that the Department is taking with regard to this issue in allowing another 60 days to pass before a final judgment is made on this issue. I further stated that when it's a matter of dollars and cents, and there is no clear scientific evidence to the contrary, I think the word ought to come from the Secretary of Health and Human Services that, notwithstanding the cost, we're going to make sure that mammograms are made available to women ages 40-49. 
Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my colleague from New Mexico. I congratulate him for this resolution focusing on character. He has been a leader since his election in 1972. Again, he has demonstrated that today with this resolution on character. I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of the resolution. It is an effort to focus national attention on values and morality, and to try to instill in our young people and our older people, as well, a sense that character does count. 
This is in line with legislation that Senator Santorum and I have introduced on abstinence. I have found that the issue of abortion, the pro-life/pro-choice controversy, is the most divisive issue facing this country since slavery, and that one way to try to pull the country together is to focus on issues where we all agree. When you talk about premarital sex among teenagers, leading to unintended pregnancies, and therefore ultimately abortions, we can all agree that such behavior must be discouraged. That is an effort in a specific, targeted way to try to develop and promote character. So I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleague on that important subject.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Tennessee for allowing me some of his time, as well as the 10 minutes. I will try to be relatively brief to move the process along. 
Mr. President, this has been a good showing by the U.S. Senate today as we have come together on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and Democrats, trying to structure an inquiry and hearings which will help reform the American campaign system where virtually everyone agrees there is too much money in it, and it is a very troublesome factor. 
The vote was 99-0, with one abstention, to broaden the scope of this investigation to include improper as well as illegal activities. I think we have achieved a very significant broadening of the committee's charge. It really is very close to what the committee did initially on a unanimous vote, nine Republicans and seven Democrats, saying we would investigate both illegal and improper activities. It was narrowed by the Rules Committee, and now it has been broadened again, and for very important reasons. 
One reason is that we may expect everything our committee does to be subjected to the most microscopic minute examination and legal challenge. Already, there have been two challenges by those under subpoena on subpoenas already issued by the committee. If we had a charter which allowed us to look only at illegal activities, it might well be held by a court someday that such an investigation was beyond the scope of what the Congress or the Senate could do, because our function is to legislate or our function is to have oversight. Our function is not to prosecute. Our function is not to go into matters that just are illegal. When we go into matters which are improper, then it is with a view to changing the law. This is our legitimate function. 
Now, it could be said that we could look into illegal matters from a narrower point of view to change the penalty, but that is very constrictive and might well fail. We could have been tied up for a long period of time if we only had illegal activity with someone mounting a challenge that it was beyond the scope of what Congress could do. 
Also, if we are dealing only with illegal activity, there are many interpretations that might be made as to what is legal and what is illegal, and when those issues are raised they go to court and that can take a very long time. For example, Dick Morris, the President's campaign impresario, wrote in his book that President Clinton was personally involved in editing the commercials which were paid for by the Democratic National Committee with so-called soft money. 
Now that would appear on its face to be illegal because you may have independent expenditures but you may not have coordinated expenditures when someone has accepted public financing. But the argument was made that what was done was legal. I am not saying the President did it. This accusation is written in a book and it is inadmissible hearsay. We have to find out about it. Someone could challenge our inquiry if we were limited to illegal activities, although on the face, if true, this allegation certainly has all the appearance of illegality. 
Last Thursday the Attorney General said that it was not a contribution under the statute for someone to give thousands of dollars, millions of dollars, in soft money because that is used only on issue advocacy instead of urging the election or defeat of a specific candidate. So that if someone gave $1,000 where the money is used to, say, elect John Jones or defeat Frank Smith, that would be a contribution, but the millions of dollars in soft money 
would not be a contribution under the statute. In my legal judgment, that is palpably incorrect, but someone could raise that kind of a consideration. 
So I think we have taken a very, very significant step forward here in expanding the scope to cover improper and illegal activities, and as the distinguished chairman pointed out, that gives us an opportunity to serve the American public by having campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, I had asked for this special 10 minutes because of another deep concern I have in the resolution that is currently drawn, and that is with an ending date of December 31, 1997. When you have a cutoff date, it is an open invitation to people who want to avoid the investigation to engage in legal maneuvers which might well be construed to be stalling tactics, although they have a right to do so, which could delay the matter long past the expiration day. For example, where someone is subpoenaed and the person then pleads the privilege against self-incrimination under the fifth amendment, which the individual would have a constitutional right to do, it would be up to the committee and the Congress to bring forward a charge of contempt of Congress because the Congress cannot impose a penalty but has to go for enforcement to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. That all takes time. Then if the individual loses, they have a right to take an appeal to the circuit court of appeals, then appeal for a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. 
So one of the important items I think we need to have a discussion on here today is what we will do when we face that situation. The mood of the Senate was not such that we could get into extensive amendments of this resolution and we agreed not to offer amendments. I think we can cover this matter reasonably well by having a discussion with the distinguished chairman, the distinguished ranking member. The committee can always come back to Congress and ask for an extension. 
What I seek to do here today, Mr. President, is to get a sense from the managers as to the circumstances where we would ask for an extension. I do not say these are the sole circumstances, but illustratively, if someone is subpoenaed and that individual pleads the fifth amendment, privilege against self-incrimination, granted immunity, ordered to answer, refuses to answer, and there is a contempt citation, it goes to the district court and the circuit court and then the Supreme Court, I ask my distinguished colleague from Tennessee, the chairman of the committee, if that would be an appropriate time for our committee to ask for an extension, and I will ask the same question of the distinguished ranking member, Senator Glenn, if that would be an appropriate circumstance for our committee to seek an extension and obtain an extension from the full Senate for whatever time we lost by those legal proceedings to compel an answer to that question, and, also, then to complete whatever leads that may result? We know it is not just the answer that the witness would give but it might lead to other evidence, and otherwise if we did not have an extension of time we would be stymied on our legitimate investigation. 
I ask my colleague from Tennessee if that would be an occasion for us to get an extension beyond the December 31st cutoff.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for those answers. He has expanded beyond the example I gave of a stalling witness to take in other matters. There might be a challenge to our entire investigation, which is not possible for us to anticipate today, and legal challenges might occur, or other impediments, which may come before the investigation or may occur to lead us to seek additional time. I am glad to hear the Senator say--and he put it in the Record--that he discussed it with the leadership and members of the Rules Committee, as I have. 
Frankly, I don't like the cutoff date. But people who might tend to delay or wear us down will be on notice that we are not unaware of that, and that we have anticipated it, to the maximum extent possible. 
I would like to address a question to the ranking member, the Senator from Ohio, and ask if he agrees with what the chairman has replied to in the colloquy.

Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague for that answer. We do know that investigations take a very long time, and it is not my preference to have a cutoff date of December 31. I think that is very difficult. But the reality is that we faced obstacles in the Rules Committee which limited the scope, and now we have broadened them and limited the time. You have Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, who has been on an investigation for 3 years. You have had independent counsel on Iran-Contra on the investigation for many years. The Senator from Tennessee and I, in 1995, were on an investigation of Ruby Ridge. We had 15 days of hearings and 70-some witnesses. We filed a 150-plus page report, all from Labor Day to the end of the year, in 4 months. And the Department of Justice has undertaken an investigation involving four FBI agents who may not have told the entire story. They started that inquiry in late 1995, and 15, 16, 17 months have passed. 
I recently wrote to the Attorney General and asked her when she is going to finish the investigation so we can conclude, and I got a reply that it is still months away. 
The Senator from Ohio is correct. When I was district attorney of Philadelphia, I ran lots of grand jury proceedings and investigations. I know from experience that we are going to face the most tenacious and microscopic examinations by the best lawyers in the country coming to look at everything we do. I don't like to see a December 31 date. But now it has been established, as best we can on the floor, as a target date. We are going to respond, and we will extend the time if we have to. 
Let us put people on notice that they cannot gain anything by delaying with frivolous lawsuits. If they take up our time, we are going to get an extension of the time. I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the constitutional amendment. I know you have a hard time seeing me over the big stack of budgets which have not been balanced. I support this amendment because I think Congress needs the discipline, the discipline itself to live within its means. 
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the city of Philadelphia, the Arlen Specter household, all have to live within their means. If I don't, I end up in a bankruptcy court. Regrettably, the history of our Government has been that we have spent more than we have taken in and have run up deficits, and that is why the discipline is necessary. 
I think it is very useful to have the pendency of the balanced budget amendment, which has led many to say, `Well, we don't need the amendment. We can balance the budget without the amendment.' And if that provides an incentive to balance the budget without the amendment, that is all to the good. 
But even if we do balance the budget, and, so far, the signs are not very promising based upon what the President has submitted, it is fine. But the discipline is necessary in the long run, and that is why I support this amendment.

 Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the untimely death of Mr. Albert Shanker is a moment of great sadness for this Nation and for me personally. He lost his 3-year struggle with cancer Saturday evening on February 22, 1997. Since 1974, Mr. Shanker served as the president of the American Federation of Teachers. Prior to his election to that post, he was president of New York City's United Federation of Teachers, transforming it into one of the Nation's greatest unions. He was the first teacher to become a member of the AFL-CIO Executive Council and at his death, chaired the education committee and was chairman of the general board of its department for professional employees. 
Mr. Shanker was well known not only in this country, but also internationally and was the founding president of Education International, an organization with some 20 million teachers from democratic countries around the world. He also established American Federation of Teacher projects assisting teacher unions in South Africa, Chile, Poland, and Russia. 
Mr. Shanker was a driving force in the education reform movement and was well known for his column `Where We Stand' in the Sunday New York Times. He was also a leader in promoting civil and human rights. Several times over the last few months, as I prepared for Education hearings, I requested his participation, and even though his health kept him from appearing in person, his presence was always there--through his statements which he prepared and which were read by his designee. 
This Nation has lost a great leader, a great friend of education, and a great man. I send my regrets and my sympathy to his wife Edith and his children Adam, Jennie, Michael, and Carl.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss the pending unanimous-consent request on the tax measure. I do so because of my concern about a matter which is pressing for my State, in a number of particulars, most specifically the Wilkes-Barre arena, where financing is being held up because legislation has been introduced by Senator Moynihan, which has an effective date on the date of committee action, and bond counsel have, as I understand it, given an opinion that industrial development bonds cannot be issued from the State. 
After discussing the matter with Senator Moynihan, it is my understanding that he is concerned about the statutory limits on other tax-exempt bonds, which would affect hospitals and universities. It is a relative rarity that a tax bill comes through the Senate. This is an occasion where I would have an opportunity to introduce an amendment to try to move this process along. I am well aware of the fact that this is an important measure which needs to be cleared through the Senate. But I wanted to take this opportunity--and I have so advised our distinguished majority leader of my intention--when the unanimous-consent request is propounded, to reserve the right to object to see if we might get some sort of a schedule for consideration of the underlying issues here. 
I note the presence of the distinguished majority leader on the floor. I await his action on propounding the unanimous-consent request. I take advantage of this break in the action to state my position. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this resolution is being submitted on behalf of Senators Santorum, Feingold, Kohl, Jeffords, Leahy, Wellstone, Snowe, and Collins. 
It follows activity which Senator Santorum and I had undertaken in our State where the farmers have been very hard hit by low milk prices and rising costs of production, so that many, many farmers are near bankruptcy. 
It is my understanding that this is a national problem, not only a problem in Pennsylvania. On Monday of this week, Secretary 
of Agriculture Dan Glickman went to northeastern Pennsylvania and heard from a large assembly of farmers, estimated at some 500, and heard firsthand the plight of those farmers, again, as I say representative of the Nation. 
We all know that we rely upon the farmers for our supply of food. We know how important milk is in that supply. And we have a large group of farmers who laid it on the line in very emphatic and dramatic terms about their impending bankruptcy, the hard times they were facing because the price of milk had dropped so precipitously from $15.37 per hundredweight in September to $11.34 cents per hundredweight in December 1996, all the time costs going up. 
In our inquiry on this issue, we found that a key ingredient on the pricing of milk was the price of cheese, and that the price of cheese had been established by the Green Bay Cheese Exchange, and that the price on the Green Bay Cheese Exchange might not be realistic of the accurate market price. If the price of cheese is raised by 10 cents, it means there would be a rise in the price of milk $1 per hundredweight. 
I do believe that the Secretary of Agriculture is sympathetic to this issue and would like to ascertain the accurate price of cheese. 
It is my thought, Mr. President, from all that I know, and it has to be verified, that the price of cheese is priced unreasonably low at this time by the Green Bay Exchange; therefore, the Green Bay Exchange's price of cheese is really not the price of cheese. 
This resolution maintains that it is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Agriculture should consider acting immediately pursuant to his legal authority to modify the basic formula price for dairy by replacing the national cheese exchange as a factor to be considered in setting the basic formula price. 
This resolution has been filed pursuant to the leadership initiated by my colleague, Senator Santorum, who traveled to northeastern Pennsylvania several weeks ago. I went this past Monday. And I think it will put us on a track to show that something can be done immediately. When I say immediately, within the course of the next several weeks. 
It had been my hope that we might have been able to make some modification in the price of cheese to have even faster action by the Secretary of Agriculture. But considering the fact that this resolution was drafted on Monday morning and has gone through considerable analysis by a number of Members of the Senate--and I thank my colleagues for their prompt attention to this issue--we are moving now very, very rapidly. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, let me point out that there was an extensive study of the Green Bay Cheese Exchange made at the request of the Secretary of Agriculture of the State of Wisconsin, and there were some indications there that because of the limited amount of cheese which was traded there, there was an opportunity to have a price established which was not genuinely a market price. The amount of cheese traded at Green Bay was less than one-half of 1 percent, and where you have such a limited exchange rate and with people at the scene who have a considerable interest in having a lower price of cheese, that result may not have represented the accurate market price of cheese. 
The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority unilaterally to make a modification on the price of cheese if he develops an evidentiary base from other transactions which lead him to conclude that is not the fair market price of cheese, and I believe that to be the case. The Secretary of Agriculture had previously initiated the process on informal rulemaking, which would take some considerable period of time. But he does have the authority. 
If we may vote at this time, Mr. President, I will conclude.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a resolution along with 43 of my colleagues to designate March 25, 1977, as `Greek Independence Day: A Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.' 
The Greeks began the revolution 176 years ago, that would free them from the Ottoman Empire and return Greece to its democratic heritage. It was, of course, the ancient Greeks who developed the concept of democracy in which the supreme power to govern was vested in the people. Our Founding Fathers drew heavily upon the political and philosophical experience of ancient Greece in forming our representative democracy. Thomas Jefferson proclaimed that, `to the ancient Greeks * * * we are all indebted for the light which led ourselves our of Gothic darkness.' It is fitting, then, that we should recognize the anniversary of the beginning of their efforts to return to that democratic tradition. 
The democratic form of government is only one of the most obvious of the many benefits we have gained from the Greek people. The ancient Greeks contributed a great deal to the modern world, particularly to the United States of America, in the areas of art, philosophy, science, and law. Today, Greek-Americans continue to enrich our culture and make valuable contributions to American society, business, and government. 
It is my hope that strong support for this resolution in the Senate will serve as a clear goodwill gesture to the people of Greece with whom we have enjoyed such a close bond throughout history. Similar resolutions have been signed into law each of the past several years, with overwhelming support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Accordingly, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this important resolution.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak briefly on the issue of the pending nomination of Ms. Alexis M. Herman to be Secretary of Labor, and I urge that Ms. Herman be given a hearing on the subject so that there may be a determination, one way or the other, about her qualifications to be Secretary of Labor. 
I talked at some length to Alexis M. Herman yesterday. A request had been made by the White House for me to meet with her, perhaps in my capacity as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the Department of Labor. And I met with Ms. Herman in the context of a number of questions that have been raised about her qualifications to be Secretary of Labor. 
There has been an issue raised about her handling of her position as liaison for public matters in the Office of Public Liaison, as to whether there had been some activities that went over the line in political activities or fundraising. I questioned Ms. Herman about that at some length, although not in a dispositive form. But it seems to me that she is entitled to be heard on the subject and to have a decision made one way or the other about whether she is qualified or disqualified. 
I questioned her about the circumstances where there was a coffee, which had started out in her department, where she had issued an invitation to Mr. Gene Ludwig, who was Comptroller of the Currency, to a meeting with bankers, at a time when she thought it was going to be a substantive meeting and it would not involve fundraising. Later, she found out that there were individuals from the Democratic National Committee who were involved, and she then did not attend the meeting herself, but had not informed Mr. Ludwig about the nature of the meeting in order to withdraw the invitation to him. 
There have been other questions raised about the Anti-Deficiency Act, and perhaps other matters. But I think it is very important when someone is nominated for a position and there is public controversy and public comment, that that individual have his or her `day in court' to have a determination made as to whether she, or he, may be qualified to handle the position. 
I thought it was very unfortunate, when Prof. Lani Guinier was nominated for a key position, Assistant Attorney General in the Department of Justice, that her nomination was withdrawn without having an opportunity for her to be heard. At that time, I met with her and read her writings and I thought she was qualified. But I thought, surely, there should have been a determination by the committee. I recall the withdrawal of the nomination of Zoe Baird, who was up for Attorney General of the United States, and I recollect when Judge Ginsburg had been nominated for the Supreme Court; neither of them had finished their hearings. I think it is very important, in the context where we are trying to bring good people into Government and, inevitably, they are under a microscope, which is the way it is, and that is understandable. But they ought to have a chance to be heard and have their day in court and have a chance to defend themselves and have the public know what has gone on. If they pass, fine, and if they do not, so be it. But they ought to have that opportunity. 
I respected the decision made by Judge Bork back in 1987 when he wanted the matter to go forward and to come to a vote so that there would be a determination, because I think it is very unfortunate and unwise that when somebody allows their name to be put forward and you have these allegations in the newspapers about misconduct or impropriety, the impression is left with the public that that is, in fact, the conclusion, if the White House withdraws the name--as the White House did with Prof. Lani Guinier--or if the person doesn't move forward to a hearing. 
I talked to my colleague, Senator Jeffords, who chairs the Labor Committee, and Senator Jeffords has advised me that he is reviewing the outstanding questions, and the prospects are that there will be a hearing. But after meeting with Ms. Herman and having some say over her Department's activities in my capacity as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee, I did want to voice my sentiments on this subject to urge that her nomination go forward. I do not have a final view as to the merits, yes or no. But I think she is entitled to be heard. 
Aside from the allegations that have been made about her, she has a very distinguished record. She is a graduate of Xavier University and has worked in the public and private sectors. She has quite a distinguished record as a businesswoman, has served in the administration of President Carter, and has served in the current administration. She may well be qualified, or the contrary may be the case. But I think it ought to be heard so she can have a determination on the merits. I thank my colleagues, Senator Hatch and Senator Dodd, for allowing me this time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. I understand that. I want to make a comment or two about it, and then I will make that unanimous-consent request. 
Mr. President, this resolution relates to a very urgent problem on milk pricing in the country, but especially in Pennsylvania, where Senator Santorum and I have been working with our farmers to try to find something to grant some immediate relief. This is a problem which exists nationwide, and we believe that we have found a way to deal with this issue in the short run as it relates to the price of cheese, which is an ingredient in establishing the price of milk. 
Yesterday, Secretary of Agriculture Glickman accompanied me to northeastern Pennsylvania. We have found that the Secretary has the authority unilaterally to change the price of milk if there is a different price for cheese other than that which has been established by the National Cheese Exchange in Wisconsin. 
This is a matter of some urgency, Mr. President, which is why I have discussed with the leadership the prospect of offering this resolution at this time. 
I ask unanimous consent that this resolution be taken up on a 20-minute time limit, 10 minutes equally divided, with the yeas and nays on the vote. I submit this resolution on behalf of myself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Leahy.

It is my understanding that this is an issue which will not cause regional friction, as do so many issues on milk pricing. It is an adjustment on price which will benefit all regions.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the dairy farmers of northeastern Pennsylvania, and for that matter the entire State of Pennsylvania, and for that matter the entire Nation, are suffering very materially because of low milk prices. It is a national calamity, where dairy farmers all across the country are facing the prospect of bankruptcy because the costs of producing milk have risen so tremendously and the price of selling milk has decreased very rapidly in the course of the past several weeks and several months. 
Because of this emergency state, Senator Santorum and I and others on the Pennsylvania delegation and really others in the Congress have been taking a close look at what is happening on the pricing of milk. This morning, the Secretary of Agriculture, Daniel Glickman, accepted the invitation from Senator Santorum and I and others in the Pennsylvania delegation to travel to Keystone College, located on the outskirts of Scranton, PA, to meet with and to hear the concerns of farmers. We had a very large crowd, hundreds of people. I am reluctant to say quite how many until I read tomorrow morning's newspapers, perhaps as many as 1,000 farmers. 
At that time, we heard the economic plight of the farmers in very graphic and very emphatic terms. The highlight of the meeting occurred when a woman named Mrs. Swetter made the point, very, very emphatically, about the imminent difficulties faced by the farmers and how answers were needed now. This Mrs. Patricia Swetter made that point with special gusto, as did quite a number of the other farmers who spoke at the hearing. 
Secretary Glickman responded that there would be an effort made to do what was possible now but commented about the difficulties of an immediate solution. That prompted a discussion on one point which I think has the prospect of doing something immediately, and that is delinking the price established by the Cheese Exchange out of Green Bay, WI, and have the Secretary of Agriculture develop an equivalent price for cheese. 
Now, some may wonder why the talk of a price for cheese on the discussion of a price of milk. The reason is that the price of cheese is a very key component in establishing the price of milk. 
For every 10 cents on an increase in the price of cheese, the price of milk goes up $1 per hundredweight. There have been some indicators that the price of cheese is not accurate as it has been currently established. The Secretary responded in a dialog that a number of us had--the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Glickman, the farmers who were there, myself--that he would be willing to work now to develop an equivalent price of cheese, so that we could have a reevaluation as to the price of milk. There has been some indication that there has been some manipulation of the price of cheese. It may be that this is a subject which ought to be a matter for a hearing by the Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee. It may also be that there ought to be a hearing from the Agriculture Subcommittee of Appropriations, or from the Agriculture Committee, on the pricing of milk, taking a close look at the issue of developing an equivalent price for cheese. 
I intend, Mr. President, to submit to the Senate a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to urge and/or direct the Secretary of Agriculture to move promptly on this issue of the price of cheese, with a view to having some immediate modification on the price of milk. Secretary of Agriculture Glickman has stated his willingness to do so, recognizing the plight of the farmers but, obviously, requiring a sufficient evidentiary base to be able to make that modification. 
So we are in the process now--my staff and I started in mid-morning--to try to make the determination as to the price of cheese in America, because the price established by the so-called Green Bay Cheese Exchange is about one-half of 1 percent, and may well not--in fact, probably does not--reflect the price of cheese across the country. 
When we talk about helping the farmer, we talk about a great many items. We talk about increasing exports, which we are working on systematically, we talk about programs to increase cheese consumption at schools on programs purchased by the Federal Government. But the issue of milk pricing is something which requires our attention now. 
It is true that the Secretary of Agriculture has a second track to change the price of cheese under a procedure that calls for public hearings and inputs, but that doesn't eliminate the basic authority. The Secretary of Agriculture explained to me that he does have the power to go on a separate track and to unilaterally delete the price of cheese from the Cheese Exchange and to establish an equivalent price for cheese. That is a matter we are pursuing, and I think a sense-of-the-Senate resolution would be a very substantial impetus to move that process along. 
So I thank the Secretary for coming to northeastern Pennsylvania. He was up very, very early this morning. He had commitments back in Washington at noontime. I met him at the Scranton Airport shortly before 8 a.m. this morning. So it was an early start for him and for the rest of us and for all the farmers who appeared there. But I do think something material can be done to assist the farmers on this very important issue of milk pricing.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in favor of the balanced budget amendment. 
Mr. President, this amendment has come up repeatedly during my tenure in the U.S. Senate, and I have consistently supported the balanced budget amendment because of my deep-seated view that the Congress needs this discipline if we are to balance the budget on a permanent basis. It is a very fundamental principle that people ought to live within their means--if you or I do not, we end up in the bankruptcy court--and that governmental entities must live within their means. The only exception to this issue of living within one's means has been the Government of the United States of America, which goes into further debt each year with deficits of $100 billion or $200 billion, or more, establishing a national debt in excess of $5 trillion. 
This issue came into sharp focus for me recently when my wife and I were blessed with two grandchildren. We would certainly never think of imposing our financial obligations on our grandchildren, or spending money on their credit cards for them to pay at some later date. But that is precisely what we have done as a society. We have undertaken a variety of methods to try to move toward a balanced budget with Gramm-Rudman and the so-called automatic sequestrations. That did not work. Nothing has worked, which is why I believe, in the final analysis, we need to move to the balanced budget amendment. 
We had the vote last year, coming within one vote of having the amendment pass. The President is opposed to the balanced budget amendment. But I do believe that just the pendency of the amendment has been a very substantial impetus moving the administration, the President, and the Congress to balance the budget without a constitutional amendment. 
President Clinton has laid before the Congress and the country what he submits is a plan to balance the budget by the year 2002. But the reality is, upon looking at the fine print, that it is unlikely to achieve that result because most of the cuts are in the last 2 years. When we come to that point, there is the inevitable impetus to eliminate those cuts. But to the extent that the pendency of the balanced budget amendment will move us to balance the budget without an amendment, that is so much to the good. Ideally, it would be preferable if we could balance the budget without having a constitutional amendment. But regrettably, that has not been our experience. 
It is always difficult to turn down worthwhile programs for Federal Governmental expenditures, and it is very, very difficult, painful, and really, at the present time, impossible to have tax increases with a Congress that is controlled by the Republicans and, I think, properly declining to even entertain tax increases. So when we do have the mandate of a balanced budget, it is apparent to everyone--it is apparent to all 535 Members of Congress, and it is apparent to our constituents. How frequently have we all heard the cry or the comment of a constituent coming to see us, `I have a very important program that is meritorious and ought to be financed,' and, at the same time, insisting that the taxes not go up and that the budget be balanced? 
I think it is important, Mr. President, as we go over this balanced budget amendment, that we allow sufficient flexibility for our Government to respond in times of crises or emergency. I share the concern that the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, has expressed in offering his amendment. But I think that the underlying resolution covers the problem in the appropriate way by calling for a supermajority, or 60 votes, in order to waive the provisions of the balanced budget in the event that there is a recession, an economic crisis, which requires that. Therefore, I intend to vote against the Durbin amendment. 
There has been very considerable comment about whether Social Security ought to be excluded from the balanced budget amendment. After very considerable thought, Mr. President, it is my conclusion that Social Security should be excluded. I say that notwithstanding my recognition of the problems there will be to balance the budget now if we exclude Social Security. But I submit that it is an artificial way of balancing the budget, which says that we ought to make expenditures which are not in excess of our income if we include Social Security, because those funds really are a trust fund to pay Social Security recipients at a later day. So what we are doing is saying we are going to spend more money, which we really can't afford now, by invading the trust fund, and we will put off for tomorrow what we are not willing to face up to today, to find a way to pay the Social Security recipients when the due date arises. 
We know very well that the so-called baby boomers will present a charge on the Social Security trust fund at a later date--2020--which we will be unable to pay unless we find some way to raise taxes or some way to make other cuts which are unrealistic in the context of what we might expect at that time. It may be that in crafting a balanced budget amendment, excluding Social Security, we will have to implement it on a schedule which is realistic which will account for excluding those surplus funds at the present time. But when we talked about Social Security initially we were talking about an insurance fund concept. We were talking about setting aside the money in a way where it would be there to pay those benefits at the time when one reached the age for Social Security. 
So that it is my very, very strong view that as a matter of sound financing that Social Security ought to be excluded. And this body has responded on many occasions when that issue has been presented. My late colleague, Senator John Heinz, was one of the major exponents for taking Social Security offbudget--not the only exponent but I recall the eloquent speeches which he made. And I recall many sense-of-the-Senate resolutions where we talked about putting Social Security offbudget because it is a trust fund. 
I remember well during the tenure of James Baker, the Secretary of the Treasury, when there was an unusual invasion of the trust fund. I took the floor at that time and made a comment that there was really a fraudulent conversion which I believed was the case, and have analogized it to my experience as district attorney of Philadelphia when there was a trust fund and a fraudulent conversion. The people who took the money out of that trust fund were guilty of a criminal offense because, if it is set aside for a specific purpose and the trustee invades the fund for some purpose other than for which it was intended, that is a conversion and an invasion. 
So while I believe very strongly that we ought to have a balanced budget amendment, I think if it is to be realistic and not a double set of books that Social Security ought to be kept offbudget. 
Mr. President, I think that in constructing a timetable for a balanced budget amendment it is entirely possible to accommodate to the lesser amount of income which we have from Social Security payments in order to see to it that our current income aside from Social Security payments matches our current expenses, and that is the only way to truly have a balanced budget which I think we ought to have. And an amendment is the way to impose the discipline to be sure we will have it for the future. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to pay tribute to a very distinguished citizen of the world, Pamela Churchill Harriman, whose untimely death occurred yesterday in Paris, France, while she was performing her very distinguished duties as United States Ambassador to France. 
Ambassador Harriman had an illustrious career. She has graced Europe, she has graced the United States, and has capped an extraordinary life with very distinguished service for the past 4 years as our Ambassador to France, dealing, in fact, with some of the most difficult problems of the world, as we have tensions between the United States and France and the problems of NATO and a great many other issues. 
During the past several years, I have had the privilege to come to know Ambassador Harriman personally. I traveled to Paris in connection with my duties as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and found her knowledge, experience, and wisdom in that field to be very extensive and, candidly, it was somewhat of a surprise to find such depth and knowledge and understanding on the complicated matters which involve intelligence. 
She truly had an extraordinary life. Married to Randolph Churchill, the son of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, she was privy to some of the really fascinating and great events of the era. 
During the course of conversations with her, I was struck to hear her tell of being at Checkers, the home of the Prime Minister, one Sunday evening when the dinner was interrupted by a telephone call from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And she told the story about Prime Minister Winston Churchill telling the story of President Roosevelt telling to Churchill the United States was now in it with Great Britain, because the attack on Pearl Harbor had just occurred. 
And then her reminiscences about the events during the war. The Churchills had a basement at No. 10 Downing Street for when the air raids came on. They had tiered bunkers. They were not set up in very elaborate fashion. She slept in the lower bunk, pregnant at the time, and Sir Winston Churchill would come in, she recounted, at 2 a.m. and snore loudly, awakening everybody in the compound. 
When I heard of the news 2 days ago, I called Charge d'Affaires Donald Bandler to find out what her condition was. She finished an arduous day, was on her way for a swim in the Ritz Hotel and, before going into the water, had suffered a seizure. 
I had a chance to talk briefly with her son, Winston Churchill, who said at that point it was apparent that his mother would not survive. 
While talking with her about the events of being an ambassador, I was struck with the difficulties that Ambassadors of the United States are having around the world and took some of the information and made a statement on the Senate floor praising the work she was doing, illustrative of ambassadors generally, commenting about the need to support the State Department and the activities which ambassadors were performing. 
While there, I had an opportunity to stay in the Benjamin Franklin Room, a room of special significance to this Senator, Franklin being a Philadelphian really, not a Bostonian, and had an opportunity to get some of the memorabilia from the Ben Franklin Institute to send to Ambassador Harriman to furnish the Franklin Room in the style she wanted it to be. 
We have lost a really great world citizen with the passing of Ambassador Harriman. There is much more that could be said about her, in terms of her illustrious life. Many Senators knew her; most of Washington knew her. She was a great citizen of Great Britain, she was, in a sense, a citizen of France but, most of all, a great citizen of America. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support the pending resolution because it focuses attention on the need for mammograms that would give the imprimatur of the U.S. Senate to this important medical testing device. I, with many other Americans, was very surprised when, on January 23, a report was issued questioning the advisability of mammograms with the essential finding that there was not enough evidence that women in their forties would benefit by advising them to have the x-ray test as part of routine health screening. The question which then came to my mind was whether there was enough evidence to conclude that women in their forties would not benefit from the mammograms as part of routine health screening. 
To articulate the conclusion in the form that there was not sufficient evidence to show that women would benefit is really not to answer the question, because where the evidence may be in doubt in the minds of some scientists, the practical sense conclusion is that there is very, very substantial evidence to show that mammograms are helpful and that underlying a decision not to have mammography is a question about cost-benefit ratio and a question about certain collateral issues, which need not necessarily be faced, as to whether there will be unnecessary biopsies. 
This matter struck home with me especially, because in 1993, when I sought an MRI examination of my head, I was told by the doctors that I did not need it. I then insisted on having it, and they found a potentially life-threatening problem, which was corrected after I got the MRI. There is an attitude in many quarters that unless the burden of proof rises to a certain level, and perhaps a very high level, these tests ought not to be given. I think that is the wrong standard of evaluation. 
Mammograms are expensive; MRI's are expensive. But I am convinced, from the work I have done as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, that we have enough mammography equipment and enough specialists and enough administrators and enough MRI machines, et cetera, to conduct the necessary tests. It may be necessary to do them in the evening. If an MRI costs $800 at a convenient time during the day, maybe it could be accomplished at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. for $50, 
with a margin of cost as to what it would take. 
When this report came down on January 23, 12 days ago, I immediately scheduled a hearing of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services. Tomorrow we will be hearing from the people who came to the conclusion that mammograms are not warranted for women in their forties, and we will also be hearing from people who have reached the opposite conclusion. 
I think it is very significant that Dr. Richard D. Klausner, Director of the National Cancer Institute, expressed shock when he heard of this report that mammograms were not warranted for women in their forties. 
Dr. Bernadine Healy, former Director of NIH, made this succinct statement: `What are they saying--that ignorance is bliss?' 
Dr. Daniel B. Kopans of the Harvard Medical School said the committee's report was `fraudulent,' which was the way he termed it. 
And if you take a look at this issue historically, in 1977, the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society recommended that women 40 to 49 have mammograms only if their mothers or sisters had breast cancer. In 1980, the Cancer Society recommended that one-time mammograms for women 35 to 40 were warranted to establish a baseline for future measurements for women under 50. In 1983, the Cancer Society recommended that symptom-free women 40 to 49 have mammograms every 1 or 2 years. 
In 1987, the Cancer Institute adopted a working guideline to begin screening women age 40 with mammograms every 1 to 2 years. In 1989, those guidelines were officially adopted by a conference of leading cancer organizations. 
Then, in 1993, the National Cancer Institute changed the recommendation, saying `Experts do not agree on the value of routine screening of mammography of women ages 40 to 49.' They do not agree that women in that age category ought not to have mammograms. And I say on the face of this record with succinct evidence that women do benefit from mammograms. Even though there is conflicting evidence, we ought to err on the side of safety, and mammograms ought to be available. 
But when there is a national report questioning the value for women 40 to 49, immediately it is going to send shock waves to the women of America who will say, `Well, maybe I do not really need a mammogram.' 
It is very difficult to get some people to take medical tests because people very understandably, very naturally, are afraid of the results. If you have this conclusion from a group of experts that you really ought not to have it, that it is not a matter of necessity, then women are not going to take it. Where you have this kind of report too, those who are responsible for paying for mammograms are going to have a good reason to say, `We are not going to cover mammograms for women in the 40 to 49 category.' 
When we have the hearing in the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services tomorrow it will be a rather unusual hearing as far as I am concerned. Most of the time we have these hearings to answer questions. This is one hearing that I am approaching with the fixed opinion from all that I have studied in the past to really find a direction so that the National Cancer Institute will take whatever steps are necessary to resolve this issue in favor of having mammograms. It is simply not sufficient to say on the evidence that when there is conflicting evidence we are going to reject mammograms for women in the 40 to 49 age category. 
In addition, I think that the National Cancer Institute ought to be doing more on multiinstitutional testing of MRI's on imaging. Last year, with the help of the Central Intelligence Agency and a special contribution made with the help of then-Director John Deutch, some $2 million was put up by the CIA for imaging processes on the proposition that if the CIA could image and detect through clouds and look to the Earth to find out what was going on that 
those processes could be helpful in the detection of breast cancer. 
So I compliment my distinguished colleague from Maine and my distinguished colleague from Maryland for their leadership. 
I would like to add that for the National Institutes of Health budget, specific research funding for women was added that Senator Harkin, then-chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, and I as ranking member, supported. I must say that I like it better to be chairman and have Senator Harkin as ranking member. But there has been very considerable attention to this issue not only by our very distinguished women Senators but many on the male side as well. 
I hope that the vote this afternoon--and I am confident that it will be, knowing our colleagues on issues of this sort--will be a resounding vote to send a message to the women of America that they ought to get mammograms, that they ought to protect their health, and that where it is an open question as to whether it is cost-effective, let us err on the side of taking the test. 
I say that with some substantial experience in the field of having undergone a test that the experts said I didn't need, which for me was a life-saving procedure. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to address an ongoing threat to our Nation's security and prosperity, a threat with dual roots. In the precarious Middle East and right here at home there is reason for concern about our Nation's increased reliance on potentially unstable foreign sources of oil. I believe it is critical during the 105th Congress that we focus on efforts to increase energy conservation, particularly in the context of reauthorization of the Federal highway and transit programs. 
We must think back to the days of the gulf war and further back to the oil crises of the 1970's to better understand the entire picture. American consumers too often forget the interdependence of world events, particularly when it comes to our use of imported foreign oil. There are currently legitimate reasons to question whether instability in the Mideast will once again jeopardize our access to that region's oil resources, putting our economy and perhaps our national security at significant risk. 
By way of background, it is well known that the oil supplies in the Mideast are immense. An estimated 66 percent of the world's recoverable oil resources are found in the region. These supplies are critical to the United States as well as to our European allies. More than 20 percent of the oil we purchase comes from the Arab countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly known as OPEC. Western Europe depends on the region for 25 percent of its oil consumption. These OPEC countries include alphabetically, Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. 
I have been troubled that U.S. imports of foreign oil continue to increase. Currently, the U.S. imports constitute more than 50 percent of the oil which we consume. According to the American Petroleum Institute, this equals more than 9 million barrels per day, with a 6-percent increase in the amount of imported oil since 1995 alone. That is cause for real concern. This is a huge jump from the 6 million barrels imported per day in 1973. Further, if these trends continue, analysts say that in 10 years we will look to these overseas sources for two-thirds of our energy needs. 
In part because of the ready availability of less expensive sources of foreign oil, it has not been cost effective for U.S. energy companies to increase domestic production. U.S. domestic production of oil continues to decline, with an estimated 17,000 U.S. oil wells ceasing production annually. U.S. industry claims that regulatory relief and tax measures are necessary to jump start domestic production again, and these are areas which we ought to consider. 
This is a field that I have some personal knowledge in, Mr. President, from my roots in Kansas where my father ran a junkyard and where he and my brothers bought oil wells for salvage and then flooded wells. We have a great source of supply from those wells and other production in the United States which we really ought to reexamine in the context of this major international problem. 
In an effort to protect ourselves against the disruption of oil supplies after the oil crises we faced in the 1970's, Congress established the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That reserve was intended to minimize the effects of any disruptions from the import of oil, and by the end of 1989 that reserve held 580 million barrels. The first sale from that reserve occurred after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, demonstrating that the reserve can serve its intended purpose, because it was used at that time. 
The effectiveness of the reserve is measured by the number of days of net petroleum imports the reserve could supply in the event of an interruption in the supply of foreign oil. For example, in 
1986 the reserve was said to contain 115 days of imports. By 1995, based on the decreasing U.S. production and a corresponding increase in foreign imports, the reserve was said to hold an amount comparable to 75 days of net imports. 
As if it was not sufficient to let the effectiveness of the reserve dwindle, last year in an unprecedented move, the Administration decided to sell approximately 25 million barrels of petroleum from the reserve to generate revenues, an amount equivalent to almost 3 weeks supply of imports from Saudi Arabia. That timing, I suggest, was less than prudent, particularly considering the state of affairs in the Mideast today which should highlight the dangers and disadvantages of reliance on Mideast oil. Saudi Arabia, in particular, poses a unique cause for concern. The sovereign independence of Saudi Arabia is of vital interest to the United States, as President Bush said in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait. If a hostile nation seized Saudi oil wells, the largest reserve in the world, the American economy and the world markets could tumble. 
More recent events are again drawing our attention to Saudi Arabia. Last week, Attorney General Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh publicly acknowledged what has been known for a long time; and that is that the Saudis are not cooperating with the United States investigation into the terrible terrorist attack at Dharhan on June 25 of 1996. We saw the terrorist attack on United States citizens in Riyadh in November of 1995. We saw the Saudi investigation. We saw the Saudi execution of four convicts, people they said were guilty, on May 31, 1996 without giving the FBI an opportunity to question those individuals. Now Director Freeh has been blunt about the lack of Saudi cooperation, and Attorney General Janet Reno said the same thing in public disclosures last week. 
It is in the interest of the United States, Mr. President, for our relationship with Saudi Arabia to continue, and we want to have a good relationship with the Saudis. But we have some 5,000 U.S. military personnel there. We have thousands of other U.S. personnel there. I think it is important for the Saudis to understand that continued United States cooperation requires fair treatment for our investigative efforts. 
Along a parallel line, it is important for the Saudis to understand that respect for United States personnel there, for their religious freedom, is of enormous importance. It was not too long ago, in the mid 1980's, when United States citizens were arrested in their households by the so-called `religious police' and held in detention. 
But this effort to maintain our relationship with the Saudis, while of enormous importance, requires that we focus on a potential problem of what we will do if the oil supplies from Saudi Arabia are in any way threatened. 
Mr. President, while our interest in reducing dependence on foreign oil is a difficult task, we can achieve meaningful reductions in energy consumption through prompt reauthorization of the Federal mass transit and highway programs contained in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, known as ISTEA, as well as enactment of an Amtrak reform bill and continued public policy initiatives to promote the use of clean burning alternative-fueled vehicles such as natural gas and electric cars. 
ISTEA is commonly referred to as the highway bill, but it does much more than pave roads. That legislation expands the mass transit formula and discretionary grant programs, authorizing some $31.5 billion over 6 years for public transportation. Other provisions established funding for bicycle paths and pedestrian walkways. That bill revolutionized Federal spending on transportation infrastructure improvements by establishing the National Highway System, funding the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, granting States and local governments more flexibility in determining transit and highway solutions, and promoting new technologies such as intelligent transportation systems and magnetic levitation systems, which are also important alternatives to help us reduce dependency on foreign oil. 
The funding authority for ISTEA will expire on September 30 this year, therefore creating the necessity and an opportunity to focus national attention on the significant link between energy consumption and our transportation infrastructure. A Department of Transportation study of the 50 largest urban areas in the United States suggests that nearly 4 billion gallons of gasoline are wasted each year due to traffic congestion--approximately 94 million barrels of oil. There is much at stake, for the annual economic loss to business in the United States caused by traffic congestion is estimated in itself at $40 billion by the Federal Transit Administration. We will be correcting many problems if we work on mass transit and road improvements to reduce traffic congestion and also our dependence on foreign oil. 
Legislation to reauthorize Federal highway programs will provide an opportunity to improve existing roadways, construct more efficient bypasses and highway interchanges and generally reduce congestion in our cities and towns. Further, a key weapon in our effort to reduce our dependence on oil shipments from potentially unstable regions is public transportation and mass transit. 
Mass transit has developed to include traditional bus and subway lines, commuter rail, cable cars, monorails, water taxis, and several other modes of shared transportation. Public transportation is a lifeline for millions of Americans and deserves substantial funding for that reason alone. However, it deserves even greater funding when one considers that public transportation saves 1.5 billion gallons of fuel consumption annually in the United States and that each commuter who switches from driving alone to using public transportation saves 200 gallons of gasoline per year, according to government and private studies. Transit thus deserves a renewed and expanded Federal commitment as we begin consideration of the reauthorization of ISTEA. 
The additional benefits of reducing fuel consumption and improving the environment, not to mention the millions of Americans who are involved in the transit industry, provide extra reason to stop and explore the case for mass transit. In our States, citizens and communities depend on good public transportation for mobility, access to jobs and health care providers, environmental control, and economic stability. 
In the context of ISTEA reauthorization, I intend to work closely with my colleagues to ensure that sufficient funds are available for improving our transportation infrastructure, including both highways and transit. As a first step, I was pleased to join 56 of my colleagues in a recent bipartisan letter to Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici urging that the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution reflect the need for increased transportation funding. Further, I am currently working on legislation that reflects the energy and environmental benefits of public transportation by increasing funding for mass transit and preserving the elements of the transit program incorporated in the 1991 ISTEA law. The additional benefits of reducing fuel consumption and improving the environment will be present if we do have the highway-transit conservation ideas uppermost in our minds. Mr. President, I have taken some time today since we are in morning business and since there is not business at hand to speak on the subject of the interrelationship between the way we handle mass transit and oil conservation in the context of what is going on in the Mideast and very serious potential problems which we face there. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in the New York Times from last Sunday be printed at the conclusion of my comments, entitled `Oil Imports Are Up. Fretting About It Is Down,' which summarizes some of the statistical basis for legitimate concern if we do not do something about those oil imports and if we do not focus on them. As the headline notes, fretting about oil imports is down. It is passe. We do remember those long lines, many of us do, in 1973, and we do see the problems in the Mideast and the issue of stability of the Saudi Government. 
This is the interrelation of problems which I think we have to address in a number of ways. We can address these problems through our foreign policy with the Saudis, and by trying to reduce dependency on foreign oil in a variety of ways, such as first, stimulating our domestic oil production consistent with environmental concerns, and second, reauthorizing the ISTEA programs, which will give us an opportunity to achieve some meaningful economies through mass transit.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Honorable William S. Cohen was a great Senator and I am confident that he will carry on his outstanding record in public service as Secretary of Defense. 
I compliment President Clinton both for his bipartisanship for nominating Bill Cohen and for his wisdom in selecting this man of unique ability and integrity. 
I have worked closely with Bill Cohen for the past 16 years and have found him to be brilliant, tenacious, honest, and hardworking. If Bill Cohen finds all the others in a Cabinet meeting about to make an erroneous decision, I am confident he will be smart enough and strong enough to persuade them to the correct course. 
I look forward to working with Secretary Cohen on many matters in the future.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I was pleased to support yesterday as an original cosponsor Senate Resolution 15 which proposes to double appropriations for medical research over the next 5 years. That is a lofty goal. I subscribe to that goal. 
During my tenure in the U.S. Senate I have served on the Appropriations Committee and on the subcommittee which has jurisdiction over the Department of Health and Human Services and the funding responsibility for the National Institutes of Health. 
I am pleased to note that, notwithstanding very severe budget constraints over the years, the subcommittee has consistently raised the funding, whether it was Senator Weicker, Senator Chiles, or Senator Harkin, or under my stewardship as chairman. 
When I joined the committee in 1981 the appropriations were $3.6 billion. That has now risen to $12.7 billion. Since I became chairman in 1996 we raised the funding by 5.7 percent, and in 1997, fiscal year 1997, 6.9 percent, some $820 million to a total now of $12.7 billion dollars. When the resolution calls for doubling NIH spending within 5 years, that is a very, very tough goal and a very, very tough objective to me. That would really call for an increase of expenditures of about $2.5 billion a year. My own view is that it would be a priority worth meeting to reach the goal of $2.5 billion a year if the allocation to the subcommittee did permit that. But I have grave doubts that will be possible, although it is as I say a lofty goal. 
We do need more grants in that field. There are some 27,000 grants now in operation. But only a fraction of the applications receive the grants, and there are many worthwhile grants that ought to be accepted. 
There have been tremendous advances in breast cancer and prostate cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, and many, many more. 
What I want to say today and do say is that as chairman of the subcommittee I am prepared to commit to an increase in the next year's budget of 7.5 percent, which would amount to some $950 million. 
In making that statement, I want to emphasize how difficult it will be to reach $950 million and a 7.5-percent commitment. But in articulating, stating that view, that is a strong stretch, considering the funding and the allocation which is present for the subcommittee which I chair. So I invite my colleagues to look toward alternative methods of financing if we are to be able to meet the $2.5 billion mark, which we really ought to do. But I did want to make a statement today, following the introduction of the resolution yesterday, that there is the commitment that I am prepared to undertake the 7.5-percent figure or $950 million.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as has always been my practice on return home from official travels overseas, I have sought recognition today to record for the information of our colleagues and my constituents in Pennsylvania the results of my recess trip, from November 16 to November 24, to the North Atlantic Assembly and to the Middle East. 
As you know, the Senate delegation in November 1996 to the North Atlantic Assembly included 13 Senators during all or part of a full schedule of meetings in Paris and London, arranged and ably chaired by Senator Roth. Let me take a moment to note here the important news of Senator Roth's election as the President of the North Atlantic Assembly. 
Our delegation's mission began with a working flight to Paris early in the morning on Saturday, November 16. As the presiding officer knows how rare it is for eight Senators to share 7 1/2 hours together--especially in the absence of a telephone--I know you can appreciate the value of this group of colleagues being able to exchange views and form plans relevant to the 105th Congress. 
In Paris and, later in the week, in London, our Senate North American Assembly Delegation focused its work on the vital--but vexing--questions of the purposes, the structures and the problems of transatlantic relations in the post cold war era. 
NATO has been perhaps the most successful international collective security arrangement in the world's history, ultimately achieving its once thought unattainable goal of containing and outlasting the empire of the former Soviet Union through a vigilant deterrence rather than actual conflict. It was this successful because it is more than a mutual defense pact. It is the coming together, across the Atlantic, of the power of the ideas of freedom and democracy. But NATO's very success in achieving its original aim is the basis of the present quandary of the alliance. In the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, we must ask for many reasons--including our responsibility to wisely spend the American taxpayers' dollars--what is NATO for now, what countries should be a part of the alliance and what roles and burdens should be played and borne by the different members of the North Atlantic community. 
Our Senate delegation took up these questions--and many subordinate ones as well, including the allied operation in Bosnia and trade and economic relations across the Atlantic--with our European parliamentary colleagues, senior officials of the executives of France, Britain, and other allied nations, international business leaders and, of course, our American Ambassadors and their staffs. 
Apart from the formal itinerary of the entire delegation, I made a point to visit with Alan J. Blinken, the America Ambassador in Brussels, headquarters of the European Economic Community, to discuss the transatlantic trade situation and other matters, and to engage in substantive conversations with our Ambassador to France, Pamela Harriman, concerning a variety of security and international economic issues. 
At mid-week, specifically, from Tuesday, November 19 through Thursday, November 21, I split off from my North American Assembly colleagues for an individual visit to the Middle East. 
As the presiding officer is well aware, I have reported to the Senate and my constituents many times on my visits to the Middle East, visits I began making in 1964, some 16 years prior to my election to the Senate. As a Senator, I have traveled extensively in this vital, but deeply troubled, part of the world in order to better fulfill my responsibilities as a member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of Appropriations--where I have been a member since coming to the Senate--and my roles as chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism and as chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, as well as my general duties as a Senator to be informed on a part of the world frequently requiring action by this body. 
This past August, the first visit to the Middle East I had made since the Israeli elections of May 1996, my trip became something more than a fact-finding assessment of the always changing situation in that part of the world when Prime Minister Netanyahu asked me to carry a message to Syrian President Assad concerning the Prime Minister's views on the reopening of peace talks between Israel and Syria and, in an even more time-sensitive vein, on Israeli thinking regarding Syrian troop movements occurring at that time in Lebanon and in areas of Syria near the Israeli controlled Golan Heights. 
As I stated on the floor upon my return at that time, I carried Prime Minister Netanyahu's messages to President Assad in Damascus and, following a substantive 3-hour exchange with the Syrian leader--with whom I have been meeting regularly since 1988--I returned to Israel to brief Prime Minister Netanyahu on President Assad's responses to the messages. 
In preparation for my joining the North Atlantic Assembly Delegation visit to Europe--because I would be half-way there, so to speak--I met here in Washington with the Syrian Ambassador to the United States, Walid Al-Moualem, to get an update from his perspective on the situation between Syria and Israel. Ambassador Al-Moualem told me that his government viewed my August round of talks between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Assad as having been helpful in deescalating the dangerous tensions, especially related to troop movements, between Israel and Syria and the Ambassador encouraged me to return to the region for another round of meetings aimed at helping the parties find a basis to reopen their peace negotiations. 
Now, I do not know if the Ambassador is correct in his characterization of my August meetings as helpful in reducing military tensions, but I told him that I obviously would make myself available to be helpful--without seeking either to displace the President or his representatives in this matter and without seeking to advance any personal agenda on the substance of an Israeli-Syrian peace--if both sides had an interest in my so doing. 
When consultations with Israeli officials, including a telephone conversation I had directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu, indicated a similar encouragement for me to make another visit to Israel and Syria as had been expressed by the Syrian Ambassador, I decided to make such a trip during a portion of the North Atlantic Assembly Delegation program in Europe. 
Naturally, and any press accounts at the time to the contrary notwithstanding, I and my staff both informed the State Department about my planned trip and received extensive briefings by relevant administration officials as to the Israeli/Syrian situation and administration policy on the matter. 
Mr. President, as you know, this sort of active involvement in foreign policy issues is, while--as I have already said--not meant to supplant the President, the Secretary of State or their representatives, a time-honored role for Members of the U.S. Senate, going back to such distinguished Senators as Arthur Vandenburg and William Fulbright. In any case, one could not responsibly pass up even a slight chance of being helpful in promoting peace between Israel and Syria when the alternative to peace could threaten dire consequences for us all. 
I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu at 8 a.m. on Wednesday, November 20 at his office in the Israeli Knesset Building. United States Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk was present. The Prime Minister told me that tensions with Syria have been reduced since the August/September time period and that he wants to continue to de-escalate the saber-rattling. He asked me to convey this, and specifically that Israel has no aggressive intent against Syria, when I went on to see President Assad that afternoon. He noted as an exception to the reduction of military dangers attacks on Israeli forces in southern Lebanon by Hezbollah and asked me to convey his request to President Assad that Syria seek to stop the Hezbollah attacks. 
On the broader issue of reopening peace talks with Syria, Prime Minister Netanyahu told me to tell President Assad that he wishes to do so as soon as possible and that he is ready, willing, and able to be personally involved in such talks. He said that although there are clearly tough issues to be addressed in negotiating with Syria, he has a real sense that talks could be productive. Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated that any talks with Syria will be based on the framework for Arab/Israel peace established by U.N. resolutions 242 and 338 and by the terms of reference of the 1991 Middle East peace conference organized by President Bush in Madrid. The Prime Minister's willingness to state the basis of talks with Syria in this way is significant because it indicates an acceptance that such talks would be based on the formula standardly called `land for peace.' 
The Prime Minister held his ground, however, on what has been the Syrian demand that new talks begin where the old talks left off, that is that Prime Minister Netanyahu's government be bound as a condition for reopening talks by what the Syrians consider a commitment by the prior Israel governments of Prime Ministers Rabin and Peres to full withdrawal by Israel from the Golan Heights to the June 4, 1967 line. He stated that he would not and could not agree to talks with such a precondition. 
I flew on to Damascus that day and held a wide ranging, cordial but frank 3-hour meeting with President Assad, lasting from 1:20 p.m. to 4:20 p.m. Syrian Foreign Minister Sharra and United States Ambassador to Syria, Christopher Ross, were also present. 
I raised with President Assad the mounting evidence of Iranian and perhaps Syrian involvement in or connection to the dastardly act of terrorist murder against United States soldiers at Khobar Towers in Dharhan, in Saudi Arabia, on June 15, 1996. I reminded President Assad that the United States had responded militarily against Libya in 1986 when we received proof of Libyan responsibility for a bombing at a nightclub in Germany which killed two American servicemen. 
Our exchange on this subject was pointed but it was incumbent on me to take this opportunity of a face-to-face session at this time to reiterate that the United States cannot be targeted by terrorists with impunity. 
On the central purpose of the meeting, I regret to say I can report little progress, frankly less than I had hoped based on the encouragement I had received to make this visit and on public statements by the Syrian Foreign Minister about the possibility of renewing talks with Israel. 
President Assad did generally seem to share Prime Minister Netanyahu's desire to continue to ease and avoid military tensions which could lead to unintended hostilities. Although he denied having the ability to control Hezbollah activities in Lebanon, President Assad received this portion of Prime Minister Netanyahu's message positively and reiterated his own return message to the same effect. President Assad's position was unmovable, however, regarding the terms for the reopening of talks with Israel. 
The Syrian leader asserts with complete conviction that he will not restart talks without a prior reaffirmation by Israel of the pledge he says he received from the prior Israeli governments, and ratified in his view by the United States as participants in the talks, for full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. In his view the next round of talks are only properly about the details of security arrangements along the new border and the process of normalization between the countries, not on the territorial question itself. This is not a `precondition' for future talks, he argues, because Syria already obtained this commitment from Israel and the United States in the prior talks and that commitment binds Israel despite its change of government. 
I attempted to argue to President Assad that in any negotiation such as that between Syria and Israel, nothing is final until everything is final, and that in the absence of any signed document binding Israel as a state, the new Israeli government was not obligated by the negotiating position of a former administration. I also argued that Prime Minister Netanyahu's public comments accepting the land for peace framework for talks with Syria should be a sufficient basis to get back to the table and see what happens in that very different dynamic. I tried many formulations of these ideas but he would have none of it. 
I returned to Israel that evening and met again with Prime Minister Netanyahu, to brief him on my talks with President Assad, on the following morning, Thursday, November 21, 1996. 
While there is certainly a very sharp divide between the Israeli and Syrian leaders on the basis for a reopening of peace talks, I continue to believe that such a return to the negotiating table is not only essential, but possible if the American involvement in this process is taken to a new level. I came away from this round of meetings convinced that the logjam might be broken, but only with direct action by the President of the United States. 
The United States has been more than an observer or facilitator of the Israeli/Syrian peace process so far. We have been an indispensable party, viewed by both sides as the guarantor of the integrity of both the negotiating process and of any final outcome which might be achieved. If the different accounts of where the last round of talks left off and what that means for future talks are to be resolved, it will happen only with the most active American role at the highest level. 
Since my return, I have discussed with the President's National Security advisor--and CIA Director designee--Anthony Lake, and his Special Mid-East Envoy, Dennis Ross, and I intend to discuss with the President directly, my suggestion that President Clinton invite President Assad--who has never been to this country--and Prime Minister Netanyahu to a meeting in the Oval Office--not to conclude a final peace treaty at this time but simply to find a formula for the reopening of talks between their countries. 
While nothing is ever certain in such a difficult situation, I believe it would be productive for the President to raise the stakes of the peace process between Israel and Syria--as an Oval Office invitation would surely do--because the stakes of a continued state of war between these two countries remain so high. 
Mr. President, we must all continue to do all we can to find the path to a just and secure peace in the Middle East.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today principally to lend my support to the nomination of the Honorable Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State. 
It is a historic and fitting occasion that this will be the first vote in the U.S. Senate in the 105th Congress. I have come to know Ambassador Albright in her work at the United Nations, and have a very high regard for her competency. And I am pleased that the President has made this historic appointment because she is the first woman who will have this very important position. 
She has an extraordinary record in academia: president of the Center for National Policy; a professor of international affairs at Georgetown University; a senior fellow in Soviet and Eastern European affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies; served on the National Security Council staff; has excellent academic credentials from Wellesley; also a masters and doctorate from Columbia University; and, perhaps most importantly is a graduate of the Senate family, having served as chief legislative assistant to Senator Edmund Muskie. 
I had occasion to work with Ambassador Albright on a number of matters. One of the most important was working with her on the War Crimes Tribunal, where the United States has played an active role in bringing to justice the international criminals from Bosnia and Rwanda. She accompanied me in a meeting which I had several years ago with then Secretary General of the United Nations, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and there has been really good cooperation from the U.S. Government on that important matter. I have had an occasion to visit the War Crimes Tribunal on two occasions; to visit with our staff there, and also the judges. She has played a very important role in promoting the War Crimes Tribunal. 
It is my hope that Secretary of State Albright will pursue an activist foreign policy and will lend the prestige and the power of the United States to solve complex international problems, one which I refer to--and only one for the brevity of time--which involves the efforts to bring conciliation between the Governments of India and Pakistan. 
About a year and a half ago Senator Brown and I were traveling in India and met with Prime Minister Gowda, who commented about his interest in having the subcontinent nuclear free. We then discussed the matter with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan. The ministers of those two countries have not met. Senator Brown and I wrote to the President urging that he invite them to the Oval Office. 
I mention that only as an illustration of what I am hopeful Secretary of State Albright will activate on U.S. policy. 
I think it is important for the United States to remain active internationally. She has an extraordinary background having been born in Czechoslovakia and having come to this country at the age of 11, and is also known to be fluent in four languages. 
So I am pleased to lend my support to her nomination today. 
Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce legislation that will deal with the plight of our nation's cities and Washington's increasing neglect of them. There is an urgent need to improve our urban economies and the quality of life for the millions of American who live in our cities. My proposal, the `New Agenda For Aiding America's Cities Act of 1997' is based on legislation which I introduced in the 103rd and 104th Congress along with my distinguished colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, and I am pleased she is again joining in this effort. The bill constitutes an effort to give our cities some much-needed attention, but reflects the federal budget constraints which govern all that we in Congress do these days. 
This bill, based in significant part on suggestions by Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell and the League of Cities, offers aid to the cities without increasing federal expenditures and by re-instituting important cost-effective tax breaks which have been discontinued. 
If we are to really address many of the very serious social issues that we face--unemployment, teenage pregnancy, welfare dependency, and other pressing issues--we cannot give up on our cities. There must be new strategies for dealing with the problems of urban America. The days of creating `Great Society' federal aid programs are clearly past, but that is no excuse for the national government to turn a blind eye to the problems of the cities. 
The goals of this initiative have strong bipartisan support as indicated during the vice-presidential debate in the 1996 campaign, where both the Republican and Democratic candidates spoke of the need to focus our economic resources in our nation's urban areas. The recent November elections reaffirm the basic principle of limited government. Limited government, however, does not mean an uncaring or do-nothing government. 
The impact of last year's welfare reform legislation also requires close scrutiny on what will be happening to America's big cities. 
Urban areas remain integral to America's greatness as centers of commerce, industry, education, health care, and culture. Yet urban areas, particularly the inner cities which tend to have a disproportionate share of our nation's poor, also have special needs which must be recognized. We must develop ways of aiding our cities that do not require either new taxes or more government bureaucracy. 
I commend the Mayor of Philadelphia, Edward Rendell, for his efforts to revitalize America's cities. Collaborating with the Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities, he proposed in 1994 a `New Urban Agenda.' Much of that proposal is the basis of this legislation. 
As a Philadelphia resident, I have first-hand knowledge of the growing problems that plague our cities. As of 1990, Philadelphia had over 300,000 individuals in poverty. Reflecting on my experience as a Philadelphian, I have long supported a variety of programs to assist our cities, such as increased funding for Community Development Block Grants and legislation to establish enterprise and empowerment zones. To encourage similar efforts, in April, 1994, I hosted my Senate Republican colleagues on a visit to explore urban problems in my hometown. We talked with people who wanted to obtain work, but had found few opportunities. We saw a crumbling infrastructure and its impact on residents and businesses. We were reminded of the devastating effect that the loss of inner city businesses and jobs has had on our neighborhoods in America's cities. What my Republican colleagues saw then in Philadelphia is the urban rule across our country and not the exception. 
There are many who do not know of city life, who are far removed from the cities and would not be expected to have any key interest in what goes on in the big cities of America. I cite my own boyhood experience illustratively: Born in Wichita, Kansas, raised in Russell, a small town of 5,000 people on the plains of Kansas, where there is not much detailed knowledge of what goes on in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or other big cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Miami, Pittsburgh, Dallas, Detroit or Chicago. 
Those big cities are alien to people in much of America. But there is a growing understanding that the problems of big cities contribute significantly to the general problems affecting our nation and have an economic impact, at the very least, on our small towns. For rural America to prosper, we need to make sure that urban America prospers and vice-versa. For example, if cities had more economic growth, taxes could be reduced on all Americans at the federal and state level because revenues would increase and social welfare spending would be reduced. 
What are the problems? Crime for one. Take the Bloods and the Crips gangs from Los Angeles, California, and similar gangs; that are all over America. They are in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Des Moines, Iowa; Portland, Oregon; Jackson, Mississippi; Racine, Wisconsin; and Martinsburg, West Virginia. They are literally everywhere, big city and small city alike. 
According to the National League of Cities 1992 report, `State of America's Cities,' 397 randomly selected municipal leaders said that after overall economic conditions, crime and drugs were the second and third items that had caused their cities to deteriorate the most in the prior five years. In Atlanta, the number of crimes per 100,000 people was 17,067, making it number one in 1995. We have all heard of that unenviable moniker for our nation's capital--the `murder capital.' 
Not just municipal leaders voice concern about crime's impact. Mr. Scott Zelov, President of VIZ Manufacturing in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, told my staff that his workers can't even walk to work in safety anymore, making it difficult for him to retain his employees and to continue to stay in business, causing him to consider moving out of the city to a safer location or even closing his business altogether. 
Dan DeRitis, owner of Sisko, Inc., a property management and development company in the University City section of West Philadelphia, wrote to me to tell me while he has been a resident and business owner in West Philadelphia for more than twenty years, and while the city had been good to him and his family in the past, recently, he has had reason to fear for the safety of his children, his employees and ultimately, his business. He looks desperately for reasons to stay, but everyday it gets harder and harder. 
Joblessness and a less skilled work force is another problem. To facilitate economic development and job creation in the United States, I supported the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which contained such provisions as the Job Training Partnership Act and the Targeted Job Tax Credit. As Congress put the final touches on that legislation, I circulated a joint letter from several Senators to then-Majority Leader Dole and Speaker Gingrich recommending spurring job creation and economic growth in our cities through several urban initiatives such as: a targeted capital gains exclusion, commercial revitalization tax credit, historic rehabilitation tax credit, and child care credit. 
As part of that effort, on December 19, 1995, I arranged a meeting between Majority Leader Dole and Mayors Edward Rendell of Philadelphia, Thomas Menino of Boston, Richard Daley of Chicago, and Victor Ashe, of Knoxville, Tennessee, to discuss their top tax priorities, which were reflected in the joint letter to the Majority Leader Dole and Speaker Gingrich. In that meeting the Mayors stressed the necessity of strengthening economic growth in our urban centers to impact directly on social ills identified with weak economic infrastructures. These problems include poverty, crime, and joblessness. Census data from 1990 shows that many of our urban centers suffered from critically high poverty rates as of 1989. 
As of 1990, New York City led the way, with 1.3 million individuals in poverty. My home of Philadelphia had 313,374 individuals in poverty at that time. These facts emphasize the need for more efforts to be focused on strengthening our inner city businesses which, in turn, will boost local economies and serve to provide more jobs, reduce poverty and, hopefully, reduce crime. 
I have previously introduced legislation to provide targeted tax incentives for investing in small minority- or women-owned businesses. Small businesses provide the bulk of the jobs in this country. Many minority entrepreneurs, for instance, have told me that they are dedicated to staying in the cities to employ people there, but continue to confront capital access issues. My `Minority and Women Capital Formation Act of 1993' would have helped remove the capital access barriers, thereby enabling these entrepreneurs to grow their businesses and payrolls. 
Municipal leaders are stressing many of the same concerns that business people are voicing. In a July, 1994 National League of Cities report dealing with poverty and economic development, municipal leaders ranked inadequate skills and education of workers as one of the top three reasons, in addition to shortage of jobs and below-poverty wages, for poverty and joblessness in their cities. They said, according to the survey, that more jobs must be created 
through local economic development initiatives. 
This `skills deficit' is highlighted in an urban revitalization plan prepared in 1991 by the National Urban League called `Playing to Win: A Marshall Plan for America's Cities.' The report cites a statistic by the Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills which showed that 60 percent of all 21-25 year-olds lack the basic reading and writing skills needed for the modern workplace, and only 10 percent of those in that age group have enough mathematical competence for today's jobs. 
The economic problems our cities are facing are not easy to deal with or answer. In a report by the National League of Cities entitled `City Fiscal Conditions in 1996,' municipal officials from 381 cities answered questions on the economic state of their cities. In response to state budgetary problems, 21.7 percent of responding cities reduced municipal employment and 18.5 percent had frozen municipal employment. Nearly 6 out of 10 cities raised or imposed new taxes or user fees during the past twelve months. 
These numbers are of concern to me and I believe they highlight the need for federal legislation to enhance the ability of cities to achieve competitive economic status. An added concern is that city managers are forced to balance cuts in services or enact higher taxes. Neither choice is easy and it often counteracts municipal efforts to retain residents or businesses. 
One issue, in particular, that is hurting many cities is the erosion of their tax bases, evidenced particularly by middle-class flight to the suburbs. Mr. Ronald Walters, professor of Political Science at Howard University, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in April 1993, stated that in 1950, 23 percent of the American population lived outside central cities; by 1988, that number was up to 46 percent. 
In an October 9, 1994 article in The Washington Post Magazine, David Finkel profiled Ward 7 of Washington, DC and wrote that Ward 7 lost 13,000 residents between 1980 and 1990 alone. He noted further that the population decline in Washington, DC has averaged 10,000 people a year since 1990. This trend continues into 1997. These losses are devastating, not only to the financial stability of the city, but to the social fabric as well. 
On the financial side, statistics show that those people fleeing cities were earning an average of $30,000 to $75,000 a year. On the social side, roughly half of these are African-American middle-class families. By losing this critical demographic group, the city loses much of what makes it strong. 
Eroding tax bases are also caused by job-flight and job loss. Professor Walters testified that Chicago lost 47 percent of its manufacturing jobs between 1972 and 1982. Los Angeles lost 327,000 jobs, half of which were in the manufacturing sector. More recently, according to Census data, New York City had only 11.4 percent of its population employed in manufacturing. According to Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel in a March, 1994 USA Today Magazine article, since the 1970's more than 50 Fortune 500 company headquarters have fled New York City, representing a loss of over 500,000 jobs. 
It is clear that the social fabric of our cities is also deteriorating. The issues of infant mortality and single-parent families are tragic problems that plague American urban areas. According to 1990 Census data, Washington, DC ranked first out of 77 cities for infant death rates per 1,000 live births in 1988. Detroit led the same number of cities in the percentage of one-parent households in 1990 at 53 percent. 
When I traveled to Pittsburgh in 1984, I saw one-pound babies for the first time and I learned that Pittsburgh had the highest infant mortality rate of African-American babies of any city in the United States. It is a human tragedy for a child to be born weighing 16 ounces with attendant problems that last a lifetime. I wondered, how could that be true of Pittsburgh, which has such enormous medical resources. It was an amazing thing for me to see a one-pound baby, about as big as my hand. Indeed, our cities are desperate, and the issues are heavy. 
Historically, cities have been the center of commerce and culture. Surrounding communities have relied on a thriving, growing economy in our metropolitan areas to provide jobs and opportunities. As I have noted though, over the past several decades, America's cities have struggled with the loss or exodus of residents, businesses and industry and other problems. The resulting tax base shrinkage causes enormous budget problems for city governments. Across the country, cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and the District of Columbia have experienced the flight of major industries to the suburbs. 
As a result, city residents who remain are faced with problems ranging from increased tax burdens and lesser services to dwindling economic opportunities, leading to welfare dependence and unemployment assistance. In the face of all this, what do we do? 
The federal government has attempted to revitalize our ailing urban infrastructure by providing federal funding for transit and sewer systems, roads and bridges. I have supported this. For example, as a member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee and as co-chair of an informal Senate Transit Coalition, I have been a strong supporter of public transit which provides critically needed transportation services in urban areas. Transit helps cities meet clean air standards, reduce traffic congestion, and allows disadvantaged persons access to jobs. Federal assistance for urban areas, however, has become increasingly scarce as we grapple with the nation's deficit and debt. Therefore, we must find alternatives to reinvigorate our nation's cities so they can once again be economically productive areas providing promising opportunities for residents and neighboring areas. 
I believe there are ways Congress can assist the cities. In 1994, Mayor Rendell came up with a legislative package which contains many good ideas. I have since added and revised provisions to take into account new developments at the federal, state and local levels. 
First, recognizing that the federal government is the nation's largest purchaser of goods and services, this legislation would require that no less than 15 percent of federal government purchases be made from businesses and industries within designated urban Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. Similarly, it would require that not less than 15 percent of foreign aid funds be redeemed through purchases of products manufactured in urban Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. I presented this idea to then-Treasury Secretary Bentsen at a March 22, 1994, hearing of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. The Secretary responded favorably.

Mr. SPECTER. 
Mr. President, the start of the 105th Congress gives those of us in the Senate and the House a new opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of the American people. It is a chance for us to learn from the past concerning how to best respond to the challenges that are before us and forge important alliances to enable us to pass legislation that is important to the American people. One of our first priorities must be additional reforms of our Nation's health care system. 
In the 104th Congress, I was pleased to cosponsor the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, better known as the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill (S. 1028). There is no question that Kassebaum-Kennedy made significant steps forward in addressing troubling issues in health care. The bill's incremental approach to health care reform is what allowed it to generate consensus support in the Senate; we knew that it did not address every single problem in the health care delivery system, but it would make life better for millions of American men, women, and children. 
There is much more that needs to be done. Accordingly, today I am introducing the Health Care Assurance Act of 1997, which, if enacted, will take us further down the path of incremental reforms started by Kassebaum-Kennedy. It is my firm belief that the best approach to addressing our Nation's health care problems is to enact reforms that improve upon our current market based health care system without completely overhauling our current system. My bill is intended to initiate and stimulate discussion in order to move the health care reform debate forward. I welcome any suggestions my colleagues may have concerning how the bill can be improved, as long as such suggestions are consistent with the incremental approach to reform that has proven to be the only way to obtain successful health care reform. 
I want to note at the outset that through a State-run voucher system, my legislation would address health care coverage for the first time for the vast majority of the 10 million American children who lack health care insurance today. My proposal is compassionate and efficient and will preserve patient choice as its hallmark.

Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to join with Senator Hollings in introducing a joint resolution providing for an amendment to the United States Constitution which would provide authority to the Congress to regulate Federal election spending and to the States to regulate spending in State and local elections. 
This joint resolution is very similar to S.J. Res. 48, which I introduced in the 104th Congress on January 26, 1996, 3 days before the 20th anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in Buckley versus Valeo. It is also very similar to constitutional amendments which Senator Hollings and I have proposed since 1989. 
Now, more than ever, the time has come for meaningful election law reform--reform which necessitates overturning the Buckley decision. 
The unprecedented spending levels during 1996 Presidential and Congressional campaigns should serve as the impetus for approving this consitutional amendment. Presidential candidates spent a total of $237 million in the 1996 primary campaigns, of which $56 million represented publicly funded matching payments. Public financing of the general election added $153 million to the total. One primary candidate decided not to take Federal matching funds and used $37 million of his own resources to fund a campaign in which he was not restricted from the same state-by-state and overall limits as other candidates. 
The 1996 Congressional campaign cycle was similarly grim for all but television station advertising managers and political consultants. There were record levels of spending including $220.8 million by Senate candidates and $405.6 million by House candidates. This spending, much of which went to negative television commercials, did little to restore the public's confidence in the electoral process, much less our institution. 
The Supreme Court has made this proposed amendment even more urgent through its June, 1996 decision in Colorado Republicans Federal Campaign Committee versus Federal Election Commission. In that case, the Court cut an enormous hole in the remaining Federal campaign spending limits by striking down a restriction on party spending when the parties are acting independently of the candidates they support. Justice Breyer's plurality opinion stated that the `independent expression of a political party's views is core 1st Amendment activity' entitled to full protection. Until the Colorado decision, Federal election law limited how much the parties themselves could spend on House and Senate races. Now, it's a multi-million dollar free-for-all, with a prospect of subsequent litigation over the `independence' of such expenditures and a rash of complaints filed against candidates in future election cycles. 
If nothing else, the vast sums of money spent in this recent election, coupled with the June Supreme Court decision, have raised the profile of the Buckley decision even further. I am pleased to note that the view that Buckley should be overturned is shared by a group of prominent constitutional scholars who recently began a campaign to overturn the Buckley decision. According to a November 10, 1996 New York Times article, 26 scholars have signed a statement urging the Supreme Court to reconsider and reverse its 1976 decision, which has essentially allowed an unlimited amount of money to flow into campaign war chests. Among the scholars signing the statement are Bruce Ackerman (Yale Law School), Ronald Dworkin (New York University Law School), Peter Arenella (University of California at Los Angeles Law School), and Robert Aronson (University of Washington Law School). Such a concerted effort by legal scholars, when coupled with Congressional efforts and the public's revulsion at the amount of money in politics, should lead to a new day for campaign finance in which rational, reasonable limits bring sanity back into the political process. 
Overturning the Buckley decision has long been a priority of mine. In fact, the Buckley decision had a very significant impact on this Senator, because at that time in 1976, I was running for the U.S. Senate. I had announced my candidacy on November 17, 1975, for the seat being vacated by a very distinguished Senator, Hugh Scott. Under the 1974 federal election law, there was a limited amount a candidate for the Senate could spend of his or her own money, based on population. For a State the size of Pennsylvania, it was $35,000. That was about the limit of the means which I had at that time, having been extensively involved in public service as district attorney of Philadelphia and for a relatively short period of time in the private practice of law. 
However, I had decided to run for the office of U.S. Senate against a very distinguished American who later became a U.S. Senator, John Heinz, who had more financial resources than I did. I should note that after my eventual election in 1980, he and I formed a very close working partnership and very close friendship. 
In the middle of that campaign, on January 29, 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Buckley v.Valeo and said a candidate can spend any amount of his own money. John Heinz was in a position to do so and did just that. That made an indelible impression upon me, so much so that when the decision came down on January 29, I petitioned for leave to intervene as amicus and filed a set of legal appeals, all of which were denied. John Heinz subsequently won the primary and general elections and served with great distinction until his tragic death. 
As I noted at the outset, this is not a new issue for me to bring before my colleagues. I have sponsored and cosponsored legislation for 7 years and, during the 101st Congress, testified in support of such a Constitutional amendment before the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution on February 28, 1990. 
I gained significant new insight, however, on the subject of campaign spending from my experiences as a candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency during 1994 and 1995. During my travels to 30 States as a Presidential candidate, I was once again impressed with how important fundraising is and how disproportionate it is to the undertaking of a political candidacy. 
My concept of running for elective office, Mr. President, is a matter of issues, a matter of tenacity, a matter of integrity, and how you conduct a campaign. However, money has become the dominant issue in the Presidential campaign. And the media focus on it to the virtual exclusion of the many issues of substantive matters which are really involved in a campaign for the Presidency. 
It has seemed to me since my experiences in 1976, as I have watched enormous expenditures in campaign financing by individuals, that the Buckley decision was based on unsound constitutional interpretation and certainly created unsound public policy. There is nothing in the Constitution, in my legal judgment, which guarantees freedom of speech on any reasonable, realistic, logical constitutional interpretation which says you ought to be able to spend as much money as you have to win an elective office. I think it is high time for the Congress of the United States and the 50 States to reexamine that in a constitutional amendment, which is the purpose of the joint resolution we are introducing today. 
Simply put, Congress should have the authority to establish a spending limit in Federal elections without regard to the first amendment limitation which was applied by the Supreme Court in Buckley. In approaching this matter, Mr. President, I am very concerned about amending the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which covers the freedoms of speech, religion, press, and assembly. But, the constitutional amendment we are proposing really does not go to any of these core first amendment values. This is not a matter affecting religion. It is not a matter really affecting speech. 
I think it was a very far stretch when a divided U.S. Supreme Court said that a campaign contribution from an individual was not a matter of freedom of speech, but spending one's own money in a campaign is protected speech. At that time, the Supreme Court did not affect the limitation on spending where an individual could contribute only $1,000 in the primary and $1,000 in the general, except for contributions by political action committees, which could receive $5,000. 
I would note that in 1976, my brother had considerably more financial means than I did and would have been very much interested in helping his younger brother, but the limitation on my brother in that primary was $1,000. It seemed to me then and it seems to me now that if a candidate has the right to spend as much of his or her money as he or she chooses, then why should not any other citizen have the same right under the first amendment to express himself or herself by political contributions. That distinction by the Buckley court still seems unfounded 20 years later. 
There have been many, many examples of multimillion-dollar expenditures in this body, the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and in State government, and in 1992 and 1996 we have witnessed such expenditures by two men running for President of the United States. The fact of life is, if you advertise enough on television, if you sell candidacies like you sell soap, the sky is the limit. Even the White House of the United States of America, the Office of the President, may be, in fact, up for sale if someone is willing to start off by announcing a willingness to spend $25 million. If you have $400 million, $25 million is not an enormous sum; you still have $375 million left after your campaign. As I have said before, most people can get by on $375 million. Given some of the personal fortunes out there, it is conceivable that someone could spend $50 million or even $75 million to promote a candidacy, both to articulate a positive view and then, perhaps even more effectively, to fund negative television advertisements aimed at opponents. 
A constitutional amendment is also a direct way to deal with campaign finance reform without having a further burden on the Treasury of the United States. We have debated campaign finance reform repeatedly in a variety of contexts. Most proposals come down to a proposition to have Federal subsidies for candidates and then to call upon the candidates to relinquish their rights under Buckley versus Valeo in order to qualify for Federal funding. I have opposed such Federal funding because I think it is unwise to further burden the Treasury by having campaigns paid for by the U.S. Treasury. 
During the 103d Congress, the Senate went on record on this very issue, adopting an amendment to S.3, the campaign finance reform bill, that stated that it was the sense of the Senate that Congress should adopt a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment empowering Congress and the States to set reasonable limits on campaign expenditures. The amendment was approved by a 52-43 vote on May 27, 1993. However, in the 104th Congress, the Senate went backwards in my view. It had the opportunity to adopt this proposal as an amendment to the Balanced Budget Amendment, but it was defeated on a procedural motion by 52-45. 
I am hopeful that the vote in 1995 was an aberration and that a majority of my colleagues will, at long last, agree with me and Senator Hollings, among others, that it is high time we amend the Constitution to overturn the Buckley decision.
