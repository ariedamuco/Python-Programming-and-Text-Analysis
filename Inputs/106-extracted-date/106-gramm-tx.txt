   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I am proud to add my voice in support of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. This legislation represents the end product of work that began in S. 2697, which Senator LUGAR and I introduced on June 8. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 completes the work of last year's financial services modernization law, bringing our financial regulation in line with the rapid pace of developments in the global marketplace. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 will now allow new and important financial products--single stock futures--to be sold in America. It protects financial institutions from over-regulation, and provides legal certainty for the $60 trillion market in swaps. 
   Significant portions of this legislation, particularly in Titles II, III and IV of the Act, concern issues within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
   Title II establishes the authority and framework for the offering of single stock futures, removing the ban embodied in the so-called Shad-Johnson Accord. I would like to take this opportunity to echo the views expressed by my colleague, Congressman BLILEY, Chairman of the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives, at the time of House adoption of this bill. It is my understanding that nothing in Title II of H.R. 5660 would (i) authorize any bank or similar institution to engage in any activity or transaction, or hold any asset, that the institution is not authorized to engage in or hold under its chartering or authorizing statute; (ii) authorize depository  institutions either to take delivery of equity securities under a single stock future or under any other circumstance, or otherwise to invest in any equity security otherwise prohibited for depository institutions; or (iii) allow a depository institution to use single stock futures to circumvent restrictions in the law on ownership of equity securities under its chartering or authorizing statute. 
   Under Title III of the bill, the SEC is granted new authority to undertake certain enforcement actions in connection with security-based swap agreements. It is important to emphasize that nothing in the title should be read to imply that swap agreements are either securities or futures contracts. To emphasize that point, the definition of a ``swap agreement'' is placed in a neutral statute, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, that is, legislation that is not specifically part of a banking, securities, or commodities law. However, drawing upon the SEC's enforcement experience, the SEC is permitted, on a case-by-case basis, with respect to security-based swap agreements (as defined in the legislation) to take action against fraud, manipulation, and insider trading abuses. 
   Title III makes it clear that the SEC is not to impose regulations on such instruments as prophylactic measures. Banks are already heavily regulated institutions. Further regulatory burden, rather than discouraging wrongdoing, would be more likely to discourage development and innovation, during business overseas instead. The SEC is directed to focus on the wrong doers rather than provide new paperwork burden and regulatory costs on the law abiding investors and financial services providers. For example, the SEC is directed not to require the registration of security-based swap agreements. If a registration statement is submitted to the SEC and accepted by the SEC, the agency is required promptly to notify the registrant of the error, and the registration statement will be null and void. 
   Insider trading provisions of the Securities Exchange Act will be applied to single stock futures transactions as well. 
   Title IV of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 contains the Legal Certainty for Bank Products Act of 2000. This title is a free standing provision of law, part of neither the banking statutes not the commodities statutes. The provisions of this title clarify the jurisdictional line between the regulation of banking products and futures products. 
   Under section 403 of Title IV, no provision of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) may apply to, and the CFTC is prohibited from exercising regulatory authority with respect to, an ``identified banking product'' if: (1) an appropriate banking agency certifies that the product has been commonly offered, entered into, or provided in the United States by any bank on or before December 5, 2000, and (2) the product was not prohibited by the CEA and was not in fact regulated by the CFTC as a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option on such a contract or on a commodity) on or before December 5, 2000. This provision is intended to provide legal certainty for existing banking products so that they can continue to be offered, entered into, or provided by banks without being subject to CFTC regulation. 
   An existing banking product is one that is certified by the appropriate banking regulator as being a product is ``commonly'' offered, entered into, or provided, on or before December 5, 2000, in the 
   U.S. by any bank. To rely upon that test a particular bank would not need to have certified that the particular bank had offered the product. The certification would apply if it or any other bank had offered such a product on or before December 5, 2000. The term ``commonly offered'' means, in effect, that the product was not obscure, or offered only briefly. It is not to be construed to mean that the product must be of a type that is appropriate or suitable for any and all users, since many common bank products are tailored for specific customers, small business loans or low cost checking accounts for seniors being two such examples. 
   New banking products not excluded from the CFTC's jurisdiction under Title IV will be, if indexed to a commodity, subject to a test to determine whether they are predominantly banking products, in which case, the CFTC is precluded from exercising regulatory authority over them. The predominance test is a self test. Banks themselves may apply the factors of the predominance test with respect to the development of new products, without making prior application to any regulator. The predominance test as contained in the law is intended to replace regulatory provisions under the Commodity Exchange Act concerning the application of a predominance test with respect to hybrid instruments. 
   Under the predominance test, a hybrid instrument will be considered to be predominantly a banking product if (1) the issuer of the instrument receives payment in full of the purchase price of the instrument substantially contemporaneously with its delivery, (2) the purchaser or holder of the hybrid is not required to make any payment to the issuer in addition to the purchase price during the life of the instrument or at maturity, (3) the issuer is not subject to mark-to-market margining requirements, and (4) the hybrid is not marketed as a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery or an option subject to the CEA. 
   If a bank, having applied the predominance test to a new product, determines that the product is predominantly a banking product not subject to CFTC regulation, and the CFTC later challenges the bank's conclusion, the CFTC is still prohibited from exercising regulatory authority over the product unless the Commission obtains the concurrence of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board (Board). If the Board does not concur in the CFTC's decision, the Board may submit the controversy for determination by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
   The CFTC is expected to be circumspect in applying the predominance test. For example, it does not necessarily follow that a hybrid instrument not satisfying the predominance test is inevitably a futures contract subject to CFTC regulation. The CFTC must not interpret normal or traditional banking practices and activities, or prudent actions taken by a bank to maintain safety and soundness, to be hybrid instruments that the CFTC may regulate. For example, a loan made by a bank is an identified banking product under section 206(a)(3) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Some may argue that a new loan product offered after December 5, 2000, may be interpreted to be covered by the definition of a hybrid instrument if it has one or payments indexed to the value of, or provides for the delivery of, one or more commodities. However, there would be little justification for the CFTC to construe the pledging of a commodity as collateral for a loan, or that providing that a commodity may be offered as part or full satisfaction of a loan, to be representative of a futures contract over which the CFTC may exert jurisdiction. No such result is contemplated under this legislation. 
   Moreover, the fact that a loan may be renegotiated or sold, or that a loan or other identified banking product may not be held until maturity, is not a violation of the predominance test. These are merely examples of the reasonable interpretations that the CFTC must adhere to when it applies the predominance test for purposes of the statute. 
   The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 excludes from its coverage agreements, contracts or transactions in an excluded commodity entered into on an electronic trading facility provided that such agreements, contracts or transactions are entered into only by eligible contract participants on a principal-to-principal basis trading for their own accounts. In some cases, a party may enter into an agreement, contact or transaction on an electronic trading facility that mirrors another agreement, contract or transaction entered into at about the same time with a customer. The risk of one transaction may be largely or completely offset by the other; and that may be the purpose for entering into both transactions. But the party entering into both transactions remains liable to each of its counterparties throughout the life of the transaction. That party is similarly exposed to the credit risk of each of its counterparties. The fact that a party  has entered into back-to-back transactions as described above does not alter the principal-to-principal nature of each of the transactions and must not be construed to affect the eligibility of either transaction for the electronic trading facility exclusion. 
   Mr. President, enactment of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 will be noted as a major achievement by the 106th Congress. Taken together with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the work of this Congress will be seen as a watershed, where we turned away from the outmoded, Depression-era approach to financial regulation and adopted a framework that will position our financial services industries to be world leaders into the new century.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I join with Senator LUGAR, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and several others of our colleagues to introduce the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. The formal purpose of this legislation is to reauthorize the Commodity Exchange Act, the legal authority for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As important as that is, this legislation does far more. 
   This is a landmark bill that addresses the two major purposes that Senator LUGAR and I set out to achieve when we first began discussing this legislation. First of all, this bill would repeal the so-called Shad-Johnson Accord, the 18-year-old temporary prohibition on the trading of futures based on individual stocks. Second, the bill eliminates the legal uncertainty that today hangs as an ominous cloud over the $60 trillion financial swaps markets. 
   We are introducing the bill today as the finished product of years of work involving half a dozen committees in both Houses of Congress, and as many agencies of the Federal government. This bill is identical to, and is the Senate companion to, H.R. 5660, introduced yesterday in the House and which will be approved by the House and the Senate today. We introduce this bill in the Senate to demonstrate the bicameral authorship and support for this important legislation. 
   For legislative history, I would direct my colleagues to statements made  elsewhere in the RECORD in connection with House and Senate action on the House companion, part of the package of legislation approved together with the Labor HHS appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. 
   I would take this opportunity to thank Chairman LUGAR and all who had a hand in forming this important legislation. All who had a hand in it deserve to be proud of this product. 
   Mr. DURBIN:

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to come over this morning and join my colleagues in talking about our dear friend and colleague, SLADE GORTON. I don't have enough time this morning to list all the things this good man has done for America. It is hard to even contemplate lifting all of the times he has provided critical leadership for the Senate. 
   The thing that stands out most about SLADE is that he is wise. There is a difference between intellect and wisdom. Intellect is, in my opinion, often overrated. I see intellect as being like the lens on your camera. The better that lens is, the wider your frame can be on the picture and the finer the detail can be on that picture. So if you are blessed to have good intellect, you are advantaged. What is important is the ability to take the information that your lens on the world can see and put that into a perspective where it has meaning. That is where wisdom comes in.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today the Senate is taking up H.R. 5640, the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives on December 5, 2000. Companion legislation, sponsored by Senator ALLARD and myself, together with Senators SARBANES, SANTORUM, GRAMS, SHELBY, CAMPBELL, and KERRY, was introduced on December 5. This legislation is the product of bipartisan work and negotiations in both bodies, and I urge the Senate to pass this bill today. 
   As Chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, I have had the privilege of working closely with Housing and Transportation Subcommittee Chairman ALLARD and want to express my appreciation for his strong leadership and commend him for the successful stewardship of this legislation. 
   The legislation we are considering today will improve and modernize a variety of federal housing programs. The proposed changes to our nation's housing laws will increase the efficiencies of subsidized housing programs and provide that a greater number of truly needy Americans may be assisted at no greater cost to the American taxpayer. 
   I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act--signifying a cooperative product involving input from industry and other interested parties that successfully ends a 10-year legislative stalemate. The bill modernizes the requirements of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, a 26 year-old statute in serious need of revision. Manufactured housing reform is of great importance to the State of Texas, which leads the Nation in the production and sale of manufactured homes. Across America, manufactured homes are a significant source of affordable housing--representing 25 percent of all new single-family housing starts. I also want to give special thanks to Senator SHELBY, the original lead sponsor of the manufactured housing bill, who has worked tirelessly over the years for its passage. Without Senator SHELBY's dedication and perseverance, the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act title of this bill would not be before the Senate for consideration today. 
   The American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act contains many other significant housing provisions, including modernization of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's, HUD, Section 202 elderly housing and Section 811 disabled housing programs; the Department of Agriculture's rural housing programs; HUD Native American housing programs; and the HUD home equity conversion mortgage program, which allows our cash-poor but house-rich senior citizens the opportunity to utilize their home equity for needed expenses. 
   This legislation also renews some 45 reporting requirements of Executive Branch and regulatory agencies, including the report of the Federal Reserve Board on the conduct of monetary policy. 
   H.R. 5640 directs that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve appear before the Congress twice annually, once in February and again in July, to report on the Federal Reserve's activities with respect to the conduct of monetary policy and its outlook regarding economic developments and prospects in the future. This legislation eliminates the requirement of the Federal Reserve to report on many of the outdated economic indicators required in the past, such as measures of money supply that are no longer useful. 
   Among other reports reinstated in this legislation are the Annual Economic Report of the President and annual reports from numerous banking and housing agencies, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Housing Finance Board, and National Credit Union Administration. All of these reports are important in helping Congress conduct its constitutional oversight responsibilities and ensuring that agencies and departments are ultimately accountable to the American taxpayer. 
   Mr. President, these are but a few of the highlights of the important provisions in H.R. 5640. I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, both in the Senate and the House, in crafting this compromise legislation. In particular, I would like to note the extensive cooperation of Senators SARBANES and KERRY in working out many of the provisions of this bill. I urge adoption of the bill by the Senate.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I congratulate our dear colleague from New York. I thank him for his leadership in defense of trade. We had these running debates, most of them related to the Presidential campaign. Most have nothing to do with the business of the Senate in these waning hours of the session. Instead they are about who deserves or what deserves credit for the golden economic era in which we live. I think the plain answer is, more than anything else, the creation of a wealth-generating machine through world trade is responsible for this economic golden age in which we live. 
   Our colleague is what I think of as an ``old-timey'' Democrat. There used to be a lot more of them here than there are now. Unfortunately, there is going to be one fewer. Some might think the number would be zero after Senator MOYNIHAN. But there was a time when there was a bipartisan consensus in favor of world trade. Unfortunately, now it is so easy to demagog against trade because you can identify a potential loser. If a company shuts down, whether it was inefficient or ``moved off to Mexico,'' the claim is, ``They moved off to Mexico.'' Everybody who loses a job there knows it. But the 10 or 100 jobs we create for every 1 we lose, people do not know why they were created. So it is hard, politically, to stand up for economic freedom. But what is a more basic economic freedom than the right to produce things and sell them all around the world? 
   I would also like to say, in an era where a lot of people are running away and hiding on the issue of Social Security or pretending the problem is somehow going to go away, I again congratulate our colleague from New York for being willing to stand up on that issue. He has made it clear that unless we do something about Social Security, unless we create a wealth source  to pay benefits, we are perpetuating a cruel hoax where we are going to end up, in 12 or 15 years, having to make excruciatingly painful choices. These are not just choices about spending cuts versus taxes, but really they are choices we will have to make between our parents and our children, between the security of our parents and the economic opportunity of our children. We will have to make those choices because of failed leadership right now to deal with this issue. 
   I did not want to pass up this chance to say to my colleague from New York I am glad he came our way. I am proud to call him my friend and colleague. 
   I remember the first dealing I ever had with the Senator from New York. It was on a TV talk show. I don't know if he remembers it. We sort of had a sharp exchange. I would like to say I am not as ignorant as I used to be. I thank our colleague from New York for being an instructor for me and for America. I am proud of his academic background. I am proud to share it with him.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to comment on where we are. I am sure the American people are confused. They hear the President saying one thing, they hear Congress saying another. They see chaos, they see gridlock, they see politics as usual. I am sure they are wondering what is this all about. Let me try, in the remaining moments I have, to explain. 
   We are at the end of an 8-year Presidency. Americans are going to the polls next Tuesday to make a fundamental decision. But we have a President in the White House now who would like to make the decision for the future while he is still President, by forcing Congress to spend far beyond the budget we wrote and far beyond the budget he wrote. The President has, in essence, said that if we will spend 30 percent more on social programs in Health and Human Services than we spent last year, if we will then make some permanent changes in law in addition to that spending, such as giving amnesty to people who have broken the Nation's laws and come to the country illegally, he will sign this bill and let us go home. 
   Let me tell you why we are not going to do that and why we are going to resist. First, I do not believe the American people want Bill Clinton, or this Congress for that matter, making decisions for the new President and the new Congress. It is time to have an election. It is time to move on. What we have is a President who almost is unhappy because the focus of attention is on the two men who are now running for President. And so, he believes that by vetoing bills he has agreed to sign and by demanding more and more spending, he gets his name back in the paper and gets on television. 
   Let me tell you why we should say no. We should say no because the American people ought to decide. If we did what Bill Clinton is calling on us to do, before the new President ever took his hand off the Bible we would have spent between a third and a half of the budget surplus. 
   I think the American people think they are deciding in this election. If people want to spend this money, they can vote for AL GORE. If they want to use the money to let working people have a tax cut and to invest it in rebuilding Social Security and Medicare, they can vote for George Bush. But however they are going to vote, Bill Clinton should not be making the decision to spend it before the American people can vote. 
   Let me convert it down to a simple number. For every day that we simply fund at this year's level the remaining parts of Government that are not yet appropriated for, we save between $88 and $133 million a year. By just continuing to fund at this year's level and waiting for the next President to arrive, over a 12-month period we would spend $32 billion less by not creating all these new programs, by not hiring all these new Government employees, by not making the President the president of every school board in America. 
   Nobody knows what $132 billion is so let me convert it into something you know. As you know, you can buy a very nice pickup truck for $20,000. You can buy basically a loaded Chevrolet or Ford pickup, full-size pickup, for $20,000. By simply saying no to Bill Clinton for 6 more days and simply leaving spending at its current level, we could buy 1.6 million pickup trucks. I think the American people understand what 1.6 million pickup trucks are. 
   I know there are some people who hope, even at this last minute, to cut a deal with Bill Clinton and bring to the floor of the Senate a bill that will spend $32 billion more on social programs. Let me tell you, today is Wednesday. We are going to have an election on Tuesday. They have never put an election off in American history. I just want to say to people, a deal is not going to happen. If a deal is cut today, spending $32 billion, 
   basically taking 1.6 million pickup trucks right off people's driveways and out of their garages, I am going to object. We are not going to vote to spend that money before the people of America can vote in this election. 
   They are going to decide, depending on how they vote. They may tell us to spend it and a lot more, or they may say give some of it back. We may create a wealth base for Social Security but that is going to be decided by voters. But what is not going to be decided by this President and what is not going to be decided by this Congress before the election is that we are going to go on a massive spending spree. That is not going to happen. 
   How do I know it is not going to happen? Because today is Wednesday. Under the rules of the Senate, if a few people say no, it can't be done, it will not be done. 
   I think what we ought to do on a bipartisan basis is to pass a resolution funding the Government through the election, let the American people speak, and let them say what they want to happen with this money. Not Bill Clinton because he is on the way out. Let them say through this election and whom they elect what they want done. 
   It is not the time to be listening to the voices of the past. It is time to be looking to the future. Let's pass this CR through the election, keep spending where it is right now, and let the American people speak on Tuesday. Then we can come back here, we will have heard the message from back home, and we can respond to it. 
   I think that is the rational thing to do, and that is what I am going to support. I also believe that is what is going to happen. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am very concerned about how the Medicare program has chosen to pay the 10 freestanding cancer hospitals for outpatient services.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank Senator DOMENICI. I want to try to add a few things to what he said, and then go on and say what I was going to say. 
   I want to begin with the Secretary of Treasury, Larry Summers. Let me say that we are both good friends as well as economists. We both used to teach economics. 
   Yet, I think a lot of people are unhappy in that the Secretary of Treasury injected himself into politics--something that the Secretary of Treasury, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of 
   Defense have not done in the past. I think that made people unhappy. 
   But let me say this with regard to AL GORE's plan, a plan which simply adds IOUs to the Social Security trust fund. I believe Larry Summers would have given an ``F'' to any freshman economics student in his class who thought that you could strengthen Social Security by simply printing paper--IOUs; I have a copy of one here--and putting them into a filing cabinet in West Virginia. 
   Let me give a high authority on this issue, the President of the United States. 
   Our Vice President said if we would simply print more of these IOUs--you notice, Senator DOMENICI, that they say ``nontransferable''--if we printed more of these IOUs and put them in a metal filing cabinet in West Virginia, which is all the Social Security trust fund is, we could pay benefits with these IOUs. 
   But let me quote from the economic report of the President. This is President Clinton speaking. This is the Fiscal Year 2000 Budget of the President, and on page 337, here is what he says about these paper IOUs. He says:  
   These [Social Security trust fund] balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only in a bookkeeping sense. These funds are not set up to be pension funds, like the fund of private pension plans. They do not consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The existence of large trust fund balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on the government's ability to pay benefits.  
   That is Bill Clinton. 
   So AL GORE's proposal to simply print more IOUs and put them in a file cabinet is deemed as phony--not by PETE DOMENICI, not by PHIL GRAMM, not by the Republican Congress, but by the President of the United States, Bill Clinton. The President's own budget says it very clearly. This is a bookkeeping entry. No benefits can be paid from these IOUs. 
   The Gore plan means, in essence, raising taxes. 
   Just one other point to amplify what Senator DOMENICI said. A picture is worth 1,000 words. 
   This is page D11 of the Washington Post of this past Tuesday. This is a want-ad page. You have used want-ads yourself. So have I when looking for a job. 
   These are jobs that range from pet groomers, to painters, to data entry, to day labor, to dispatchers, to retail sales jobs, and everything in between. 
   You might look at this want-ad page in Tuesday's Washington Post and ask yourself, how many people who took these jobs would get an AL GORE tax cut where they could keep part of what they earned and spend it on what they chose to spend it on? 
   Here are all the jobs from pet groomer, to custodian, and the list goes on and on. 
   You see all the jobs. They are the people who, if they took those jobs and were married, could get marriage penalty tax relief from Republicans. 
   I am tempted to go through and read the jobs. But I am not going to denigrate good jobs in America. 
   But the point is that all of the jobs listed on page D11 in Tuesday's Washington Post want-ad page for jobs, for every one of those jobs, if you took it, you would be to rich to get AL GORE's marriage penalty tax relief. 
   This is what would be left.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAMM. The question is, if married couples took these jobs, are they too rich for AL GORE's tax cut? All of them are, except that handful--about 89 percent of the jobs on that page are too rich. 
   Let me get to what I wanted to say. 
   Some people at home probably wonder why we are talking about the Presidential campaign on the floor of the Senate. I think it is a good question. We weren't doing it. Our colleagues have come out here every day and talked about the Presidential campaign, I guess, because they are losing it in America. They think they might win it on the floor of the Senate. 
   One of the wonderful stories that has been told is that Bill Clinton was elected President, and he courageously proposed the largest tax increase in American history. 
   They did everything from proposing to tax your utility bill, to taxing gasoline, to taxing 75 percent of Social Security benefits if you made over $25,000. 
   Courageously, the Vice President, sitting in that very chair, and Senator DOMENICI was here along with me, when it came down to a tie vote, the Vice President courageously broke the tie in voting to tax gasoline and tax Social Security benefits. And then as if the sky opened and God spoke, interest rates came down, the stock market went up, the economy prospered, and, therefore, our Vice President and the Democrats deserve credit. 
   Senator DOMENICI, myself, and every other Republican were too ignorant to understand that by taxing gasoline and taxing Social Security and having the largest tax increase in American history, we could produce prosperity.

   Mr. GRAMM. That is right. They had a majority in both Houses of Congress when Bill Clinton became President, and when they voted they had a substantial majority here, I think 54 or 55 Democrats. Six of them voted with us against this largest tax increase in American history, but there was a tie and AL GORE broke the tie. It was then that the sky opened, interest rates came down, the stock market spiraled, and prosperity ensued. 
   There are only a couple of problems with that. One, it is totally unbelievable. It makes absolutely no sense. Finally, it is verifiably false. 
   This is the rest of the story. This is the budget that included this largest tax cut in American history. In this budget, ``A Vision of Change for America,'' Bill Clinton tells us on page 22 that if we raise taxes with the largest tax increase in American history, and 6 years later, if we implement the largest tax increase in American history, 6 years later he states the deficit will be $241 billion. Nowhere in this budget is  Bill Clinton promising to balance the Federal budget. His promise is, if you have the largest tax cut in American history--and then they forget or our Democrat colleagues want us to forget the rest of the story--if you spend $26 billion on a new stimulus package, they were going to stimulate the economy. Remember they had ice skating huts in Connecticut, they had Alpine slides, these water slides in Puerto Rico. This was their economic plan. We killed that. 
   The final part of their proposal that Senator DOMENICI will not have forgotten but our Democrat colleagues want to forget was having the Government take over and run the health care system. That was part of this vision, too. But we killed it deader than Elvis. It never came into reality. 
   Here is my point: we didn't adopt the Clinton plan. They raised taxes, they taxed Social Security benefits, they taxed gasoline. But we killed their $26 billion spending program, and we killed the Government takeover of health care. 
   Now, their first budget, with the largest tax increase in American history, promised $241 billion of deficits 6 years later. Then, in their midsession review in September of 1993, they discovered we hadn't done the stimulus package. So with their tax increase, we were headed for a $181 billion deficit in 6 years. 
   Then, in 1995, the President proposed another budget. But in 1995, President Clinton, who now has courageously raised taxes on Social Security and gasoline and most other things, is asked, well, Mr. President, when are you going to balance the budget? Remember that, Senator DOMENICI? This is what he said: In 9 years, 10 years, 8 years, 9 years, 7 years, 7 to 9 years, 7 years, 9 years, 10 years. In other words, 2 years after his tax increase went into effect, our colleagues were asking Bill Clinton when he wants to balance the budget. Two years after his tax hike, he was still saying we are 9, 10, 7 years away from ever balancing the Federal budget. 
   Now, what happened in 1994? Our colleagues joshed around yesterday saying when they proposed to have the Government take over the health care system, when they proposed this $26 billion of 
   stimulus package, and when they adopted the largest tax increase in American history, I said this is going to cost people their jobs. So they josh around saying: Well, where did it cost jobs? 
   Let me state what happened: In 1994, 52 Democrats in the House of Representatives lost their jobs. The Speaker of the House lost his job; the first time in 132 years that it ever happened. Three powerful committee chairmen--Rostenkowski, Brooks, and Glickman--lost their jobs. Not one Republican incumbent in Congress was defeated. 
   Now, supposedly the sky had opened. Everything was wonderful with this tax increase. But guess what. When the new Republican Congress came to Washington, this is the first thing that landed on our desk, and this is Bill Clinton's budget. He is still President. He sends us a new budget. He says that by the end of 1999, if we will adopt his budget, the deficit will be $181 billion. 
   Now, his tax increase has been the law of the land now for 2 years. Yet he is still saying virtually $200 billion deficits as far as the eye can see. 
   Let me make a final point that I think takes the cake. In his midsession review, this is in September of 1995, we have a Republican Congress. Bill Clinton says: If you will forget what these Republicans are saying and adopt my budget, if you are willing to cut $927 billion of programs over the next 10 years, then we might have a surplus in 10 years. 
   We didn't adopt Bill Clinton's budget. His budget said we were going to have a $200 billion deficit from 1994 to the year 2000. Instead, we adopted our own budget. We reformed welfare. Bill Clinton now says the greatest achievement of his administration is welfare reform. He not only had nothing to do with it, he fought it every step of the way. He vetoed it once, then twice, and he has tried to repeal it every day since it has passed. 
   Republicans reformed welfare and it set into motion--and I have to say as Democrats accused us of not knowing what was going on that I never dreamed it would be as successful as it has been--a 40-percent decline in welfare rolls as people have begun to work and America has prospered. 
   What happened under the Republican Congress? We started it at a $200 billion deficit, but under the Republican Congress the deficit started to decline. By 1997, we balanced the budget and we have a surplus. 
   When Bill Clinton signed this heroic tax increase, and this is from his official documents, he gave a statement in signing the bill. 
   How many times do you think he mentioned balancing the budget when he signed that tax increase? None. How many times do you think he talked about saving and reforming Social Security and Medicare? None. Those things were the furthest thing from his mind. 
   If you listen to the mythology that we have been forced to listen to here, the mythology runs as follows. They raised taxes, and then interest rates declined and the stock market boomed--right? 
   The problem is that is wrong. If you look at their numbers, when Bill Clinton became President, 10-year Treasury interest rates were 5.87 percent. He raised taxes, and what do you think happened to interest rates? They went up to 7.9 percent. And if you look at the chart on interest, the big turning point in interest occurred in November of 1994. Why? Because help was on the way. Help was on the way. We elected a Republican Congress, interest rates went down, and that interest rate, which had risen to 7.9 percent on 10-year Treasury bonds is, today, 5.71 percent. 
   What about this booming stock market? By raising taxes on gasoline and Social Security and the largest tax increase in American history, their mythology is that Bill Clinton set off this boom in the stock market. There is only one problem: It ain't so. When you look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average between 1993 and 1994, over that 2-year period when Bill Clinton's tax increase went into effect, the Dow went up by 13 points, about 6.5 or 7 percent a year--around there. I don't have the exact day of the tax and the day Clinton became President--just looking at the numbers. 
   What do you think happened when we elected a Republican Congress? What happened was the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 4,493 to 10,836, today. 
   So the problem with their story which they are trying to tell the American people is that it is not believable, it does not make sense, and it is verifiably false. When they raised taxes, none of their budgets showed these tax increases ever balancing the Federal budget. When they raised taxes, there was no decline in interest rates. Interest rates went up, not down. When they raised taxes, the stock market was relatively flat. All of that changed when we elected a Republican Congress in 1994. All of that changed. 
   So basically the point I want to make--how much time have I left in the 20 minutes?

   Mr. GRAMM. The point I want to make is: Look, there is plenty of credit to go around for the good things that have happened in America. I am not trying to deny the President some of the credit. I do believe a lot of credit goes to the Federal Reserve Bank. But the idea that by imposing the largest tax increase in American history, by taxing gasoline, by taxing Social Security benefits, and that somehow this produced a balanced budget and set off this economic boom is laughable from a logical point of view. It is not borne out by the facts. The truth is, these good things that started happening largely started happening in November of 1994. 
   It was a good story. Maybe somebody believes it, but they should not. If they look at the facts, they will see that basically that story is not true. 
   The final point I want to make: We are now coming to the end of this session. In the waning hours of this Congress, the President is saying: If you don't spend more money, I am not going to let the Congress go home. If you do not further inflate an already inflated budget, I am going to veto these bills and not allow us to go home. He is saying to us: If you do not grant amnesty to people who violated the laws of America by coming to the country illegally, I am going to veto the Commerce-Justice-State bill and  potentially shut down the FBI, the DEA, the criminal justice system, and the courts. 
   We are at the end of the Clinton administration, not at the 
   beginning. President Clinton had his opportunity. He raised taxes. He tried to implement a $26 billion stimulus package. He tried to have the Government take over and run the health care business. He had his chance. 
   We ought to have this election and let people decide. Do they want to spend this surplus? If they do, they will know how to vote. If they do not----

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, I wanted to take a moment to discuss H.R. 5239, the Export Administration Modification and Clarification Act. The Senate approved H.R. 5239 with a substitute amendment on October 11, and the House took up and passed the bill, as amended, earlier this afternoon. 
   Since 1994 our export control system has been maintained under a regulatory framework pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act based on the provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979. The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA), which administers our export controls, recently has faced court challenges regarding the integrity of that framework. Specifically, the courts have questioned BXA's authority--known as 12(c) authority--to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information submitted by industry pursuant to our export control rules. 
   While comprehensive review and updating of the Export Administration Act will be early on the agenda of the Senate Banking Committee next year, we are undertaking a simple extension of the 1979 Act at this time to set the stage for that review. It is important to note, however, that replacing the 1994 expiration date with a 2001 expiration date will make clear that BXA's authority to apply the 12(c) confidentiality provision of the 1979 act is to be considered as covering any information regarding license applications obtained during that time period, as if there had been no interruption of authority.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there are two issues I wish to talk about and they are related to the two bills that are before the Senate. Let me begin with the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. 
   As my colleagues are aware, we currently have a situation--Senator DOMENICI has been here longer than I have--that I don't ever remember. A President is threatening to veto a bill based on an issue other than what is in the bill. Obviously, there have been many vetoes as part of our constitutional process. But normally when we are dealing with an appropriations bill, it has to do with funding or not funding various priorities. 
   What we have before the Senate is an extraordinary circumstance where the President of the United States is literally threatening to veto this bill, saying if we don't add a totally extraneous matter that has nothing whatever to do with funding the law enforcement effort in America, then he is going to veto the bill appropriating funds for the criminal justice system and law enforcement in America. 
   What is even a greater paradox, in my opinion--I have to say, in my period of public life I have never seen anything like it--the President is saying, if we don't grant amnesty to people who violated the law, he will veto a bill that funds DEA, the FBI, the Justice Department, the prison system. He is literally threatening if we don't pass a law forgiving people who violated the law by coming into this country illegally, if we don't grant them amnesty and therefore forgiveness for having violated the law, his threat to us is that he is going to risk shutting down the FBI, the DEA, the criminal justice system, the courts, and the prisons. 
   That is an extraordinary threat. It is a threat that, I am happy to say, is opposed on a bipartisan basis by at least one Democrat who happens to be the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. It is opposed very strongly by many Republicans. 
   I want to say on this bill to our President, I want him to sign the bill funding our drug enforcement effort, the FBI, the prison system, our criminal justice system, our courts. I want to urge the President to do that, but I want to make it clear to him there is at least one Member of the Senate who is never going to grant amnesty for illegal aliens to pay a political bribe to the President. That is what this issue is about. This is about electioneering, where the President is putting politics in front of people. He is willing to play politics with law enforcement and the criminal justice system, to try to pressure us to grant amnesty for law breakers. 
   I despair of trying to reason with the President in the waning hours of his administration, but I say again to the extent that any one Member can influence this decision, we will not grant amnesty to illegal aliens in this Congress or, hopefully, ever again. We did that once. Everybody said it was a one-time deal. We were never going to do it again. The problem with doing it was we reward people who violated the law. We reward people who came into the country illegally. 
   Granting amnesty to people who broke the law penalizes the millions of people who are waiting to come to America legally. What we have proposed, and what is in the bill before us, is a provision which I believe is strongly supported by the vast majority of Americans. That provision basically says if you came to America legally, if you played by the rules, if you have been self-supporting while you are here, we will expedite the process to allow you to bring your spouse and your dependent children. We are for family unification. 
   The President, by vetoing this bill, will be denying family unification. 
   We also say, where there is a legal dispute, a legitimate dispute as to whether people have gotten justice through the courts based on recent court rulings, we give them their day in court because we believe in due process. 
   I do not need to say any more about this issue other than to simply say I hope the President will sign this bill. I know he probably believes he is going to force us to grant amnesty to illegal aliens in return for funding the DEA and the FBI, but I want to tell him I am not going to support it, I am going to oppose it vigorously. There are many Members of the Senate, I believe, who share my views. The President may win it, but he is not going to win it without one big terrific fight. In the end, I think nobody benefits from that kind of politics as usual. 
   I want to now say something about the tax bill that is before us. I would have to say it is pretty extraordinary that the President picked out and attacked as a rich person's provision the one provision in this bill that I would have thought was absolutely unassailable. In fact, our President can say things with a straight face that Shakespeare's Richard III would blush in saying. 
   That is a strong statement, but let me give an example. As I am sure everybody in this chamber knows, the general pattern in America is, if you have a good job, if you are making good wages, part of your employment package is health insurance. I have the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield policy. People who work for the Government are blessed with good health insurance. People who make high wages in America get their health insurance through their job. 
   One of the good things in this tax bill is that we think it is wrong that, if the Federal Government helps buy me health insurance, it is tax deductible; if General Motors buys health insurance for its employees, it is tax deductible; but if somebody makes a low wage and their company does not provide health insurance, they have to buy their health insurance with after-tax dollars, they get no deduction. 
   In what I think is excellent public policy in this bill, we make health insurance tax deductible for everybody: For the self-employed, for the small business person, and for the person who is working at $7 an hour and who is not provided health insurance where they work. 
   You would think that would be pretty unassailable, but it is not unassailable by Bill Clinton, because this morning on the radio, Bill Clinton, through his spokesman, was saying that we are giving health benefits to rich people by providing deductibility for health insurance. I ask my colleagues, do you know any rich people who do not get health insurance through their jobs? Do you know any rich people who do not get health insurance by being members of corporate boards? 
   The point is, this is a bill, at least in this provision, that is targeted precisely at moderate-income people who get cheated in the system because their employer cannot afford to buy them health insurance and they have to buy it with after-tax dollars. That would seem to me to be an unassailable position. But to Bill Clinton, it is helping rich people and he is not for it. 
   The plain truth is, any tax cut in Bill Clinton's mind helps rich people, so he is not for it.

   Mr. GRAMM. Let me tell you how it works. Let me take two individuals. Let's say one works for General Motors and one works at the Exxon station in College Station. The one who works for General Motors gets health insurance as part of his employment contract. General Motors provides health insurance and it is a nontaxable benefit to the employee. So, in essence, the employee who works for General Motors gets health insurance and the company can deduct from its taxable income the cost of buying the insurance. 
   Joe Brown, who works at the Exxon station changing tires, may work for a small, independent filling station operator who cannot afford to buy health insurance for the employees at the station. So for Joe Brown to get health insurance, he has to earn income, he has to take what is left after the Government takes its share and then, with after-tax dollars, he has to buy health insurance for him and his family and he gets no deduction for the cost of his insurance. 
   What does it mean? It means if you are a high-income worker and you work for a company that provides health insurance, the company gets a  tax break but if you are a low-income wage earner who has to buy his health insurance himself, you don't get the tax break. We think that is wrong. What this bill does, in its best provision, is it treats everybody the same and says Joe Brown can buy health insurance with pretax dollars, just as General Motors can. It is expensive because we have a lot of Americans, moderate-income people, who are now buying health insurance with after-tax dollars. We think it is a question of fairness. So we fix it in the bill. 
   What does President Clinton say? ``This is a provision that is helping rich people.'' I just simply pose the question: Do you know any rich person who does not get health insurance through his or her job? I do not know any. I have never met a poor person--excuse me--a rich person like that; I have met plenty of poor people who do not get health insurance through their jobs--but I have never met any high-income person who did not have health insurance through his or her job. 
   How the President can stand up with a straight face and say this provision is for rich people, I do not understand. I also do not understand why the Washington Post and other people in the media write it in the paper, as if it were believable, that somehow people who buy their own health insurance because they do not get it through their job--principally low-income or moderate-income people--are suddenly rich merely because we are trying to treat them like everybody else. 
   Let me make one final comment about the tax bill before I run out of time. Our dear colleague from Nebraska, Senator KERREY--Democrat, for anyone who was not here listening--remarked that this did not look like a Republican tax bill. In fact, he wondered what we were doing with a tax bill that looks like a grab bag of 300 different parts. Let me say, to be bipartisan today, he is absolutely right. But why do we have a tax bill that looks like a 300-part grab bag with one little provision here and one little provision there? It doesn't sound very Republican. Repeal the marriage penalty, repeal the death tax, cut rates across the board is what we want to do. 
   We have the bill we have because we have the President we have. This was the only bill we had any chance of getting him to sign. He's vetoed the others. 
   The President is threatening, and apparently being supported by Members of his party in Congress, that he is going to veto this bill. Let me say to my colleagues, and say to the President, have at it. 
   The bad news is that Bill Clinton is going to veto this bill. The good news is he is not going to be President next year. The good news is we are going to have a President, I believe, who will sign a repeal of the marriage penalty, a repeal of the death tax, and cut rates across-the-board. And that is what we are really for. 
   So, Mr. President--and I am talking to the President downtown--we wrote this bill because we thought this was what we had to do to get you to sign it. But if you do not want to sign it, veto it. I will vote to sustain your veto. I am going to be here next year. And next year we will write a much better bill than this bill. This is like the threat--the President reminds me of the guy who is holding a gun to his head and saying: Do what I say, or I will shoot. 
   ``If you do not legalize criminal activity, I am going to shut down the FBI,'' he says. If we don't take this tax cut bill and write it his way, adding more and more of his provisions and fewer things that we are for, he says he is going to veto it. 
   I say: Look, free country. Bill Clinton is President. We tried to write a bill we thought would help America that he might sign, but this is not our bill. This is not our agenda. This does not represent our philosophy. If the President wants to sign it, great. If he wants to veto it, veto it. But remember this. There is not going to be another tax bill. If the President wants to veto this tax bill, this is going to be the last tax bill this year 
   because we are going to be back here next year, we will have a new President next year, and we will produce a better product.

   Mr. GRAMM. I will comment on it in two ways. First, it amazes me that HMOs are the President's favorite whipping boy today. In 1993, you remember he wanted to put every American in a giant Government-run HMO. The President is not complaining about how much we reimburse HMOs in New York when they are reimbursed twice as much as what they are reimbursed in New Mexico. I wonder why he is not doing that. He says there is something wrong with us trying to help competitive medicine stay in business in rural areas and in States such as New Mexico and in the nonurban areas of States such as Texas. 
   Again, if you listen to the President, it sounds as if he is unhappy that HMOs are getting all this money, but he is not unhappy that the HMOs in New York are being reimbursed at two times the rate of the same HMOs providing the same services in New Mexico. I think what he is saying would have credibility if he were talking about the ones that have high reimbursements. 
   If we were raising reimbursement in New York, he might have a legitimate criticism, but what he is basically saying is we did not spend the money the way he wanted it spent. 
   Our President still does not understand that we have a system of government where we do not serve under the President. We serve with the President. We are a coequal branch of Government, and that means give and take and compromise. It does not mean he can dictate to us. It does not mean that the President is King and he can tell us what to do. 
   This threat that he is going to shut down the FBI and the DEA and the court system if we do not grant amnesty to lawbreakers I think, quite frankly, is an outrageous threat, and I am ready to call his hand on it. It needs to be stopped. I do not think we should encourage any President, Democrat or Republican, to think they can just simply say if you do not take totally extraneous legislation--it does not even have to do with spending money--and put it in this bill, I am going to veto the bill if you do not do that.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank my dear colleague from Texas for her comments on the floor. It seems that our colleague, Senator KENNEDY from Massachusetts, has decided that now he wants to come over daily and tell people how terrible Texas is. I think my dear colleague from Texas has done a very good job answering Senator KENNEDY. But I don't think, quite frankly, the charges need to be answered per se in any other way other than saying that in America, thank God, we have a freedom where people can move. So if Texas were this terrible State that Senator KENNEDY says it is, then we would expect people to be exercising their freedom to move out of Texas and to move to paradise States such as Massachusetts.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Senator KENNEDY would have us believe that Texas is a terrible place. But we can look at what is actually happening in Texas. We created 1.6 million new, permanent, productive, tax-paying jobs for the future since Governor Bush has taken office. This is 50% faster than job growth nationwide. 
   And while the Nation has lost manufacturing jobs, we have created almost 100,000 new manufacturing jobs in Texas under the leadership of Governor Bush. 
   But there is a simple, empirical test as to whether people want to live in a State and what the quality of life is and how good the political leadership is of that State. People vote with their feet. People vote with their feet by leaving places that have bad government and they come to places that have good government. 
   Senator KENNEDY wants us to believe that Texas is this terrible place. The incredible paradox is, consistently now for over 30 years, people have been leaving Massachusetts and moving to Texas. For over 30 years, Texas has exploded in population as Americans have chosen to move there, make their life there, and cast their lot with those who were elected to represent them in Texas. And for over 30 years, people have cast their lot by picking up, packing up their children in the station wagon, and driving out of Massachusetts. It seems to me that is the empirical test. 
   I personally believe that this silly business about attacking States as part of a political campaign doesn't make any sense. I don't know why Senator KENNEDY feels compelled to talk about it. I don't know why he feels compelled to try to attack Texas. The last fellow that tried to attack Texas was General Santa Ana. It did not turn out too well for him. Maybe Senator KENNEDY thinks it is going to turn out better for him than it did for General Santa Ana. 
   I think the message here is not that Massachusetts is a bad place because people are picking up and moving out of it; in fact, it is a very nice place. They have very good people. But they have politicians who have implemented in Massachusetts the program that Al Gore wants to implement in America. They have spent and taxed, spent and taxed, spent and taxed. In the process, every time we take a census, every time we reapportioned representation in the U.S. Congress for the last 30 years, relatively speaking, as compared to the population growth of the country, people have moved out of Massachusetts and moved to Texas. We have gained congressional representation, and Massachusetts has lost congressional representation. 
   I don't think that says that Massachusetts is a bad place. Everything I know about their people, they are wonderful people. But it says something about the key issue in the campaign for President of the United States. It says that when Americans have the right to vote with their feet, they turn their backs on the policies of Al Gore--spend and tax, spend and tax, spend and tax--and they vote with their feet by walking away from those policies. 
   Senator KENNEDY has come over today and yesterday and instead of defending Gore's policies, which no one can defend, he tries to attack Texas. But the plain truth is, the people who have moved out of Massachusetts in the last 30 years have moved because they were rejecting Al Gore's policies of spend and tax that have been implemented in Massachusetts. 
   Here is the problem. If we implemented those policies in America, the policies that have been implemented in Massachusetts and that Al Gore has proposed, with almost $3.3 trillion worth of new Government spending, over 70 massive new Government programs and program expansions, if we adopted those policies in America, where would you move? How would you move with your feet? Who is ready to walk off and leave their country? 
   The problem is, we can vote with our feet to leave Massachusetts and flee bad government and come to Texas. But we can't vote with our feet, we don't want to vote with our feet, to leave America. So again we don't want to leave America, I say to my dear colleague from Utah; we need to turn our back on the policies of tax and spend that have been imposed by politicians in 
   Massachusetts and we need to reject them for America. 
   I have thought it is bad policy and bad form to debate the campaign for  President on the floor of the Senate. But given that Senator KENNEDY is now going to do it every day, apparently, I thought I would take the bait and talk for a moment. 
   When people were listening to the Presidential debates--the Senator from Utah watched them, I know, because we talked about it the next morning--they kept hearing AL GORE say: 1 percent of Americans get all the benefit. They get all these tax cuts. It is the rich people. It is the people against the privileged. And AL GORE is for the people. That is what they heard. 
   Those, by the way, are the same slogans that destroyed ancient Rome and destroyed ancient Athens. And I have to say that AL GORE sounds like a socialist candidate running in a Third World country, to stoop low enough to use that kind of language. 
   I want to explain to people why it is phony. Let me start by talking about AL GORE's record on taxes. Everybody knows he is not for George W. Bush's proposal to cut taxes. We all know that. Let me talk about his record in Congress, and as Vice President, on taxes. How many people know that when Jimmy Carter was President he proposed a tax cut in 1978, that among other things raised the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000 for working families with children, and made the earned-income tax credit permanent. When Jimmy Carter in 1978 said the American people deserve a tax cut and because of inflation--remember, Senator BENNETT, the inflation was in double digits when Jimmy Carter was President--he said we need to raise the personal exemption. What did AL GORE say? It is for the rich. It is for the rich. When you raise the personal exemption from $750 to $1,000, it will help the rich people. So he voted against the tax cut. Apparently, everybody that got a tax cut was rich. 
   Then in 1981 when Ronald Reagan proposed reducing taxes across the board for everybody, taking millions of families off the tax rolls completely, AL GORE thought that was a tax cut for rich people, and so he voted no. 
   Then when we had our effort to reduce the tax burden in 1995, AL GORE again had a chance to support tax cuts, but he supported the veto that killed the bill. 
   Then when we had the Tax Relief Act of 1999, a tax relief that was aimed at repealing the marriage penalty, AL GORE again supported the veto that killed the bill. He believed that if you make $21,800 and you meet another person who makes $21,800 a year and you fall in love and you get married, you become too rich to deserve a tax cut, and you are going to pay on average $1,400 a year to the Federal Government in taxes for the right to be married. 
   Why should you do that? Because AL GORE believes that he can spend that $1,400 better than your family can spend it. So when he had a chance in that tax cut to say yes, he said no. 
   When we passed the marriage penalty repeal, free standing, in the year 2000, he was opposed to it because we actually stretched the tax bracket for couples with each person making $21,925 a year so that they didn't go into the higher, 28 percent tax bracket. But AL GORE thought they were the 1 percent who were privileged and so he supported the President in vetoing the repeal of the marriage tax penalty. 
   Then we passed the death tax repeal. This is a tax that small business people and family farmers pay. They work a lifetime to build up a business or family farm. They scrimp, they sacrifice, they save, and they build up the farm or business. They may not have much cash, but their land, if they are farmers, is worth a lot of money if they sold it. But they don't want to sell it. Their father worked it. They worked it. They want their children to work it. But AL GORE said: No, you are rich. And, besides, if you have to sell your family business, if you have to sell your family farm, it is worth it because the Government can spend this money better than you can spend this money. 
   Now look, here are all of the tax cuts since AL GORE has been a Member of Congress, or Vice President, that have been considered--major tax cuts by the U.S. Congress in all the years since AL GORE came to the House of Representatives. Guess what. He thought every one of these tax cuts was for rich people, because he never voted for a major tax cut. Not once since he came to Congress has he believed, on a major tax bill, that we ought to be cutting taxes. 
   I guess he thought, when we were raising the exemption for children from $750 to $1,000, that all those children were rich. When Reagan cut taxes across the board, took millions of people off the tax rolls, I guess AL GORE thought they were all rich, because he was against it. The point is, he has been against every major tax cut since he has been in public life; every one of them has been a dangerous scheme, to AL GORE. 
   Now that is only part of the story. You see, we have raised taxes since AL GORE has been in Congress. In fact, I have here every major tax increase that has been voted on since AL GORE came to Congress and while he was Vice President. Guess what. One thing you have to give him credit for, he is totally consistent; he has never voted against a major tax increase since he has been in public life. He voted for the major tax increase in 1983, 1984, 1987, in 1990, and 1993, and let me talk briefly about 1993. 
   You heard, if you watched all those debates, that AL GORE wants to tax rich people. He loves capitalism, but he seems to hate capitalists. He loves economic growth, but he seems to hate people who create it. He wants to pit people against each other, so if somebody is creating jobs, you ought to resent them if you are a worker. 
   I do not know about our colleague from Utah, but neither of my parents graduated from high school. No poor person ever hired me in my life. Every job I ever got was from somebody who had a lot more money than I had. I was glad to have the job. Those jobs made it possible for people such as me to be successful in America. But AL GORE supported every major tax increase that has been voted on since he has been in public life--he voted for it. 
   Do you remember the point in the debate where he said: I am proud to have cast the deciding vote on the 1993 Clinton economic program. He did not tell people that that deciding vote was for a gasoline tax increase. The rhetoric of AL GORE and Bill Clinton was their 1993 tax bill only taxed rich people--it did not tax anybody but rich people. But listen to their definition of rich. 
   If you drove a car or a truck in America, you paid a higher gasoline tax, so, by AL GORE's definition, you were rich. If you remember, in the bill that was voted on in the House, that AL GORE supported, it had a Btu tax that would have taxed everybody's utility bills. Guess what. If you have heating or air-conditioning, if you use electricity or heating oil or natural gas, AL GORE believes you are rich, because he said he was only taxing rich people. Yet he supported taxing everybody's utility bill. 
   The final one, which was the ultimate, it seems to me, was the tax on Social Security. You know, it is funny. When you are not in these debates, you watch them on television, and you are brilliant. If you were just there, you would know exactly what to 
   say. It is funny, when you are there, you never quite know what to say. But when AL GORE was talking about Social Security and he was accused of never having done anything about it, he didn't defend himself. But in fact he has done something. AL GORE, in fact, cast the deciding vote on something that profoundly affected Social Security, and that deciding vote was to tax the Social Security benefits of people who make over $25,000 a year--in fact, to tax 85 percent of the benefits of every retiree in America who made over $25,000 a year. 
   Wait a minute. AL GORE said, when he was for this bill, that it only taxed rich people. If you make $25,000 a year and you are drawing Social Security, to AL GORE you are rich. 
   A final thing, and then I will stop. I thought it would be interesting. We heard all this business about who gets AL GORE's tax cut. I decided to do a little experiment. It is a little bit clever--it is not too clever--but here is the basic point. I decided to take a page out of the Washington Post. This is a want ads page of the Washington Post. It is page D11, on Tuesday, October 24. I have reproduced it up here. 
   I went through this list of jobs and asked: Who taking a job in this list would not be too rich to get AL GORE's tax cut? I am not talking about a tax cut you get if you do what AL GORE wants you to do. I am talking about a  cut in your income taxes, where you get to keep more of your money. So follow with me, if you will. This is page D11 of the want ads. Here are all the jobs: From Fairfax Yellow Cab, ``cash daily''; dispatcher; we have here a sports entertainment local branch office for a national sports marketing firm; we have here a newspaper carrier; we have a driver for a warehouse chain--pretty much typical jobs in America. 
   If you go through this and you say, OK, take off every job that was on the want ads page in the Washington Post on Tuesday so that you just leave those jobs that, if you take those jobs, you get AL GORE's tax cut, there it is. 
   Now look. This is page D11 of the Washington Post. These are jobs that are out there right now for people: Landscape foreman and laborer, janitorial; interior design, sales; driver, class A tractor-trailer; drafter, 2 years of experience needed. These are real jobs in the real world. If you took one of these jobs, would you be too rich to get AL GORE's tax cut? When you take all the job ads off that would make you too rich for AL GORE's tax cut, that is what is left. Those are the jobs you could take and you would get AL GORE's tax cut. Here they are: Dry cleaning, pants pressers. 
   You can take a job in Vienna. Let me make it very clear, I am not denigrating these jobs. These are tickets to success in America. Thank God people are creating these jobs. 
   I do not want to go too far in reading it. Here is the point: You could get a job pressing pants, you could get a job as a lifeguard and cleaning a swimming pool, you could get a job as a newspaper carrier, and you could get Al Gore's tax cut. But if you have any of these other jobs--one can see the difference between them--if you got any of those other jobs, you do not get Al Gore's tax cut. I guess this says you are in the 1 percent. That comes as a big surprise to people as to who is rich and who is not rich. 
   I will sum up, make my point, and then yield to Senator BENNETT. 
   Al Gore has served in public life for a long time. In fact, he took pride in it. Look, it is God's work to be involved in public life. The point is, on every tax increase since Al Gore has been in public life, every one of any size or significance, he has voted for every one of them. Every tax cut voted on since Al Gore has been in public life, he has opposed every single major tax cut. 
   He has written a so-called tax cut that 89 percent of the jobs in the Washington Post on page D11 on Tuesday, if you took one of those jobs, your income would be too high to qualify for his tax cut. 
   If you did something he wanted you to do, that there was some kind of favorable tax treatment for, you might get some benefit, but in terms of getting to keep more of your own money to spend, which is what most people call a tax cut, this is what you are down to. 
   Why? Why has Al Gore in his whole public life never voted against a tax increase, never voted for a tax cut, and why does he want to exclude almost anybody who would get any job at random out of the newspaper? Because he believes in his heart that Government can spend the money better in Washington than you can spend it at home. 
   Al Gore is not against married couples. He is not against love. I know he loves his family, and he has a wonderful family. He should love them. But he believes that having working couples in America pay $1,400 a year in a marriage penalty is OK, it is a good thing, it ought not to be repealed, because he believes Government can spend the $1,400 better than they can spend it. 
   He believes it is OK to make people sell the family farm or sell the family business and destroy their parents' life's work and everything their family has worked for in America to give Government 55 cents out of every dollar they earn, not because he does not like small business or does not like family farms, he likes them, but he believes with all of his heart that Government can spend the money better than they can. If you have to sell your family farm and you have to give the life work of your parents and grandparents to the Government, he believes the Government will do the right thing in spending it and you will be better off. 
   If you believe that, your choice in this election is very clear. If you believe that Government, by spending $3.3 trillion on new Government programs, which is what Al Gore has proposed, can make your life better, then you ought to vote for him. If you believe it is not risky to spend $3.3 trillion in Washington but it is risky to give back $1.3 trillion in tax cuts to working Americans, Al Gore is your man. 
   On the other hand, if you believe the Government is probably about as big as it ought to be, if you believe that you can do a better job spending your money than the Government can do, then you probably ought not to vote for Al Gore. You probably ought to vote for George Bush. 
   To tie it all together, what does this have to do with bashing Texas and Massachusetts? It has to do with people who have already made these decisions. Millions of people have moved to Texas 
   because they wanted lower taxes, because they wanted more opportunity, because they wanted to decide. It was not that they hated Government. The Government does a lot of good things. It is they believe they can do things for their family better than the Government can do things for them. 
   Senator KENNEDY does not believe that. He thinks Al Gore is right. He believes we need to spend all this money. He believes we need a bigger Government. His State historically--it has changed; it is getting better, I believe--but historically, his State believed the same thing, which is why so many people moved to Texas, because they were voting for freedom instead of Government. 
   Quite frankly, I would rather we not debate the Presidential campaign on the floor of the Senate, but as long as Senator KENNEDY is going to debate it, I am going to debate it. I want to debate the real issues, and the real issue is, do you want more Government or do you want more opportunity for your family? It is just about as clear as the issue can be clear. 
   Al Gore voted for every tax increase of any significance, against every tax cut of any significance since he has been in public life for one reason: He believes that Government can spend your money better. I do not. George Bush does not. The question is: What does America think? 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me say I have been busy all morning trying to work out our Medicare and Medicaid Improvement Act and work on finalizing actions so we can, hopefully, finish the business of the Senate tomorrow or Friday. I have not had an opportunity to come over, though I understand Senator KENNEDY has gone on at great length talking about Texas. 
   Let me respond in the following way. There are a lot of States in the Union I wouldn't want to live in. But I know there are people who love those States. I am proud when people ask: What State do you represent in the Senate? I am proud I can say I am a Senator from the greatest State in the Union. I am a Senator from Texas. 
   Now, Texas does not need defense against TED KENNEDY. The fact that TED KENNEDY is not for George Bush for President is a very good reason to vote for George Bush for President. The fact that TED KENNEDY does not like our Patients' Bill of Rights in Texas is a pretty good indication we have a good Patients' Bill of Rights in Texas. After all, it was TED KENNEDY who joined the Clintons in proposing that the Government take over and run the health care system in America. 
   I don't have to defend Texas because people vote with their feet. We have had 321,666 people move from other States to Texas since George Bush has been Governor. They must think things are pretty good in Texas. We have created 1.6 million permanent, productive tax-paying jobs for the future in Texas while George Bush has been Governor. While America has lost manufacturing jobs, we have gained 100,000 manufacturing jobs in Texas. Come to think of it, wouldn't it be great if America were a little bit more like Texas? 
   I quote from the rules of the Senate, rule XIX, clause 3: No Senator in debate shall refer offensively to any State of the Union. 
   Now I don't intend to come over and say bad things about Massachusetts. Some great Americans have come from Massachusetts. Massachusetts is a great and wonderful State. I don't choose to live there, but I know the people who live there love it. 
   It is interesting that we are gaining two congressional seats because so many people are moving to Texas; Massachusetts keeps losing congressional seats. But I am not going to come out here and criticize Massachusetts. 
   I say to Senator KENNEDY and to others: if you want to run for President, you want to campaign, go out and do it. But I don't think we ought to turn the floor of the Senate into the fulcrum of that campaign. 
   I thank my colleague for coming over. She does a great job in defending Texas and defending its interests. I am always proud to be associated with her. Texas doesn't need any defending. But obviously the rules of the Senate do. I call on my colleagues to abide by the rules. I don't think we help each other if we try to tear down other people's States. I think it behooves us to try to build up our own States--to try to build up our own country. I think when we do that, the country benefits. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I want to talk about a series of issues that are related to the final things with which we have to deal in ending this Congress. It is not a long list, but it is a list of things that are important. I hope my colleagues will indulge me while I talk about these issues. 
   I read this morning in the New York Times, under the headline ``Leaders in Congress Agree to Debt Relief for Poor Nations,'' that an agreement has been worked out on debt relief. I want to make it clear that I am not part of any such agreement. I hope an agreement will be worked out, and I would like to be part of an agreement. But I am not part of any agreement today. 
   It is important, since so much has been said and written on this issue, that someone on the other side stand up and explain what this issue is about, why it is important, and why people all over America ought to be concerned about it and be concerned that it be done right. 
   I remind my colleagues and those who might be listening to this discussion that routinely in America people borrow money and are required to repay it. Where I am from, College Station, TX, it is a pretty hard sell to talk about forgiving billions of dollars of debt to countries that borrowed money from us and, in too many cases, simply squandered or stole it, and now they do not want to repay it. They riot, they protest, they demand, but those things do not work in College Station, TX. In College Station, TX, when you borrow money from the bank or finance company or from your brother-in-law, you are expected to pay it back. 
   Let me make it clear that I am not here to make the most negative case that can be made about debt forgiveness. The flip side of the coin is that  many of these countries are desperately poor, and much of this debt can never be repaid. So the debate I want to engage in today is not against debt relief, as hard a sell as that is back home--and I am willing to make that sale or try to--but I am not willing to support debt relief unless we are going to have some reforms to assure that the money is not wasted. 
   I remind my colleagues, while we talk about debt relief, we are actually appropriating over $450 million because we are paying off this debt. Our money was lent and was largely squandered, and now it is going to be used to pay off this debt. 
   So, I am concerned because of the lack of accountability in how the money is being spent. Any Member of Congress knows this is an issue in which a great deal of interest has been taken. 
   I had a group of holy people come to my office the other day to lobby for this debt forgiveness. I do not think since Constantine the Great called his ecumenical council in Nicaea has there been a larger gathering of holy people in one place than the people who came to see me about supporting debt forgiveness. 
   And let me quickly add that everybody who came was well intentioned. Their hearts were in the right place. But the problem is not with our hearts; the problem is with our heads. Obviously, in this 2000th year of Christianity--this 2000th year of the birth of Christ--there is a movement all over the world to try to help the poor. But the question is, In forgiving this debt, are we really assuring that the money that we are giving is getting through to the people we are trying to help? And I think that is basically where the problem lies. 
   Let me now talk about a couple of examples that illustrates this problem. I want to read from four newspaper articles that outline a story, in my opinion, of how this debt forgiveness is abused and how our taxpayer ends up holding the bag. 
   The first story is from Africa News, July 23, 2000, and is from Kampala, Uganda--one of the initial countries targeted for debt relief.  
   In March Parliament there approved the direct procurement of a new 12-seat presidential Gulf Stream GIV Special Performance SP jet at a cost of $31.5 million. Aviation experts said that the final cost of the plane could well be $47 million. 
   The current presidential jet is a 9-seater Gulf Stream III acquired just a few years ago.  
   Now, from the August 2, 2000, issue of the Financial Times in London, I quote:  
   The Group of Seven leading industrialized countries is pressing the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to stop export credits being used to help poor countries buy arms and other ``nonproductive'' items. 
   Although the OECD cannot impose binding rules, the U.S. and Britain, leaders of the G7 initiative, believe ``naming and shaming'' dubious policies could create pressure to get them changed and prevent poor countries from squandering debt relief.  
   This article is from August 2, and on July 23 we learned that the Ugandan President has bought a new $47 million plane for his use. And we are naming and shaming, along with the British in the Financial Times. 
   And now on September 13, 2000, in Africa News, Kampala:  
   The Paris Club of creditor countries yesterday cancelled $145 million of Uganda's debt under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. 
   Tuesday's Paris Club announcement brings Uganda's total debt relief from the lending countries so far to $656 million. Uganda has also received $1.3 billion debt relief pledges from the IMF and World Bank in debt relief over the next 25 years.  
   So on July 23, which turns out to be the day that debt forgiveness was announced for Uganda, the President of Uganda buys himself a new $47 million luxury jet. And on August 2 we are naming and shaming people who are abusing debt forgiveness dollars that come from American taxpayers. And then on September 13 it is announced that we have forgiven this debt, raising the total to $656 million for Uganda, the same country whose President on the day the debt forgiveness package was announced ordered a $47 million jet. 
   Now, the final quote on this point is from the Wall Street Journal, dated October 12, 2000:  
   On the day that Uganda qualified for debt forgiveness under the Clinton initiative, the president of that struggling African nation signed a $32 million lease-purchase agreement for a brand-new Gulf Stream jet.  
   It goes on to say that we have been assured by the administration that he got a pretty good buy on the jet. 
   Now, I ask my colleagues, when we are talking about this debt forgiveness, should we be forgiving debt with the idea that it is going to help poor people in Uganda when the President of Uganda, on the day the debt relief is announced, buys a $47 million jet? 
   Maybe you can go to College Station and sell that, but I cannot. And I am not going to. 
   Let me go to the next point. All of the people who have written or called me, launched letters and sent calls and prayers and e-mails on this issue, say: We are trying to help people in these poor countries; don't stand in the way; forgive this debt, which I remind my colleagues means appropriating money to pay off the debt on their behalf. 
   The next country I want to talk about is Chad. This is a country that is next on the list to receive debt forgiveness. The argument is that by forgiving Chad's debt, we are going to help poor people who live there. But let me read from this year's U.S. State Department ``Report on Human Rights Violations'' in Chad, a country that the administration is pressuring us to appropriate tax money for so he can forgive their debt. This is from the State Department issued under the name of the Secretary of State, who was appointed by President Clinton, not by me. This is what she says about Chad, a country on the list of countries that would receive debt forgiveness if we provide this $450 million. I quote:  
   The security forces---  
   This is in Chad---  
   continue to commit serious human rights abuses. State security forces continue to commit extrajudicial killings. They torture, beat, abuse and rape.  
   Now, I ask my colleagues--and I ask public opinion--does it make sense for us to appropriate $450 million to forgive debt to a country when our own State Department, headed by the Secretary appointed by the same President who champions this debt forgiveness, tells us, ``State security forces continue to commit extrajudicial killings; they torture, beat, abuse, and rape''? 
   Maybe you can go to College Station or Little Rock or Jackson Hole, WY, and sell that. I cannot. 
   What we are facing is this: Based on good intentions, we want to forgive this debt, but what happens when there is clear and convincing evidence that the proceeds of the debt forgiveness are going to buy luxury jets for Government officials? 
   And in Chad, remember that the ordinary citizens there did not borrow this money, this was a loan to the Government. So are we going to forgive debts to a government that, according to our very own State Department, continues to murder, brutalize, and rape its own people? I don't think so. 
   Having said all of that, what is the solution to this problem? It seems to me that if this administration is serious about doing something other than what it believes will be good politics in this election, or something that will make us all feel good--forgiving all of this debt--what we have to do is try to replicate what happens in every American family when people have financial problems. 
   So, what happens in Arkansas, Texas or anywhere in America, when the bill collector comes knocking at the door? What happens is that families get together around the kitchen table, they get out a pencil and try to figure out on the back of an envelope how much they are making and how much they are spending. They get out their credit cards, they get out the butcher knife, and they cut up their credit cards, and they try to reorganize. They change their habits and their behavior. 
   It seems to me, when we are talking about forgiving billions of dollars of debt to governments--these loans were made to governments, not to people--when we are forgiving that debt, we have a right--in fact, I would say an obligation--to see that that debt forgiveness benefits the people who live in that country. These countries are not poor because of this debt. They are poor because they have oppressive governments, because they have economic policies that do not work, because they are denied freedom. The sad story is  that if we forgive this debt, and we do not demand real reforms, nothing will change. This great opportunity to do something good for poor people in the world will be lost. 
   In trying to work with the administration--and I would have to say that, in theory, there is a lot of agreement with the administration--but when it comes time to put the requirements into place, that is where we cannot seem to work this issue out. The administration does not contradict its own State Department report on rampant human rights abuses. But when we're trying to set requirements for getting this debt forgiveness, that is where the administration says no. 
   I have tried to reduce the requirements that I think the conscience of the Senate should require to some very simple things. And I just ask people who might be listening to what I am saying to ask yourself: Are these unreasonable requirements in return for billions of dollars of taxpayer money? 
   Let me remind my colleagues, I know there is a drunkenness that has come from this big surplus. Never in my political career have I seen money squandered as it is in our Government this very minute, even as I am speaking right now. It is frightening to me. But even in this moment of a huge surplus, surely everybody realizes and remembers that, for every dollar we get, every dollar we spend, somebody worked hard to earn that money. 
   I believe that money ought to be respected. So in return for billions of dollars of the American taxpayers' money, here are the conditions to which I have asked the administration to agree. 
   No. 1, we cannot forgive debt for a country that we find in our most recent human rights evaluation engages in a gross violation of human rights against its own people. In other words, what we would say to the government of Chad is: If you want this debt forgiven, then you have to quit killing, abusing, and raping your people. And if you do not do that, we are not going to forgive the debt. That is condition No. 1. 
   I do not view that as unreasonable. Quite frankly, I would be ashamed to have my name affixed on a voting list to the forgiveness of this debt if we gave it to murderers, thugs, and rapists. 
   The second condition has to do with the fact that these countries are poor because they are basically practicing socialism. They deny property rights and economic freedom, and, as a result, they are poor. 
   We sometimes get the idea that because socialism does not work economically, that it is dying. But socialism works politically, which is why it is alive all over the world and why it is debated in Washington, DC. 
   Now, here are three economic conditions that, at a minimum, I believe we need. First of all, if countries are going to take our money, they should be required to open their markets to meet the requirements of the World Trade Organization so that we have an opportunity to sell American goods in their economy, and so that their workers have a right to buy goods competitively, instead of being forced to buy expensive, inferior goods from a government-run monopoly. 
   We have one of the most open economies in the world. We are the richest, freest, happiest people in this world. Asking those who are getting debt relief to do something that will help them is, I think, something that is required. It is something that must be done. 
   Secondly, they would be required to set up a series of benchmarks, not just on opening up their economy, but also in those countries where government dominates the market, where huge numbers of people work for the government, and, in essence, the government runs everything, we would require, in return for the loan forgiveness, that they set up benchmarks for phasing out subsidies to these government-run enterprises. 
   The third requirement is simply that in printing their financial and government records on how much money they are spending, how much they are taking in in taxes, how much they are borrowing, that we have transparency so that we and investors can know what is going on in the country and so that we can see whether they are taking actions that will actually improve the life of their people. And that would include transparency in their financial institutions and their banks. 
   What this would say is, we do not forgive money until these conditions are in place. And if at any point along the way countries do not live up to these commitments, then we stop the debt forgiveness. 
   Some people think these are outrageous conditions. But I just simply go back to College Station. When you have a line of credit with a bank, and you have told them you are using this line of credit to invest in your restaurant, and it turns out you bought a car for private use, they cut off your line of credit. When you do not tell the truth, you end up losing your line of credit. 
   So I just want to urge, publicly, the administration to help Congress put together a program that will take this debt forgiveness and put it to work to help ordinary working people. If we do not do something like this, we are going to end up seeing this money spent on jet planes for government leaders; we are going to see the benefits of debt forgiveness go to the leadership elite; and 10 or 15 years from now, when these same countries have the same debt crisis, we will have someone like President Clinton who will be arguing that we could just fix all this if we just forgive this debt. 
   I am willing to go along with the debt forgiveness. I am willing to go home and try to explain to people why these governments are treated better than citizens here are treated if I know the money is not going to be squandered or stolen or used to abuse the very people we are trying to help. But I intend to fight--and fight hard--to see that we do not take billions of dollars from American taxpayers to give to buy fancy airplanes for government officials, and that we do not use it to basically subsidize corruption and the abuse of the very people we are trying to help.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, a second topic I rise to talk briefly about is the issue of amnesty. The White House sent a letter dated October 12, 2000 to Congress which in many ways is one of the most extraordinary letters I have ever seen a President send to Congress. This letter, basically says the President will veto the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill unless we grant amnesty to people who have violated our laws by coming to this country illegally. In other words, the President is threatening that he will veto a bill that funds DEA--the Drug Enforcement Administration--the FBI, the Federal prison system, our system of criminal and civil justice, he will veto that bill unless we in Congress grant amnesty to people who have broken the law by coming to the United States of America illegally. 
   It is one thing for the President, functioning under the Constitution, to say: You have your idea about how much money should be spent. I have my idea. I don't think you are spending enough. That is what the President is saying every day. The President is threatening to veto appropriation after appropriation because he doesn't think we are spending enough. We are spending faster than we have ever spent since Lyndon Johnson was President of the United States, yet we are not spending enough money to suit President Clinton. 
   You can argue that he is wrong, that it is dangerous, that one of the reasons the stock market is in shock today is this runaway Federal spending that endangers our economy and our prosperity, but it is a legitimate issue to be debating on an appropriations bill, how much money we spend. 
   The President just happens to be wrong--dangerously wrong, in my opinion--and I am not going to support him. But that is one thing. 
   But to say that unless we pass a law that has nothing to do with spending money, that forgives lawbreakers who came into this country illegally, he is going to veto a bill that funds the FBI, the DEA, and the criminal justice system is an outrageous assertion of Presidential power. Our President has been so successful in manipulating the Congress, he has forgotten that we have a separation of powers in America. He is going to get reminded in this debate. 
   I don't want to get too deeply into the amnesty issue, but I will say a couple things about it. First of all, as the Presiding Officer knows, as anyone in  the Senate knows, if there has been one Member who has been a champion of legal immigration, it is I. I have stood on the floor many times arguing for letting people with a desire to work hard, with talent, genius, creativity, and big dreams into America and to let them come legally. I am proud of the fact that my wife's grandfather came to America as an indentured laborer to work in the sugarcane fields in Hawaii. 
   I have spoken previously on this issue at great length. One of the most successful employees I ever had was a young man named Rohit Kumar. The Senate was debating an increase in the quota for legal immigration, if I remember correctly. I talked about the Kumars. His daddy is a research doctor. His mama is a physician. His uncle is an engineer, an architect. The point I made was, America needs more Kumars. 
   I am sure when you are talking about amnesty, there are going to be those who will say this has something to do with being against foreigners. Well, I don't believe America is full. I was the cosponsor of the H-1B program that will let 200,000 highly skilled technical people--most of them in graduate school in America right now, being funded by our taxpayers--stay temporarily to help us keep the economy strong. But I draw the line on illegal immigration. I draw the line when it comes to breaking the laws of this country. 
   I believe if we keep granting amnesty to people who came to 
   the country illegally, we are in essence putting up a neon sign on all of our borders saying: Violate our law; come into the country illegally. Then we will later pass laws making it all right and you will be able to stay. 
   I am not for that. I am adamantly opposed to it. Millions of people today are on waiting lists to come to America legally. They are often the wives or husbands of people who have come here and become permanent resident aliens. I am in favor of family unification where someone has come here, they are self-sustaining, they haven't received public assistance within a year, and they show the financial ability to take care of their spouse and children. I say let them come to America. But I draw the line on illegal immigration. 
   We have somewhere between 5 and 7 million people who have come to America illegally. When we passed the immigration bill in 1986, we granted amnesty to people who were here illegally. That was supposed to be it. Yet now the Clinton administration says they are going to shut down the DEA and FBI and the criminal justice system unless we grant amnesty to more people. We are getting this sort of bait and switch, for which the administration is famous. 
   I am sure you have heard the argument. There is a claim that there were some aliens here in 1986 who claim they were unfairly denied amnesty and we should now go back and let them qualify. These are the facts: Most didn't qualify for amnesty because the original law, which was going to be the first and last amnesty ever granted to lawbreakers in American history--that was the commitment made here on the floor of the Senate--was for people who could document that they resided here prior to 1982. Now the Clinton administration is saying there were people here when we passed amnesty, who did not get amnesty, and that is unfair, and let's do it for everyone here prior to 1986. I suppose then we can do it up to 1996. We can do this rolling amnesty which, again, simply puts a neon sign along our border which says: Violate America's law; come here illegally. 
   I don't know what the President is going to do. Maybe he is going to veto Commerce-Justice-State. Maybe he is going to try to shut down the DEA and the FBI, and maybe he is going to try to find somebody to blame. Let me give him a name: PHIL GRAMM. 
   It may well be that the President can pass this amnesty provision. It may very well be that he has the political power to force us to grant amnesty to lawbreakers in return for funding Commerce-State-Justice. I want to go on record here and say, I will not make it easy. Any conference report that comes up that has amnesty in it, I am going to offer motions to postpone, to delay, and attempt to force cloture. That is going to take 3 days. Then we are going to have 30 hours of debate, which is going to take another day and a half. Then you are going to do cloture on the conference report itself, and that is going to take another 3 days. Then we are going to have 30 hours of debate on that conference report which is going to take another day. 
   Bill Clinton is the one moving to New York or Arkansas--I guess the location to be determined by the outcome of the election. I am not going anywhere. I am going to be here next year. Amnesty may pass. We may basically say: Forget about American laws. You come here, violate them; we will just forget it. But it is not going to pass without determined resistance. 
   I want my colleagues to know that when we are sitting here on election day and there is an effort to pass amnesty, it is not as if people hadn't been told that this was going to be resisted. This is profoundly wrong. This is dangerous for the future of our country. It needs to be stopped.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I had the responsibility in working with the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee to try to work out our differences with the House on the Medicare give-back. 
   We passed a bill in 1997 that was aimed at trying to balance the budget and trying to save Medicare. We succeeded in balancing the budget. We have been in the process since that day of trying to undo everything we did. We have put together a package that costs over $27 billion in Medicare give-backs. About half the package is totally deserved and desperately needed. About half the package in my opinion--I am speaking just for myself--represents things that are bad public policy, and it is being done for one simple reason: We have the money. Why not spend it? 
   I am not going to go down a long list. But let me give you one example--bad debt forgiveness. 
   Believe it or not, this bill has a provision that says to hospitals, if you don't collect your bad debt--remember, Medicaid pays for health care for poor people. We have two provisions of Medicare that provide taxpayer assistance above Medicaid for very marginal income people who are not poor but they have difficulty paying their bills. 
   When we are talking about bad debt, we are talking about bad-debt incurred by people who didn't qualify for Medicaid. 
   We have a provision in this bill where the taxpayer will simply come in and pick up 70 percent-plus of bad debt costs for hospitals. Collecting debt is difficult. Ask any retail merchant, or ask anybody who is in business in America. They will tell you it is hard to collect debt. 
   What do you think is going to happen when the taxpayer pays 70 percent of the debt that hospitals don't want to collect and that people do not want to pay? They are going to stop collecting. People are going to stop paying, and the taxpayer is going to pay. 
   To get to the bottom line on this issue, the President says: Look, you didn't spend enough money on the things I wanted it spent on, and I am going to veto this $27 billion give-back. 
   I hope the President does veto it. I think about half of it is justified. I think we could have done it for $15 billion, and could have done a reasonably good job. 
   But my own view is that if the President vetoes it--we are just moments now from an election. We are going to have a new President. My suggestion is, if the President vetoes this bill, that we simply wait until January for a new President--hopefully, someone who will be more responsible than this President--and we will take a very serious look at Medicare. 
   In this bill, with spending of $27 billion, we could not find one penny of savings to put in the bill. There is not one thing currently being done in America in health care, including a new scam by States where they simply overcharge the Federal Government and pocket part of the difference--we could not find one thing on which we could save money. I find that difficult to sell. 
   Finally, there was an article in today's Washington Post by David Broder. I don't always agree with David Broder, but I always think about what he has to say. I guess if you want to define a serious commentator and set it out in a column, you would have to put David Broder's name at the top  of that list. You may not like what he says about you. You may not like what he says about your view. But he doesn't say anything that he doesn't think about. I admire that. 
   He points out today in an article that says ``So Long, Surplus'' that we are currently--this year--on the verge of spending $100 billion more than we said we would spend this year when we adopted the much touted Balanced Budget Act in 1997, which Bill Clinton signed. This wasn't just Congress, this was Congress and the President. We are on the verge of spending $100 billion this year more than we said we were going to spend. 
   I just want to say that someday people are going to ask: What happened to this surplus? They are going to ask: Why didn't we rebuild Medicare? Why didn't we rebuild Social Security by putting real assets into Social Security--not taking anything out of Social Security but putting real assets into Social Security--by taking this money and investing it in stocks, bonds, and real assets so we have something to pay benefits with in the future? 
   Someday someone is going to ask: What happened to that surplus? Why couldn't we, when tax rates were at the highest level in American history, have some tax relief for working families? Why did we have to keep forcing people to sell the farm or business in order to pay the Government a death tax? Why did we have to tax marriage and love in the marriage tax penalty? 
   Someday somebody is going to ask those questions. I just want to be on record saying I think it is outrageous that we are doing this. I think we need to stop doing this. 
   I read in the paper where the President said he is like the Buddha. He is like Buddha. He just sits and waits and waits, and Congress wants to go home, and the only way they are going to go home is to spend all of this money. 
   I repeat that I am not going anywhere. President Clinton's number of days as President is now short. 
   My point is that we have a right to say no. We have a right to say in education when we have spent every penny the President said he wanted but we want to let States decide how to spend the money--we want to give them the same money, but we want them to decide how to spend it, and President Clinton says: No. I am going to veto your bill because I want to tell States how to spend it. 
   I think we have an obligation to say no. If people need schools, they can take the money and build schools. If they need more teachers, they can take the money and hire more teachers. But if they need other things, they can take the money and do that, because they know their needs better than Bill Clinton. 
   But that is not what the President wants. We spent every penny he asked for--too much money, in my opinion. But he said he is going to veto that bill because we give the States the ability to decide what they need to spend the money on. 
   My answer to that is, let him veto it, and then we can pass a continuing resolution. Let's have an election. If people want to spend this surplus, if they want to spend it on program after program after program, if they want more government and less freedom, they know how to vote in this election. If you want the Government to spend more, and if you want this surplus to be spent on government programs, you know how to vote. 
   But we ought not to let Bill Clinton spend the money before the American people vote for more spending. First, I don't think they are going to do it; but, second, that is what elections are about. 
   I think we have to quit kowtowing to the President. If he wants to force us to stay here and pass these bills day after day after day, if I were running for reelection and were in a close race, I would go home and campaign. But for the 60-some-plus of us who are not up for reelection, let's just stay here in town. And if the President suddenly becomes reasonable, we will reach an agreement. But if he is going to play Budhha, to quote him, and sit there and see if it will work one more time--that is, if by threatening to hold us in session he can get us to spend more money than our budget and more money than his budget--he wants to see if it will work one more time, 
   I want to say no. I think the American people would rejoice in it. 
   I am hopeful my fellow colleagues will come to the conclusion that the President is asking too high a price to see this session of Congress end. Too much money. Too much change in permanent law that does not represent the will of the American people. I think we need to say no. The sooner we say no, the sooner the President will come to his senses. And he will for a simple reason: He is not holding a strong hand here. He is the one moving off. We are not moving anywhere. 
   I think we can come to a compromise with the President, but I think we ought to be tired of being run over. I say we should not spend more money simply to get out of town. To do that would basically betray everything we claim to believe in and betrays the people who are going to pay our salary, whether we are in town or not. 
   I thank my colleagues for their indulgence, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am stunned that we are talking about fiscal discipline and asking whether a bill is over the budget when we have a bill before us where we set out funds in the budget knowing that this was a problem that needed to be dealt with. We set out $400 million in the budget to try to begin to deal with this problem. The bill before us creates a brand new program never debated anywhere and which no Member of this Senate can really explain how it will work. It has never been tested anywhere. It will cost $59.9 billion. 
   Let me quote from Senator WARNER's letter and his initial cost estimate, which is now out of date because additional benefits were added to this bill. But let me quote from his letter of September 27. ``The cost of this proposal is scored by the Congressional Budget Office at $42.4 billion in mandatory spending over 10 years.'' That has now risen to $59.9 billion. ``In addition, the Treasury would accept a $200 billion liability that would be amortized over 70 years.'' 
   Not only is this bill a budget buster--it will win the blue ribbon in Congress this year. There will be no bill in this Congress that will approach this bill in terms of fiscal irresponsibility and lack of financial discipline. And all of this was done not in a committee, not in a public debate, but by a group of conferees who got together in closed sessions. The House entered that conference with a program that cost $945 million. The Senate went into the conference with a program that cost $466 million. They came out of conference with a program that cost $60 billion, and committed us to a 70-year debt of $200 billion. 
   I believe there is no parallel in the history of appropriations and authorizations in America to the bill before us in terms of a bill which has never been debated and a program that has never been discussed. 
   Let me make a couple of points. 
   First of all, it is obvious that all of us here tonight should praise our dear colleague, Senator KERREY, who is retiring. You can get a lot of praise around here by dying or retiring. Given the choice between the two, he has chosen the right one. 
   Let me say that many people have congratulated Senator KERREY for his physical courage. I don't know much about that type of courage. So far as I know, nobody has ever shot at me. Nor do I have any reason to believe I would have been shot at. I don't know much about that kind of courage. 
   But there is a different kind of courage that I know a little bit about. It is a courage that has to do with standing up to peer group pressure. There is something very human about the fact that somewhere around the first or second grade we start caring terribly about what people around us think. It is something we never escape from until they lower us in the grave. One would think grown men and women, Members of the Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the history of the world, would be immune to it. But as my colleagues know, we are not immune to it. We want to be loved. We want to be accepted by our colleagues. You don't get love by opposing this giant expenditure of money. You don't get appreciated by your colleagues by standing up to it. Senator KERREY is getting a lot of praise tonight. My guess is when the votes are counted, we may have three votes to sustain this point of order. But I don't know. I wasn't there when Senator KERREY won the Congressional Medal of Honor, but I was there when he stood up in this Congress and pointed out to America and to this Congress that the largest federal entitlement programs tax young working people who are just starting out, and give that money to seniors, many of whom have built up retirement savings over a lifetime. 
   And it's being done because older people vote and younger people don't vote. We are digging a hole in Medicare and Social Security that can destroy America and that will destroy our prosperity if we don't do something about it. 
   The Senator from Nebraska has been a leader in that and I want to say I appreciate it. I believe America does, but America is not embodied in the way it can speak and, since it hasn't been elected, it couldn't speak on the floor of the Senate anyway. On behalf of working people in my State and my country, I thank you, BOB KERREY. I'm sorry you are retiring. I want to thank you for what you have said and what you have stood up for. 
   Now, let me try to put all this in perspective. First of all, I agree with Senator WARNER's poster. I hope my colleagues will forgive me because I want to give a little bit of history to establish my bona fides on this issue, if I can. 
   First, my dad was a career soldier. He joined the Army on his 15th birthday in his brother's clothes. He was in the Army for 28 years, 7 months, and 27 days. He believed when he joined the Army that part of what the Government had committed to him was that if he served for 20 or more years, they were going to take care of him and his family and their health care needs. I am proud to say--and I say it with certainty because I know; I was born in the same hospital my dad died in, and it was a military hospital at Ft. Benning, GA--the Government never, ever took that benefit away from my dad. 
   We are here today for two reasons. We are here in part because the policies of our Government changed. They changed in a remarkable way, and it is an interesting thing how benefits are lost. They changed because Medicare was going broke. So our government  made everybody join Medicare, including men and women in the Armed Services. This problem came about because people who retired from the service qualified for two medical programs: One, by paying Medicare taxes; and two, by serving 20 or more years. The military health care benefit was a right not to Medigap insurance or any of the things we are talking about today, it was a right to go to a military hospital on a space-available basis and get military medicine. 
   What happened--which was terribly wrong, in my opinion--is that, in the midst of a period of very tight budgets, the military gave retirees their military health benefit until they turned 65 when they became qualified for Medicare. As they got close to their 65th birthday--I know this because I have a brother who is a career soldier. I don't know whether he likes military medicine because they know his name--``Colonel.'' He goes to a regular hospital and they call him ``Mister'' although, obviously, they don't know who he is. They don't know anything about him. So I don't know whether it is that or whether he just is comfortable with having been a career soldier and having served in the Army for some 27 years--the point is, as he gets closer to 65, under the current system he will get a sheet when he goes in, and members of the staff know this, he will get a referral sheet. And they will say, ``Colonel, you are going to turn 65 in August. So these are the medical areas that we are aware of that are relevant to you, and these are private practitioners in Dallas, Texas, that you can go to under Medicare.'' 
   Here is a person who got military medicine on active duty for 27 years, and then he retired and continued to get it up to the day he was 65, but because he earned two benefits, they shoved him out the door when he turned 65. 
   My disagreement with Senator WARNER is not about that recruiting poster. I believe that poster is true. And I believe the benefit is owed. Where we split company is on what we are doing here tonight. 
   Let me explain. Just to complete the history, because I felt that I had some personal knowledge about this problem, I was the leader in Congress in putting together a test program called 
   Medicare Subvention. The idea was simple. A lot of simple ideas don't work. It is not clear how well this one is working. In some ways, I think it is working well although costs are up because utilization is up. But the basic idea was simple. Let's pick ten facilities in America that have big retirement populations near them and let people stay in military medicine and let Medicare pay what they would pay had they gone to the private sector. We are in the midst of a test of that program right now. 
   Earlier this year, while Medicare Subvention was still being tested, this bill came up, and while we were debating military retiree health care, a proposal was made to spend $92 billion. Senator DOMENICI will remember that. That proposal failed. And it should have. I voted against it. 
   During that debate, Senator WARNER offered a 2-year program to build on the test that we had underway. Senator WARNER's program cost $466 million. I supported it. In fact, I think all the rest of us supported it. I am not sure Senator KERREY did, but I think Senator DOMENICI supported it. 
   The Senate had put in the budget enough money that to try Senator WARNER's program out for 2 years. Why was it important to do it in 2 years? I will talk about the money, but let me talk about the policy. What is wrong with committing to $60 billion worth of new programs that have never been debated, never been tested, and committing to a $200 billion liability over the next 70 years? What is wrong is, as anybody who has ever served in public office knows, once this program is in place, a vested political interest will build up around it in the medical sector, in the retirement sector, and in the communities where it is provided. What happens is even if this program doesn't work, even if it is terribly inefficient, even if people are unhappy with it, the chances of ever getting rid of it or fundamentally changing it are very low. 
   We have in Medicare, as Senator KERREY, better than anyone else knows having served on the Medicare Commission, we have a 1965 medical care system. In Medicare, we have an old Edsel. Yet we can't change it. We tried to change it on the Medicare Commission as the Senator remembers. But the vested interest in it, even though it is inefficient, even though it doesn't serve the public well, even though it costs tremendous amounts of money, once it is in place, it is hard to change. 
   Here is the point. The first problem with this huge program is that was never debated, never discussed, and was written by a handful of people that, quite frankly, are very intelligent people, very knowledgeable people about defense. As far as I am aware, it was never discussed in the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare. It was never debated in any public forum. It has never been tested anywhere. The point is, tonight on the verge of adjournment, we are getting ready to commit $60 billion in spending on a program that may or may not work, may or may not satisfy people, and which is going to be virtually irreversible. 
   The second point I want to make is the House went into conference with a program that extended the Medicare Subvention demonstration, made it permanent within 6 years, and costs $945 million. So the Senate went to conference with a temporary program of $466 million to build on a concept, that basically, we had started in the test; 
   and the other House of Congress went with a program that made a judgment to move toward full implementation of the test, and it cost $945 million. But what happened? 
   What happened--and Senator KERREY was making the point, I thought very effectively--they got to conference and suddenly somebody said, ``The sky's the limit. We have a huge surplus. This is an election year.'' So what happened is one House, with a program for $466 million, and the other House, with a program for $945 million, got together and suddenly we have a $60 billion entitlement program. Actually the new program is $39 billion, but the committee just gratuitously took existing health care programs and said let's just put $21 billion on automatic pilot in a permanent entitlement program so we do not have to account for spending it. 
   That is what happened. Why did it happen? Because the surplus is burning a hole in our pocket. This surplus is the greatest danger we face in terms of our economic stability--not just now, but 10 or 12 years from now when the baby boomers start to retire. It is not just happening here. I am not just being mean to our dear friends on the Armed Services Committee, a committee I had the privilege to serve on for 6 years. It is happening everywhere. 
   We have a railroad retirement proposal that lowers the retirement age. We are raising the retirement age in Social Security. Yet, we would lower it in railroad retirement. We have a proposal to give Amtrak $10 billion. 
   We have proposals--we are giving back Medicare savings that we have previously adopted at a rate where, in 10 years, we will have given back more than we ever had in savings, yet Medicare is going broke every day. What is happening to us? What is happening to us is this surplus is affecting our judgment and we are spending it as fast as we can spend it. 
   Let me sum up. I want to make a point about the economy, one I had not thought of until I was talking to Alan Greenspan today, and I want to bring it up because I think it is relevant. 
   What is my position? My position is we do have an obligation to military retirees and we have to find a way to fix the health care system for military retirees. But I think we need to do it so we know what we are doing, so we know what it costs, so we know it is going to be efficient, and we have to do it after there has been a clear, effective, public debate and where we have actually tested the program so we know what we are doing. 
   The problem here is this bill is immensely popular, as my colleagues know if any of you have paid any attention to your telephone calls today, but it is popular because we are spending massive amounts of money. 
   My point is I do not disagree with Senator WARNER. We owe these benefits, and we are going to have to provide a way for our military retirees to have quality medical care, which we promised. But the idea of doing it by busting the budget by $59.9 billion on a  program nobody ever debated, nobody ever tested, nobody has ever seen work, I think is clearly the wrong way to do it. 
   We have a point of order that is going to be raised by Senator KERREY. What is the point of order about?

   Mr. GRAMM. Well, he has raised it. What it is about is, in our budget we agreed we were going to spend $400 million to begin to try to fix this problem. The committee with jurisdiction to fix it was not willing to abide by that budget, and they came up with a program that did not cost $400 million, they came up with a program that cost $59.9 billion and committed us to a $200 billion debt to be amortized over 70 years. 
   So Senator KERREY has raised a point of order saying: This may be wonderful, this might actually be the right thing to do someday, but this violates what we voted to do and the constraints we imposed on ourselves. 
   I do not suffer any delusion. My guess is we are going to get 3 or 4 or 5--maybe 10 votes here. We are going to waive this point of order, and we are going to spend this $60 billion. We are going to spend it on a program which was never debated, never tested, never analyzed in any systematic way. My fear is that we are going to have a very difficult time fixing it. I am afraid 10 years from now we may be here debating how we can fix it, but with the vested interests that have built up, it will be very difficult to do. 
   So I believe this point of order should be sustained. I am going to vote to sustain it. 
   Why should we care about this spending? I was talking to Chairman Greenspan today about the economy and about the stock market. We were talking about spending. I basically had raised the issue with him, was he worried about this runaway spending? He made a point to me that, in April and May, something clearly started happening because long-term interest rates started going up in America. Some people say that is caused by Fed policy. No, the policy of the Fed, as our colleagues know, affects short-term interest rates. But the economy affects long-term interest rates. 
   Let me tell you what was happening in May. What was happening in May is it started to become clear we were not going to abide by our budget. It started to become clear we were losing control of spending. These long-term rates went up and the economy started to cool, and that is being reflected in the stock market today, in my opinion. 
   I am not saying we are going into a recession. But I am saying the interest rates went up on the long-term because we are losing control of spending. We are losing fiscal discipline. They went up until the economy slowed down enough that they started to back off. 
   I think we ought to be concerned about spending this surplus. I think we need to make rational decisions about it. It may very well be, after a debate, we write a budget and we spend $60 billion on this problem. I do not think I would do it this way. I think we need efficiency, I think we need copayments, I think we need incentives for cost consciousness. I don't think I would support doing it this way, but I might support a program that costs this much, more or less. 
   But doing it this way, where two or three people put together this proposal, is fundamentally wrong and is dangerous. This is a noble cause, and a cause that I support--military retirees were promised a benefit. They weren't promised these kinds of benefits, but they were promised access to military medicine. I want them to have it. 
   As bases have closed and as people now do not live near military bases, we have to come up with another program. But I think it ought to be a rational program. I think it ought to be one we look at over time. So I am going to vote to sustain this point of order. 
   I think this bill is simply an outward and visible sign of what is happening in our Congress. I wish America could be awakened to it. We are on a spending binge that has no precedent in my period of service in Congress. You have to go all the way back to Lyndon Johnson to find spending at the level we are now talking about in the Congress. At first it was just discretionary spending. Now we are into entitlements. As we all know, these things start out small. This one didn't start small, but a lot of them do. But they get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. 
   I appreciate my colleagues' listening. I think this is an issue such that you have to explain to people what you are trying to do. I think it is a very easy issue to say, boy, I am trying to deliver on the commitment in that recruiting poster. I believe in the commitment in the recruiting poster, but you don't deliver on it with a huge program that has never been tested, that was put together by people who do not specialize in this area of government, and where there has never been a debate. I think this is a mistake, and I think we are going to end up regretting it. 
   I think we will someday come back and fix it, but we will not fix it, in my opinion, until we have spent a lot of money and until we have produced a system that--unless we are extraordinarily lucky--is not going to provide the kind of efficient care we need. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin by talking about immigration. I  am a strong supporter of immigration. I am proud that my grandfather came to this country right before the turn of the 20th century. I am proud that my wife's grandfather came to America as an indentured laborer to work in the sugar cane fields in Hawaii. In fact, this summer, I had the very happy experience of our family donating to the Institute of Texan Cultures in San Antonio a photograph of my wife's grandmother that was a picture in a picture book that men went through to pick out what was called a ``picture- book bride'' to send for her to come to America. 
   This pioneer came to America to marry a man she had never met in a strange country whose language she did not speak; she came seeking opportunity and freedom, and found both. 
   That is a story of America in action. Her granddaughter, under Presidents Reagan and Bush, became Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where she oversaw the trading of all futures, including futures on the same cane sugar that her 
   grandfather came to America to cut by hand. 
   I am as strongly committed to immigration as you can be committed to immigration. 
   I also remind my colleagues that the bill before the Senate was co-authored by Senator ABRAHAM, by the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, and by myself. 
   This bill seeks to allow highly skilled people--many of them in graduate school in America--to stay in our country, to help us be competitive in the world market, to help us dominate the information age, and to help us create more jobs for our own people. 
   I challenge anyone to point to a more committed position in favor of immigration than I have taken as a Member of the Senate. 
   In fact, our Presiding Officer may remember a speech I gave once about a young man who worked for me on my staff named Rohit Kumar. I was debating, I believe, Senator KENNEDY at the time. I took this young man's family--his father is a research physician; his mother is a doctor; his uncle is an engineer--and I simply went through a list of Kumars in America--his parents had come here as immigrants. And I talked about the contributions they made and the taxes they paid. The conclusion of my speech was this: America needs more Kumars. By the way, lest anyone be confused by what has now become an American name, the Kumars came from India. 
   Why do I say all this? To make it clear that America is not full. I believe there is still room in America for people who come and bring new genius and new energy and new creativity. But I draw a bright line--it is as bright as the morning Sun--and it is on one issue: People should come to America legally. People should come to America to be part of the American dream. In coming to America, people should not violate the laws of our country. 
   Apparently, our Democrat colleagues feel so comfortable that it is a salable political position to take that they want to change the law to say that people who violated the laws of our country are welcome to America. I reject that. I reject it because it is patently unfair. 
   Our Democrat colleagues even have the arrogance to call this the ``Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act,'' as if the label would make it so. I wonder how many people who are waiting in line to come to America--the several million people who have applied to come legally; people whose spouses have applied to come--I wonder how fair they think it is that they are going to bed every night dreaming of coming to America, and we are going to put somebody who violated the laws of the country in front of them. 
   I do not call that fair. Quite frankly, I am happy to label the idea outrageous and condescending, that if someone is a Latino that they must therefore favor changing the laws to allow people who violated the immigration laws to come and to stay and to invite others to do the same. 
   I remind my colleagues that in 1986 we passed a landmark immigration bill. The fundamental tenets of that bill were, one, we were going to enforce employer sanctions--we have not done that, as everybody who lives in America knows--and two, that if you came before 1982 and you were in good standing, you could apply and become a permanent resident alien and eventually you could become a citizen. But if you came afterward, the commitment of that bill was that was the last general amnesty we were ever going to provide. 
   Now our Democrat colleagues obviously think it is good politics that we should go back on the commitments we made in that bill. Hence, we have the bill that is before us. 
   Let me explain the issue of how we came to be here, then the procedure that is being used. Finally, I will talk about this threat by President Clinton that if we don't adopt a bill legalizing illegal acts, he is going to shut down the FBI and the Justice Department by not funding their appropriations. 
   Let me begin by explaining that we have before us a bill called the H-1B program. Most Americans, I am sure, don't know what H-1B is, but basically this is a procedure in immigration law that allows us to employ uniquely skilled, high-income workers, principally, as it has turned out, in this new area of high technology and computer science--many of these people are actually graduate students in our country; half of the students in the high-tech areas at American universities are foreign born, as I am sure many people know. Because we have such critical shortages in this area, this provision allows these people to stay in America and work and help us create jobs for people who are already here. 
   Our Democrat colleagues claim they are for this bill. The problem is, they won't let us vote on it. But when it gets right down to it, they want to be paid tribute. The tribute they are seeking is passage of another bill that would let people who violated the law to stay in our country. 
   Now we have made it very clear that we are not going to pay tribute. Their problem is, they have gone to Silicon Valley, they have gone to Austin, TX, they have gone to the high-tech centers of America, and they have told people in the high-tech industry: We are with you; the Democrat Party is with you; we are for the H-1B program. The problem they have is, their actions do not comport with their words. And that is why we are here simply saying, if you are for the H-1B program, pass it. 
   I have believed for a couple of days that we are coming to the end of this charade. I don't believe our Democrat colleagues can sustain the American public--that is, the relatively small number of people who are interested in this bill--watching Democrats every day delay a bill which they are out trumpeting their support. You can confuse some of the people some of the time, but people cannot be confused under these circumstances. 
   Meanwhile, our Democrat colleagues are on the verge of throwing in the towel on H-1B by saying, well, we want another bill on another issue. To that end, they have adopted a very unusual procedure of trying to change the rules of the Senate in order to accomplish what they want, and we are going to vote on that at 4:30. That is going to be defeated, soundly defeated. 
   Let me turn to President Clinton. I wonder if, in these waning hours of the Clinton administration, our President has not become so deluded by his power and the semblance of power he has exercised in the last 8 years in beating Congress into submission. I wonder if the President has not started to believe he is King, that somehow he can say to us, if you don't pass a law legalizing illegal activities in America, I will shut down the FBI and the Justice Department. 
   That is what the threat is. The threat is, if we don't pass a bill that says people who violated the law in coming to America can stay here, he will veto an appropriations bill that funds the 
   FBI, the DEA, the Justice Department, and the Federal prison system. It seems to me those aren't the words of a President, those are the words of a King. 
   Does he believe we are so weak in our commitment to the constitutional principle? The Congress is given the power under article I of the Constitution to appropriate money, not the President. 
   I will say to the President, if he wants to veto the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill--I know the bill well because I once had the privilege of chairing that subcommittee --if he wants to veto that bill and risk shutting down the FBI and the Justice  Department and the DEA because we are not going to pass a bill that has nothing to do with those appropriations but simply a bill that legalizes illegal activity, then I would have to say to the President he had better get his pen out and he had better be sure it has ink in it. 
   You never know what is going to happen around here, but let me tell you, from one Senator's point of view, a private in the Army, as long as there is any possibility of resisting this I am never, ever going to sit by without using every right I have as a Senator to stop that from happening. 
   What an outrageous, deeply offensive threat. Are none of our Democrat colleagues offended? I will be interested to see how the sage of the Senate, our colleague from West Virginia, ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, former majority leader, former chairman of the Appropriations Committee, how he feels about a President who has become so deluded about his powers that he believes he is King and that he can say to us, you either legalize illegal acts in America or I will shut down the FBI and the DEA and the Justice Department. 
   I understand we are simple people here in the Senate. We have demonstrated over and over that we don't have President Clinton's ability to communicate with the public. We don't have the ability to stand for one thing one day and the next day do a 180-degree reversal and everybody thinks it is great. 
   But if we don't have the ability to stand up to a President in telling us that unless we pass legislation legalizing illegal activity, he is going to shut down the FBI and the DEA and the Justice Department and the prison system by vetoing an appropriations bill forum--if we can't stand up and debate that, we might as well eliminate Congress and just let Bill Clinton rule. 
   I don't intend to see that happen. It may be we will get run over here, but we are not going to get run over without one great fight. I am going to be surprised in the end if there is not at least one Democrat who is going to join us in this fight. 
   Now, let me turn to the heart and soul of this issue, the belief by our Democrat colleagues that it is good politics to make it legal for people to engage in illegal activity in coming to America. Our Democrat colleagues believe they are going to gain votes in this election by saying that if you violated the law in coming to America, if you jumped in line in front of the several million people who have applied to come legally, don't worry because we intend to legalize what you did. And don't worry about the spouses of people who are already here, who are waiting and praying for the day they can come to America legally, just jump ahead of them, violate the law, come to America, because once you get here, we will embrace you and legalize your actions. 
   I know our Democrat colleagues believe this is good politics. I know our Democrat colleagues believe, because of the way they named this bill, that every immigrant and especially Latinos support illegal immigration. What an outrageous, offensive name for this bill, the ``Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.'' What is fair about a bill that sanctions illegal activities? What is fair about saying to several million people--more of them Latinos than any other ethnic extraction or origin--that it is fair for somebody to violate the law and come to America ahead of you, but it is fair to make you wait month after month, year after year, to join the people you love? That is the Democrats idea of fairness? What is fair about that? 
   I think immigrants--and, quite frankly, I still consider myself one--I don't think most people who are immigrants to America believe this is about fairness. They believe this is a raw political act, and they are right. This is putting politics ahead of people. This is about trying to single out a group of people, as if every Hispanic in my State believes that it is OK to let someone violate the law. 
   I reject that. That is not the way Texans feel, no matter what their ethic origin. I think when people really look at this, they are going to see that this for what it is, an outrageous political act. 
   Since I am going to stand for reelection in a State where many Hispanics are going to vote--and I am proud of the fact that when I ran in 1990, I got about half of the Hispanic vote in my State--I, obviously, do not believe that this is the great political ploy that our Democrat colleagues believe it to be.

   Mr. GRAMM. We would jump millions ahead of those who are currently in other countries, some of them spouses of people who live in America who applied to come here legally. Basically, what the Democrats' bill says is, look, the people who violate the law will be rewarded. I don't believe you promote a respect for law by rewarding people who violate the law, and I don't know a single Texan who believes that, either. 
   Let me make this clear. I am not saying that there are not some special cases where people, because of bureaucracies--and we all know bureaucracies and how they work or don't work--I am not saying there are not thousands, maybe tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of people who have a good case against the bureaucracy and they should have an opportunity to make their case. Whatever we can do to speed the bureaucratic process and give people justice, I am for. I am sure our colleagues, at some point in the debate, will hold up some case of a person who has not gotten due process from the Clinton administration's Immigration and Naturalization Service. But the solution to that is not to throw out the law book; the solution is to install new leadership, to fix the INS bureaucracy and to deal with people's problems effectively and on an individual basis. 
   So let me conclude with the following highlights: No. 1, I am for legal immigration because I think it enriches America. As some of my colleagues know, I was once chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. We were having an event and a very sweet little old lady from Florida stood up and said, ``Senator GRAMM, why does everybody at this meeting talk funny?'' Well, we had a lot of people who I guess you would call ``ethnics'' there, and everybody sort of gasped and wondered what I might say and not hurt anybody's feelings, including this lady's feelings. So I said the first thing that occurred to me: ``Ma'am, I guess people talk funny because this is America.'' 
   I want immigrants to come to America. I want them to join in the American dream, as my family and my  wife's family have been blessed to join in. I want them to come legally, and I draw the line on that. I am willing to face every voter in Texas on that. 
   Our Democrat colleagues are really hoping today that the voters are not paying attention. They are hoping some of these radical groups wanting to change America's law to forgive the fact that their members have violated the law are watching this debate on television. But they hope that the working men and women of America are not paying attention to this issue. They want credit for saying they will reward you for violating the law, but I don't think they are going to want the American people to know the political game they are engaged in with putting politics before people. 
   Let me say that I am happy to debate this issue. I don't have any fear about this issue whatsoever--none. Anybody who wants to come to Texas and debate this issue will have a grand opportunity to do that when I am running, and I look forward to them coming. Texans, including Hispanics, do not believe that those who violate the law should be treated better than people who abide by the law. 
   I think our Democrat colleagues have misjudged this issue if they think hard-working Hispanics in this country believe we ought to allow people to break the law and be rewarded for it. I reject that, I will be happy to debate it, and I am going to be eager to vote on it at 4:30. 
   Finally, to repeat, in case anybody missed it, President Clinton threatened to veto the funding measure for the FBI, the DEA, the Justice Department, and the prison system unless we legalize illegal activity--something that is not only bad policy and that the American people are against, but that has nothing to do with funding Commerce-State-Justice. If the President really believes that is going to work, he believes he has become a King. I think the time has come to show him that he can veto a good bill, but he cannot make us pass this bad law that would legalize and reward lawlessness in America. 
   You can put a pretty face on this. You can sugarcoat it all you want. But what we are seeing is a blatant political act that is before the Senate in an effort to appeal to voters who believe that somehow it is good policy in America to legalize illegal actions and to reward people who have violated the law. Maybe I misjudge America. Maybe I don't understand this issue. But I don't think so. 
   I want everybody to know about this issue. I want to be sure everybody hears about this issue. I would be willing to let this election and every election from now until the end of time be determined by the issue of refusing to legalize illegal activity for political gain. 
   Our Democrat colleagues have chosen poorly, in my opinion. We are not going to be stampeded by President Clinton into passing this bill. 
   I can't prevent it from being put into some bill. I can resist and will resist, and maybe I can be run over as part of some backroom deal. But as a freestanding measure, this bill will never pass as a freestanding measure as long as I am in the Senate. 
   I thank the Chair for allowing me to speak this long. This is an important issue and I feel strongly about it. I want people to know about it. 
   If our colleagues are ready to debate this issue, to quote a famous Shakespeare play: 
 Lay on, Macduff, And damn'd be he that first cries, ``Hold, enough!''  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I had the opportunity, earlier today, to talk  about the effort by Senator DASCHLE and the minority to suspend the rules of the Senate and to bring before this body an amnesty provision. In essence, this provision would reward people who violated the laws of this country by coming to the United States illegally when we have millions of people waiting to come the right way, legally. 
   After I left, the minority leader, in response to what I said, asked if I had seen the Statue of Liberty lately. Let me assure him that not only have I seen it, but that when my grandfather, who came to this country by way of Ellis Island, saw the Statue of Liberty he rejoiced in it. I would also like to ask the people who are for this bill, if they have they seen the Supreme Court Building lately? ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' 
   Without law, we can't have liberty. Without law, we can't have an organized society. We corrupt the legal system when we have a set of rules that people are supposed to operate under, and then for political reasons in an election year, say to all of those who have abided by the law in waiting to come to America, that they are going to be treated differently than people who violated the 
   law in coming to this country. 
   I have seen the Statue of Liberty and I rejoice in it. I want people to give us the best they have so we can build a greater country. But I want people to come, as my grandfather came, as my wife's grandparents came--I want them to come legally. 
   Second, the H-1B program is a temporary work program for highly skilled people. It is an entirely different issue than the issue before us, which is an effort to waive the rules of the Senate and bring before us a bill that would grant amnesty to and reward people who have violated the law. I do not believe my colleagues are going to do this. I know our Democrat colleagues believe this is good politics and that this is going to get them more votes, but I don't believe it. As I said before, I would be willing to let this election, and every other election for the remaining history of this country, be determined on this issue and this issue alone. 
   I do not believe it is good politics to basically say that we are going to reward people who violate the law at the expense of those who abide by the law. 
   Also, the idea that somehow immigrants support this bill I think is outrageous. I think those who have abided by the law resent the fact that we routinely reward people who violate the law. 
   Finally, in 1986 we adopted an amnesty provision, and that was supposed to be the final granting of amnesty. Now we are back trying to renegotiate the deal. The point is, every time we grant one of these amnesty provisions, we say to people all over the world: Violate the law, come to America illegally, and you will ultimately be rewarded for it. 
   I say to people all over the world: Come to America legally, and secondly I say, we need to promote free enterprise to individual freedom where we can take America to them. Not everybody who goes to bed at night praying to come to America is going to get to come. We cannot have the whole world in America, but we can take America to them by promoting the policies worldwide that have made us the greatest and richest country in the history of the world. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am tempted to jump into the debate about education. The problem is not people taking courses. It is learning something from the courses you are taking. 
   I remind my colleagues that the SAT test changed several years ago so that the minimum requirements to play football in division 1 went up from 700 to 840. You might think: Rejoice, we have raised academic standards in athletics in college. The truth is, the test was recentered so that everybody's score was raised by 140 points at that level. I do not look at Senator KENNEDY's test scores and rejoice that we now have achieved the level we had in 1961. Can you imagine any other debate in America where people say: We have great success; we have equaled what America did in 1961. 
   I don't call that success. I call that failure. I call that failure because with all the resources we are spending, the fact that we have yet to achieve what we had achieved in 1961 is the greatest indictment of our education bureaucracy and a failed system that believes that Federal control and Federal money is the answer. 
   But I am not going to discuss that right now. I want to remind people of what has happened all day today here in the Senate. Our Democrat colleagues say they are for the H-1B program. They say they want to allow high-tech workers to come into the country to help us continue to dominate the world in high-tech jobs so that  we can continue to have economic growth. They go out to Silicon Valley and say: We are with you. We are for the H-1B program. Yet they have spent all day filibustering it. 
   I don't understand it. You are either for it or you are against it. Now they say: Well, we are for it, but you have to pass a whole bunch of bills doing other things before we are going to let you adopt it. 
   I think it is time for those who need this bill to say to our Democrat colleagues: If you are for the bill, let us vote on it. 
   We have all heard the cliche, ``if you have friends like that, you don't need enemies.'' The point I want to remind people about is that all day long, the Democrats have been filibustering the H-1B program. So if anybody thinks they are for it, the next time they stand up and say they are for the program, I think the obvious thing to ask is, if you are for it, why are you holding it up? 
   We need this bill because we want to keep America growing. I believe our Democrat colleagues are putting politics in front of people. This bill is important to maintain economic growth. It is important to maintain our technical superiority. 
   I want people to know, with all the thousands of issues that have found their way to the floor of the Senate this afternoon, that what this debate is about is that our Democrat colleagues say they are for the H-1B program, but they are preventing us from voting on it. If you are for it, let us vote on it then. If you are for it, end all these extraneous debates. If you want to debate giving amnesty to people who violated America's law, then offer that somewhere else. Propose a bill, but let us vote on the H-1B program. 
   Why do we need it? We need it because we want to maintain the economic expansion that is pulling people out of poverty. We want to maintain our technological edge. But we can't do those things if the Democrats don't let us pass this bill. 
   If you are following this debate, don't be confused. They say they are for H-1B, the passage of this bill, but they are working every day to throw up roadblocks, to stop it, and to demand some payment for letting us pass it. 
   Let me make it clear, no tribute is going to be paid on this bill. There is not going to be a deal where they get paid off to pass this bill. They go to California and to Texas and other places and say: We are for the high-tech industry. We are for the H-1B program. But the cold reality is that on the floor of the Senate today, we did not get to vote on it. We did not get to pass it. We did not make it law. We did not do what we need to do to maintain this economic prosperity and to maintain our edge in the high-tech area because the Democrats are filibustering H-1B. They say they are for it, but when it gets right down to it, actions speak louder than words. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator BIDEN has time reserved to speak. He is not here. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Kansas be recognized for 20 minutes; that if Senator BIDEN is here at that point, he then be recognized; and that I be recognized for 20 minutes when Senator BIDEN has completed his remarks.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the leader for allowing me the opportunity this morning to talk about Medicare and about pharmaceutical benefits. 
   I will talk about these issues, recognizing two things: One, that Medicare is second only to Social Security as the most important government program in operation today; and two, recognizing that in 1965, when Medicare came into existence and it was focused primarily on hospital care, physician care, and surgery, that reflected the practice of modern medicine in 1965. Today, Medicare is still focused on 1965 medicine. However, pharmaceuticals have taken the place, in many cases, of hospital stays and surgery, and yet Medicare does not pay for pharmaceuticals. 
   What I will address is the cold reality of where we are, what we want to do, but the dangers we face if we do it wrong. I view this as a statement on the problems we face in trying to provide pharmaceuticals in Medicare. 
   I hope to do this with a series of charts. I begin with the good news. The good news--the glorious news--is that 68.8 percent of all Medicare recipients already have some form of prescription drug coverage--68.8 percent. That level of coverage is a level of coverage virtually unmatched in terms of the structure of private health insurance. What it means is that almost 69 percent of people in America already have some form of pharmaceutical coverage when they are under Medicare. 
   Obviously, what this says is, whatever we do, we don't want to do anything that imperils the 69 percent of people who already have pharmaceutical coverage in our effort to try to provide it to the 31 percent of people who don't. 
   Where does this coverage come from? If we look at this chart, we can see that 44.6 percent of the people who have pharmaceutical coverage in Medicare are getting it through their employer. This is part of the benefit for which they worked a lifetime. They are getting it through an employer-sponsored program. Obviously, we don't want to do anything to induce employers to drop that coverage, nor do we want to do anything to substitute taxpayer money for the private money that is currently going into private health insurance to cover our seniors for pharmaceutical coverage. 
   There are 15.2 percent of those who have pharmaceutical coverage who get it from Medicaid; 11.9 percent get it from HMOs as part of Medicare; 10.6  percent who switched coverage during the last year and went from one form of coverage to another, so they are not counted as being in one category for the year that they had it. Then finally, 15.2 percent get pharmaceutical coverage through Medigap policies. That is the way my momma, for example, gets her pharmaceutical coverage--through a Medigap policy. 
   What is the point of all this? What does this mean? Why should anybody care about this? 
   The point is, 69 percent of Americans already have something we want to provide to 31 percent of Americans. We want to be very sure--we might even have a bipartisan agreement on this at some point--we want to be very sure we don't do anything, in trying to help the 31 percent, that could endanger, destroy, eliminate, or replace the coverage that 69 percent of those on Medicare already have. 
   What is it going to cost for the various plans that have been proposed? My colleagues will remember--I am sure the Presiding Officer remembers--that when Lyndon Johnson sold the Senate on passing Medicare, it was going to cost less than $1 billion a year. Medicare has now become the second largest program in America. It is on its way to becoming the most expensive program in the history of America or the history of the world. The point being, we don't always have the ability to predict what costs are going to be. 
   Nothing shows this more clearly than the official estimates that have been made of the Clinton-Gore drug plan. When they first introduced their plan, the Office of Management and Budget estimated that the plan would cost $118.8 billion over the first 10 years. 
   By April of that year, the official estimate from CBO was $149.3 billion. By May, the estimate by the Congressional Budget Office had risen to $160 billion. By July, the estimate from CBO had risen to $337.7 billion. 
   The point is, what happened to the program between the first estimate made when it was proposed and July? Well, the program was never implemented. What happened is--the President made some changes in it, but what really happened is people started looking deeper and deeper into the program. 
   The plain truth is, we don't know what the actual cost is going to be. But we know if you are going to have the federal government take over and basically federalize pharmaceuticals so that you are going to have the taxpayer paying for benefits, when currently 44.6 percent of the people who have pharmaceutical coverage are getting it from their former employer--when you have the government take it over and pay for not just the 31 percent who don't have it but for the 69 percent who do, obviously it is going to cost a lot of money. 
   Secondly, remember that the level of usage clearly is affected by who pays. There are many different figures you can use, but let me just use one figure. For those on Medicare who do not have third party coverage for pharmaceuticals--that is, they don't have somebody else paying their pharmaceutical bills in total or in part--they are spending, on average, less than $400 a year. But for Medicaid beneficiaries where the federal government is paying for all of their pharmaceutical bills, they are spending over $700 a year. 
   Now some people would say, you either need pharmaceuticals or you don't. The point is, as is true in anything, it makes a difference whether there are copayments, whether there are deductibles, and who is paying. The point this chart makes very clearly is that we have already seen, in one year, the estimated cost of the Clinton-Gore drug plan rise from $118.8 billion to $337.7 billion, and it is not implemented. The point is, we really don't have any idea about how much it is going to cost. As costs go up, what happens? As costs go up, first premiums go up, and then there is political resistance to premiums. 
   What happened in England with a program similar to the Clinton-Gore plan? What happened in Canada? What happened in Germany? As costs rise, with political pressure to keep premiums down, what happens? In every country in the world that has adopted a one-size-fits-all government program, one thing has happened--and it is not as if it were different in Germany from in Britain, or different in Britain from in Canada. One thing has always happened: When you have a one-size-fits-all government program and costs explode, they ration health care. 
   Great Britain is a good example. They delay the implementation of new drugs until the cost of those drugs comes down. That may make sense in controlling government costs, but if your mama is sick or your baby is dying, that is rationing health care. And every country in the world, to try to deal with this exact problem of exploding costs, when they have the government take over with a one-size-fits-all program, they end up rationing pharmaceuticals. 
   So we have people in the Senate who stand up and say that in Great Britain you can get X drug cheaper. What they don't explain is that it wasn't introduced for 2 years because of the cost, because it was rationed by the government. That is something we have to be concerned about because nobody in America wants to be in a situation where, when their mama is sick, they end up talking to some bureaucrat about cost instead of to a doctor about health care. 
   This is the greatest dilemma we face in doing something about pharmaceuticals. This is not a problem of anything other than arithmetic. Today, half of the people who receive Medicare spend 
   less than $500 annually on prescription drugs. That is a fact. When people hear on television that we are debating having the government set up a program to pay for their pharmaceuticals, they think we are talking about the government paying for their pharmaceuticals. But the plain truth is--as anybody who has actually looked at the plan that has been proposed by Clinton and Gore knows--the first thing they discover is that when it is fully implemented, you are going to have to pay $662.40 in annual premiums for a plan that pays for half of your pharmaceuticals up to, ultimately, $5,000. 
   Here is the point. Half of all of the seniors are in the position today where their pharmaceutical bills are $500 or less. If we implement a program that has the government take over prescription drugs so that we don't have 68.8 percent of people covered by other health insurance, as we have today, but we have everybody in a government-run program, the premium cost of this is very high. And remember, this is based on a cost estimate which, if we know anything about these programs, is a gross underestimation. The annual premium cost is $662.40, and for that the government pays half of your pharmaceutical costs. 
   So here is the point. If the government is paying half of a Medicare beneficiaries prescription drug costs, most Medicare beneficiaries are going to get out of this program less than $250 of benefits, but they are going to pay $662.40 in premiums just to be in the program. 
   Now how many seniors understand that half of them are going to get $250 or less worth of benefits, but are going to end up paying $662.40 a year in premiums? What kind of bargain is it to pay $662.40 to get a benefit worth $250 or less? It is a very bad bargain, which explains why it is mandatory--why either you have to take it the first day you are eligible or you can never get into the program. They have to find ways of forcing people into this bad deal because they are not content to try to help the 31 percent of the people who don't have the insurance. They are trying to force everybody into one program run by the government, of course; and in doing so, for every one person to whom you provide new coverage, you in essence take away coverage that two people already have, which is not funded by the government. 
   That is why these cost estimates on a one-size-fits-all government-run program are so cataclysmic and why, if you ask people, Do you want government to provide pharmaceutical coverage in Medicare? the vast majority of people say yes. But when you explain to them that half of the people on Medicare today spend less than $500 on prescription drugs and, when the program is fully implemented, the annual premium is going to be $662.40 that will pay for only half of your pharmaceuticals up to the point you spend $5,000, people will look and see that half the people are getting $250 in benefits, and they are spending $662.40 initially when the program is fully implemented and see it isn't a good deal. 
   But  does anybody doubt the program will be at least twice that when it is ultimately in place? I don't think so. 
   In this political environment we are in, people are always talking about risky schemes. We have all heard it. It is amazing to me that people will talk about spending trillions of dollars, but if you want to give half that amount in tax cuts, it is a risky scheme--spending it is not risky, but giving it back to working families is risky. 
   Let me talk about how risky this government takeover of the pharmaceutical benefits in America for seniors is. The Clinton-Gore plan is back-end loaded. What do I mean by that? I mean that the first year it is very cheap because it doesn't even go into effect for 2 years from now. Then it becomes very expensive. The first year of the program advertises that it will cost only $13.5 billion. When the program is fully implemented, it costs $59.7 billion, or almost $60 billion a year. When we run this out over a 10-year period and we look at the estimates that are being made when fully implemented, whereas the initial estimate by the Office of Management and Budget was the program would cost $118.8 billion, when we take its cost at full implementation and what we already know, its actual cost is $597 billion over 10 years. 
   How are we going to make up this difference? Britain has a government-run benefit on pharmaceuticals. Germany has one. Canada has one. How did they make it up? They made it up by raising the premiums initially, and when political resistance occurred, they start rationing health care. That is what we would be buying into here. 
   There is one other difference, and this is from the Congressional Budget Office ``Analysis of the Health Insurance Initiatives in the Mid-Session Review'' that they published on July 18. I urge my colleagues to look at it. They analyzed the Clinton-Gore drug plan. Most people are obviously focused on, what is it going to cost? The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan budgeting arm of Congress, finds that not only is it going to cost a tremendous amount more than what is being claimed, but equally disturbing to me is this quote:  
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that after 10 years, the average price of drugs consumed by the Medicare beneficiaries would be 8 percent higher if the President's proposal was enacted.  
   In other words, not only will taking over pharmaceutical coverage for all Medicare beneficiaries, when only 31 percent don't have it, cost a tremendous amount of money, but it will drive up the cost of pharmaceuticals to everyone. This is not just to seniors, this is to everyone. 
   What is the alternative? Interestingly enough, the best alternative is a bipartisan proposal from a bipartisan commission that was led by Senator BREAUX, a Democrat, from Louisiana. 
   I have a very revealing chart. I will give Michael Solon on my staff credit for this. I think this is one chart that tells a very important story. Here is what it is based on. The question it asks is the following: If you left everything exactly as it is, and you held the growth of government discretionary programs to the budget, how long could the government pay Medicare and Social Security benefits as they are currently promised? In other words, when would the government run out of money to pay for Medicare and Social Security benefits under the best of circumstances? 
   He finds, under the current system, the federal government would run out of money in the year 2027. If we don't spend the money or use it for anything else, we keep spending in real terms where it is, and we use all the money in the budget to fund just Social Security and Medicare, the federal governments runs out of money in 2027. That means everybody 40 and over would, for all practical purposes, be covered, but everybody under 40 would be 
   vulnerable to the federal government's inability to pay Medicare and Social Security benefits. 
   If you adopted the Clinton-Gore plan, what you would do is, by driving up costs, move this doomsday or day of reckoning--whatever you want to call it--from 2027 to 2022, which means that only people 44 and above would have their Medicare and Social Security benefits secured. Stated another way, 17 million people who are between 40 and 44--those 17 million middle-aged people in that 4-year bracket--would have their Medicare benefit and their Social Security benefit imperiled by the adoption of the Clinton-Gore plan. 
   What is the alternative? The alternative is a bipartisan proposal. The estimates that were done of the bipartisan commission--and I remind my colleagues, people were appointed by the Speaker and the minority leader, by the majority leader and by the minority leader, and by the President--they put together a proposal that a majority supported. But because all of President Clinton's appointees voted against the final package, it did not get the supermajority needed to make a formal recommendation. 
   However, the majority supported the Breaux proposal. The Breaux proposal basically reformed Medicare and provided pharmaceutical benefits to the 31 percent of the people, or most of them, who don't have Medicare, don't have coverage for pharmaceutical benefits. The important thing was that the reform of Medicare contained in the Breaux commission report--by reforming Medicare, extended its lifetime from 2027 to 2059, which would mean anybody over 8 years old would have their benefits guaranteed if we adopted the bipartisan Breaux commission report. 
   What is the point of this speech? The whole point of this is the following, and I think these points were very important and I want to just run through them real quickly. Point one, you have 69 percent of all seniors who have some pharmaceutical coverage already. Why would you want to have the government come in and pay for that, especially when 44 percent of them are having it paid for by their former employers? That doesn't make any sense. 
   The only case in which you would want to do that is if you had some political agenda that said we ought to have a government-run health care system. I submit, based on the record of this administration, when they tried in 1993 and 1994 to have the government take over and run the health care system, that is exactly what their agenda is. But, notice--and this is easy to explain--if you have a problem with 31 percent of the people but you have 69 percent who already have a benefit, don't tear up what they have trying to help the people who need it. That is the first point. 
   The second point is that when you try to have a program that covers everybody, and you start substituting government dollars, tax dollars for other health insurance that 69 percent of the people already have, you are forced into a system where most seniors will not benefit. 
   As I explained earlier, today over half of all Medicare beneficiaries spend less than $500 a year on prescription drugs. Yet under this one-size-fits-all, government-runs-it, government-controls-it plan that has been proposed by the President and endorsed by the Vice President, when that plan is phased in, in order to get coverage where the government will pay half of your prescription costs up to you spending $5,000, it costs you $662.40 a year in premiums. But half of all Medicare beneficiaries would only get benefits of $250 or less. Needless to say, when you say to seniors, ``We have a great deal for you, we are going to give you a benefit for $662 a year that half of you will find to be worth less than $250 in any given year,'' they are not excited about it. So how do you deal with that? 
   You deal with that by trying to mislead people about what it is going to cost. You don't phase in the whole program. You don't even start the program for 2 years, so, boy, it is cheap for the first 2 years because you don't have a program. Then you phase it in. 
   The point is, when you do that, you start out cheap--$13.5 billion. But when you get it fully phased in, even based on the estimates of the Congressional Budget Office--and we know the real costs will be higher--you are already up to about $60 billion a year when you get it fully implemented. 
   Obviously, anybody who is trying to be critical of what is being proposed has the obligation to propose an alternative. Fortunately, as a member of the Medicare Commission with Senator BREAUX and Senator KERREY--the two Democrat members who worked on the majority position--there was a proposal made. That proposal was a comprehensive reform of the system.  
   That comprehensive reform, which provided pharmaceuticals for moderate-income people but let the 69 percent of the people who already had pharmaceutical coverage keep it, didn't substitute tax dollars for General Motors' money on retirement health care. What happened was, whereas the Clinton-Gore plan would actually endanger the Medicare and Social Security benefits of people between the ages of 40 and 44 by driving up costs and by forcing those systems into insolvency or into fee increases or into tax increases sooner, the bipartisan proposal of the Breaux commission would have actually expanded the life of Medicare to 2059. That would mean everybody 8 years old and older would be protected. It would give us an opportunity to further refine the system. 
   I thank my colleagues for giving me this opportunity. These are important issues. They deserve prayerful consideration. I urge my colleagues to look at them before we change Medicare. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, like most people this morning, I read the headline ``Physicist Lee Freed With Apology.'' I want to comment on this.  I want to be careful about what I say because I am angered and embarrassed about what has happened to one of our fellow Americans. 
   For the last few months I have been troubled by the case of Wen Ho Lee. I have been troubled because I have had the deep suspicion that Dr. Lee was a victim of scapegoatism by the Justice Department and by the Energy Department. But I tried to follow the old adage we all learn from our mamas--that when you do not have the facts, wait until you get the facts before you have something to say. Today we have the facts. The facts are that the Federal judge in this case said--talking about Janet Reno, the Attorney General of the United States of America, and Bill Richardson, the Secretary of Energy--and I quote the Federal judge:  
   They did not embarrass me alone. They have embarrassed our entire nation and each of us who is a citizen of it.  
   Let me say they certainly embarrassed me. It seems to me that what happened was we had a terrible breach of security. Our Energy Department was asleep at the switch when the nuclear secrets of this country were stolen. That was raised to a level of public awareness. Rather than going out and finding the person who was guilty of stealing these secrets, it now appears that what the Justice Department did, to its great shame and our embarrassment, is engage in racial profiling to identify an Asian American of Chinese ancestry, Dr. Lee, and to use him as a scapegoat for the failure of this administration to protect American national security. 
   This individual citizen ended up month after month in solitary confinement, having been charged in a 59 count indictment, and then when it was clear that there was no case, they plea bargained to release him on a minor offense. I say ``minor'' only as compared to the selling of nuclear secrets of the United States to the Chinese, or giving such information to them. Dr. Lee transferred secure data to a nonsecure source, a charge for which John Deutch, in a much higher position of government in this administration, was never prosecuted. 
   In return for admitting guilt to this charge, this man, who was denied his freedom and who was on the verge of having his life ruined, is now exonerated by a Federal judge. I would like to say this: 
   First of all, I don't understand an administration that stands up and damns racial profiling and yet engages in it when it suits their political agenda. 
   I don't understand scapegoating when you are talking about a man's freedom and when you are talking about a man's life. 
   I think if our Attorney General, Janet Reno, had any honor and any shame, and I think if Bill Richardson had any honor and any shame, they would resign as a result of this outrage to the American people. 
   The idea that this man was in solitary confinement month after month, deemed a public enemy, and vilified, it seems to me, at least, based on everything we know--and it seems if the Justice Department had any facts, they would have presented them to this court and to this judge--because of his race. I think it is an outrage. And I think an apology is due from the President of the United States. 
   I think this is a terrible wrong and an outrage. I have for months been suspicious that this was happening, but I didn't want to say anything until we had the facts. 
   I hope my language hasn't offended anybody. But I just do not understand people who, to get political cover for their own failings, don't seem to care that we are talking about the life of a real person. Our system is not based on my rights, or Bill Clinton's rights, it is based on the rights of each individual citizen. 
   The idea that this man has had his good name and his family so attacked and has been in solitary confinement when the only thing the Justice Department ended up getting him to plea bargain on was that he took material out of a secure setting to a nonsecure setting when another official of this Government, by his own admission, did exactly the same thing and was never prosecuted--this is a terrible outrage. 
   I just didn't feel comfortable not saying something about it. I just wanted to go on RECORD as saying that there is something very wrong in America. This is not the America I grew up in when this kind of thing happens. Somebody in the Senate needed to say something about it. I decided that was me. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Thompson amendment. I oppose it because it is a bad amendment. Its logic is flawed. It would hurt America more than it would punish China. Let me try to explain why. 
   First of all, the Thompson amendment goes far beyond denying China access to American dual-use technology that could have defense applications. The Thompson amendment would take American capital markets and inject politics into them by denying access, for the first time, to a nation that is not engaged in a direct conflict with the United States of America, under our traditional definition of conflict. 
   Some people seem to have the idea that by adopting PNTR we will be having a marriage with China--that somehow, because we are endorsing normal trade relations with China, we would in effect be endorsing Chinese policies on how they treat their workers, how they protect religious freedom, how they protect the environment, and how they conduct their foreign policy. 
   We are not doing any of those things. 
   Every criticism of China that has been made is valid. Senator THOMPSON talked earlier about not wanting to irritate the Chinese. I am perfectly willing to irritate the Chinese. But this legislation is about establishing normal trade relations--the same relations we have with virtually every country in the world except countries directly involved in terrorism--with China. We are not talking about a military alliance or a political marriage. We are talking only about normal trade relations. 
   The Thompson amendment to the PNTR bill would impose political controls on the American capital market with regard to China. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan says that the Thompson amendment's financial sanctions ``would undercut the viability of our own system and would harm us more than it would harm others.'' The Securities and Exchange Commission says the Thompson amendment is ``antithetical to the United States approach to capital market access and free movement of capital.'' The Securities Industry Association, which represents securities markets nationwide, says the Thompson amendment ``could seriously disrupt investor confidence in United States markets and jeopardize their continued vitality, debt and liquidity.'' 
   Senator THOMPSON says he wants a vote on his amendment. I have no objection to Senator THOMPSON having a vote. But he doesn't want anybody else to have a vote on it. If we are going to consider major legislation like the Thompson amendment, as chairman of one of the committees with jurisdiction over major elements of that amendment I would like to have an opportunity to offer my own amendments to it. I know we can get carried away with amendments. And Senator THOMPSON makes a good point. Committees of jurisdiction aren't everything. But I think it is important that we get Alan Greenspan and other people who understand our financial markets to give us input before we take a major step like instituting controls on America's capital markets. 
   The capital markets and financial institutions controls in the Thompson legislation go against what we have been trying to achieve with the Chinese for many years. For years we negotiated with the Chinese to get them  to open their markets to American financial services companies. We want citizens in China to be able to own a piece of the rock and to invest in retirement accounts in America. Senator THOMPSON's amendment would set up a mechanism to deny them the very rights for which we negotiated so long and hard. 
   I am not here to endorse China's practices--far from it. I condemn their policies with regard to the environment, with regard to their workers, with regard to religious freedom, and with regard to proliferation. But that is not what we are talking about here. We are talking about establishing normal trade relations. And the key point is: Does anybody believe any one of these areas of concern will be better if we reject PNTR? 
   I remind my colleagues that in 1948 there were 23 countries that signed the agreement that founded the GATT, now called the WTO. Their common goal was to expand economic trade. One of those 23 countries was China. But one year later, China turned to the dark side. They wanted to remake their society. They wanted to build a ``ladder to heaven.'' They wanted to create equality, except for their political leaders. And they did it--they made everybody poor. Chinese per capita income nosedived. By 1978, Taiwan, which started with fewer economic resources, had a per capita income of $1,560 a year. China's was $188. Today, Taiwan has a $13,000 per capita income, while China's is just $790. 
   But the good news is that fifty-two years later, China wants to reverse the terrible decision she made back then, and re-enter the world of trade. China is turning away from the dark side. She is back knocking on the door. Now the question is, Are we going to slam the door in their face? 
   I say no. Trade promotes freedom. If you are concerned about 
   workers rights in China, do you believe that workers will have more rights in a growing private sector, where they can work for somebody other than the Government? I don't see how you can help but believe that. And if you believe it, then you are going to be for normal trade relations with China. If you want political and religious freedom in China, then give people economic freedom, which ultimately promotes political freedom, as we have seen in Korea and in Taiwan. Developing economic growth in China, so that people have a stake in economic freedom, will ultimately produce a demand on their part for political freedom. And in the process they will begin to change China. 
   The Thompson amendment is legislation that needs dramatic changes. If we don't table this amendment, it is not going to be adopted. We are going to offer amendments to it. I would be perfectly happy to see this amendment brought up as a freestanding bill, but I want the opportunity to debate it and to amend it. Senator THOMPSON wants to have a vote on his legislation, but he doesn't want anybody else to have a vote on their amendments to his legislation. I think that is what ultimately brought us to where we are now. 
   There are security concerns with China. They need to be dealt with. But they cannot be dealt with within the context of PNTR, with a bill that has never been through a committee, that has never had a hearing on its impact, that has not been looked at it to see whether it makes sense. Will it do what we want it to do? Will it hurt us more than it hurts other people? 
   So I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and to adopt normal trade relations with China. We are not endorsing China. We are trying to trade with them. We are trying to promote economic freedom because we know economic freedom not only enriches us and them, but ultimately produces an irresistible demand by people to have political freedom. When they have economic freedom, China will change. 
   This is a bad amendment. It is not ready to be adopted. I hope we table it. As I said, if we don't table it, we are going to amend it; and then we are going to be in a long debate about a subject that is relevant and important. But it is a subject that does not have to do with establishing normal trade relations with China, which is the point of the underlying legislation and which I support. 
   I will, therefore, vote to table this amendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have a great deal of respect for Senator THOMPSON and the issues he has raised. The problem is these issues fit more closely on the Export Administration Act. They have not been considered in committee. I think they represent a very real problem in this bill. I think it is important that if we are going to debate issues such as this, they be not just fully debated but they be subject to amendment. 
   On that basis, let me yield. Senator ENZI wants to be recognized.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our dear colleague from Iowa for yielding. While my time will be charged against the majority time on the Byrd amendment, I want to talk about the bill itself. 
   Mr. President, you run for a high office such as the Senate because you want to have an opportunity to have an effect on people's lives. You hope that effect you have is going to be a positive one. What we have political parties and debate for is to determine which policies are positive and which are negative in terms of their impact on people. I would have to say I have seldom had an opportunity to speak on an issue or to vote on legislation that I think is more important for the future of every American and more important for all the people who live on this planet than the issue of establishing normal trade relations with China. 
   I would like to try to look at this in more of a historic context, to try to define why I think this is such a big deal and why this is so important to every person living on the planet. In 1948, from the rubble of World War II, a group of 23 nations got together to form an organization that became known as the GATT. What that organization was trying to do was to learn from the experiences of the 20th century, to learn from the experiences of the Great Depression where we turned a recession into a depression with protectionism and protective tariffs, to learn from the terrible experiences of a world war. 
   Those nations had a vision, in 1948, to set up a world trading system so that people could produce goods and services and sell them all over the world so that countries would not end up getting into wars over resources, because resources would be freely traded. And since people living anywhere could specialize doing the things they did best, those nations believed the welfare of each individual citizen and all citizens combined would be enhanced. 
   Remarkably, those 23 nations that set up what we know today as the world's trading system included China. In 1948, 52 years ago, China joined the United States, Great Britain, and other countries with a dream of promoting world trade. But then, in 1949, just 1 year later, something happened. What happened was China took the wrong turn. China turned to the dark side. China listened to politicians who said they were for the people and not for the privileged. China thought they could create wealth by tearing down wealth. China thought you could build up somebody by tearing down somebody else. So they set about creating what Chairman Mao called a ``ladder to paradise.'' The net result was the destruction of capital, the destruction of private property, the destruction of any kind of modern system for economic development--and untold suffering and poverty for the Chinese people. Remarkably, a country with among the most able people in the world found itself among the poorest countries on the planet. China had achieved the Marxist dream of making people equal--but it was an equality in poverty and hopelessness. I should say that it was equality for everybody except a small number of political leaders; they seem to never be equal. 
   If anybody needs any numerical examples of what a difference economic freedom makes, listen to these numbers. In 1949, mainland China and Taiwan had roughly equal per capita incomes. The mainland had all the natural resources, and obviously they had the same kind of people. By 1978, by promoting world trade, protecting private property, and increasingly allowing people to make economic choices for themselves, the per capita income of Taiwan had risen to $1,560 a year. In contrast, per capita income on the mainland was a wretched $188 a year. Today, the per capita income of Taiwan is over $13,000 a year. And while China has started to turn from the dark side, while dramatic changes are underway in China, per capita income there is currently only $790 a year. 
   Why is this vote so important? The vote is so important because in 1948 China was one of 23 nations that shared our dream of an open world with relatively free trade. Then in 1949 they turned to the dark side, and the Chinese people paid a terrible price for that decision. Today, 52 years after helping to found what now is the World Trade Organization, China is back knocking on the door, in essence saying we did the wrong thing by turning to the dark side 51 years ago, and now we want to come back and join the rest of the world in the free exchange of goods and services. 
   This is an important occasion, it seems to me, because we have to answer the question: Are we going to open the door or are we going to slam the door in their face? 
   We often get carried away around here in thinking that if people are not perfect, they are not good enough. We have heard a lot of criticisms about China on the floor of the Senate, and they are the same criticisms heard around the country. Based on the facts I would say the criticisms are absolutely correct. 
   The two arguments we have heard more than any other argument in this debate are, No. 1, there is relatively little religious freedom in modern China. Obviously, that is true. I remember when Senator MCCAIN and I were in Beijing and we were visiting with the President of China. We had raised the question about Tibet and about religious freedom. He said: We do not object to people practicing religion. It is proselytizing we object to. 
   I said: Mr. President, you don't know proselytizing. Wait until the Baptists and the Mormons get over here. You haven't seen proselytizing. 
   When people think they have found something in religion, they want to share it. But in China they do not have a conception of what religious freedom is. If we are going to trade only with countries that have granted its people the full range of religious freedom, China today fails on that account. But that is not the right question. The right question is, Will there be more religious freedom in China tomorrow than today if we reject this agreement, or will there be more religious freedom if we accept it? 
   I tried during that meeting, and have on several subsequent occasions in meeting with Chinese leaders, to explain that freedom is like pregnancy. You cannot have just a little of it. It takes on its own life. When people have economic freedom, they want political freedom. When people have a right to own property and make decisions about their own future, they want the ability to make decisions about their own leaders. We have seen it in Taiwan. We have seen it in Korea. It is changing the world, and it will change China. 
   For our colleagues who say they object to religious suppression in China, so do I. I object to it, and that is one of the reasons I am for normal trade relations with China. I believe that based on all of our historic experience, trade will change China. The ability of people to trade and, in the process, to experience prosperity and have the economic freedom that comes from the ability to buy American products, to know the joy of wearing cotton underwear made out of Texas and American cotton, to get the ability to own stock in America, to get the ability to own bank accounts denominated in U.S. dollars--all of that is provided in this agreement. 
   Once you have a bank account with U.S. dollars in it, you are fundamentally changed forever. You want your right to have your say, and you want the right not only to make decisions in your family, but you want the right to ultimately affect decisions of your country, and you want the right to worship God as you choose. When you have economic freedom and the prosperity it brings, you ultimately have the power to get religious freedom. 
   Many of our colleagues say that the Chinese do not respect workers' rights, and they do not. If one was going to judge this agreement based on how workers are treated, how do you expect a country to treat workers when most people work for the government? How do you think this country would treat workers if we all worked for the government? Workers end up being treated well because they have opportunities, because if they do not like how they are being treated on this job, they can quit and go to work somewhere else. 
   We hear the AFL-CIO talk about workers' rights in China. If they really  cared about workers' rights in China, they would be for this agreement because what this agreement is going to mean is more trade, more capital, more competition, more freedom, a larger number of employers in China and, therefore, the freedom that people will have to quit working for the government and government-sponsored enterprises and work in the private sector. 
   I am not here to argue today that we ought to agree to normal trade relations with China because China treats its workers well. I am here to argue for normal trade relations with China because if we have normal trade relations with China, workers will be treated better because they will have more opportunities, they will have more freedom. 
   There are some people who make the most fraudulent argument of all, and that is the argument that they oppose normal trade relations with China because China does not protect its environment, or because China makes decisions about its environment to which we object. If you really care about the environment in China--and they are part of the environment of the planet on which we live--you should be for this agreement because what poor country protects its environment? What country with a per capita income of $790 a year has the luxury of being concerned about its environment? I can answer that. None. 
   If you want the environment to be better protected in China, you want more economic growth, more economic freedom, more prosperity so that people have the luxury of being concerned about the environment. 
   I am not here today to say people who say there is no religious freedom in China are wrong. I am not here today to say that the people who say workers' rights are not respected in China are wrong. I am not here to say people are wrong when they say that China does not protect their environment. They are right. 
   The question is not what is China like today; the question is what will China be like tomorrow. The answer will be based on what we do in terms of either opening this door to let them into the world of trade, or slamming the door in their face. 
   There are other people who say if we let China in, ultimately that is going to mean that when we go to Wal-Mart, that shirts are going to be cheaper, that sweaters are going to be cheaper, that clothing is going to be cheaper, that implements are going to be cheaper, and that that is a bad thing because they could be made in America. I reject that. I think it is a plus. I thank God every day that people can go to Wal-Mart and buy clothing that is inexpensive. Few benefactors in the history of America or the world have done more than Wal-Mart to benefit ordinary people. The Chinese can produce quality goods that the people of Texas want to buy. I believe in freedom, and part of freedom is the right to buy something if it is legally traded and if it benefits your family. 
   What do we get from these agreements? We have heard a lot of talk about the fact that we get a 17-percent reduction in average tariffs on agriculture. I can assure you that is going to be good news for our corn producers in Texas. It is going to be good news for our cotton producers. We believe that as the Chinese get an opportunity to eat Texas beef, they are going to like it, and as their income grows, they are going to want a lot more of it. 
   We also believe that lowering industrial tariffs in China from an average of 25 percent to an average of 9 percent is going to be a dramatic boom to U.S. manufacturing, especially the manufacturing of high-quality items in high-wage industries, such as our high-tech industries. We believe we will benefit. 
   As chairman of the Banking Committee, I wish to touch on three other industries that are also going to benefit. My colleagues know that we in America produce financial services better and more efficiently and more abundantly than any other country in the world. Needless to say, this is a high-wage industry. It is one in which we dominate the world, and we want to continue it. I will touch briefly on a couple of these industries. 
   In the insurance market in China today, there is an ad hoc system where U.S. and foreign insurers get a license to operate based on political favor, on good fortune, or having been there first. 
   And as an insurer, you have very real limits on where you can sell your products. 
   Under the November 15 agreement, China will grant licenses without quantitative limits or needs testing to qualified foreign insurers. American insurance companies will be able to sell in China. And China's geographic limits on where foreign insurers can sell insurance products will be phased out over a 3-year period. 
   Don't you think it will be good for people in China to get an opportunity to own a piece of the ``rock''? It seems to me that if anything ties us together and promotes peace and trade, it is having people in China be able to invest in American insurance companies, or buy IRAs, or enter into 401(k) retirement programs where the money is invested in the United States of America and around the world. Clearly we all benefit from that. 
   Today, foreign banks in China can engage only in commercial banking if they are located in 20 specific cities. Foreign banks can only offer banking products in foreign currency. That means that for most people in China, they do not have access to American banks. It's an extremely limited ability to operate. Basically, what foreign banks have to do is to get Chinese partners, which means they basically must give part of their business away for the right to operate in China. 
   But under the November 15 agreement, all geographic restrictions on foreign banking in China will be lifted within 5 years. American banks will be able to own 100 percent of their banking operations in China. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.

   Mr. GRAMM. And within 5 years, American banks will be able to do banking business in Chinese currency. 
   I cannot imagine how the world won't be better off when people working in China can bank in American banks, and use American banking products. If that is not the essence of freedom, I don't know what is. 
   It's a similar story for our securities industry. Today, there are very real limits on American securities firms' activities in China, and on the ability of U.S. companies to invest and to have clear operating ownership. Those restrictions will be significantly modified for the benefit of our industry as well as the Chinese. 
   To sum up, with the implementation of the November 15 agreement and the adoption of this PNTR legislation, the American financial sector as well as our industry and agricultural sectors will have an extraordinary opportunity to compete in a growing market of 1.2 billion consumers. 
   It is seldom in the Senate that you vote on something that represents history in the making. A lot of what we do here--and a lot of what everybody does in every job in the world--is a bunch of little things about which they don't necessarily get excited. Today, we have an opportunity to work on something that is critically important, something that truly will dramatically improve the world in which we live. 
   I am very strongly in favor of the pending PNTR legislation. I am opposed to amending this legislation. There are many good ideas for amendments, but the bottom line is this is something that is important. This is something that is historic. We need to get on with it, without tacking on amendments. 
   I thank our colleague very much for yielding me the time. 
   Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, my dad was a sergeant in the Army. I have always believed in a strong defense, and I have always prided myself on the fact that at least, in my opinion, no one in the Senate was a stronger supporter of national defense and a stronger supporter of the men and women who wear the uniform of this country and who keep us free. 
   I, therefore, thought it was incumbent on me to explain why I am going to vote against this Defense appropriations bill. 
   Let me start by giving you a little history because I think it explains why we are at this extraordinary point with a bill that seems so very hard to explain. It started with President Clinton. It is, unfortunately, a standard pattern that, from time to time, we have Presidents who come into office and cut defense, and then as they are on the verge of waving goodbye, they propose massive increases in defense spending. 
   My dear colleague from Arizona will remember that the largest period of increases in defense spending in the peacetime history of the country did not start while Ronald Reagan was President. It, in fact, started the last year Jimmy Carter was President, even though Jimmy Carter cut national defense expenditures consistently during his Presidency. 
   President Clinton, in the first 5 years he was President, cut defense spending every single day. In the first year of his Presidency, real defense spending fell by 5.8 percent. In 1994, real defense spending again fell by 5.8 percent. In 1995, it fell by 4.7 percent; in 1996, 4.9 percent; in 1997, 0.5 percent; in 1998, 2.8 percent. In every one of those years, real resources that we committed to national security and to the well-being of the men and women who defend America declined. 
   Then, in 1999, finally, as we were looking at the 1999 budget, the Joint Chiefs of Staff finally stopped toeing the line for President Clinton, stopped apologizing for the decimation of the military, and pointed out that the military had been hollowed by Bill Clinton. It was a revelation that was late in coming, and it is a shame on the Joint Chiefs of Staff that they let it run for so long. 
   So in 1999, led, I am proud to say, by the Republican Congress, we actually increased defense spending in real terms for the first time since Bill Clinton had been President. 
   Now, in his final budget submission, President Clinton, as he is heading toward the exit, having cut defense consistently since he became President--even counting the increase Congress added last year, real defense outlays have been cut by 17 percent--now, in his parting budget, President Clinton proposed $16 billion of increases in defense spending. 
   We might have celebrated that fact--having written a budget that added $16 billion and expanded our modernization programs, improved health care for our active duty military and for our retirees--there are many good things we could do with that $16 billion--but Congress was not going to be outdone. How dare Bill Clinton, in the final hours that he has in the White House, submit a massive increase in defense spending and have Congress just say yes. 
   So remarkably, we find ourselves today in a situation where the President proposed a $16 billion increase, Congress has raised that by another $14 billion, and, as a result, we have over a 10-percent increase in defense spending in 1 year. I would submit that this is political upmanship that makes absolutely no sense. What has happened is, the surplus is literally burning a hole in our pockets. 
   The picture is actually worse because there are all kinds of gimmicks in the bill that would allow more to be spent. You might wonder how $2 billion that nobody voted on in either House of Congress could be added in conference. Let me explain how it happened. In fact, I am sure people wonder: Where do these emergencies come from? Every week or so now, they are seeing Congress pass an emergency funding bill. And they might ask: Where do these emergencies come from? 
   On page 54 of this Defense appropriations bill, we have an emergency created. This is how it happened. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, in section 8166, cut spending for the 
   Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund by $1.1 billion. 
   They took the $1.1 billion out of the appropriations bill, and then, in title IX, they added it back, but this time as an emergency. So, in the middle of page 54, an emergency is created, by taking money away from needed expenditures on American overseas contingency operations--we take the money away in the middle of page 54--then we spend this money on all of these programs that Senator MCCAIN is talking about, and then, at the bottom of page 54, we add it back because we have an emergency. 
   Well, where did the emergency come from? The emergency came from the fact that they took the money from overseas operations to spend on other things. That is where the emergency came from. 
   So they created the emergency in the middle of page 54, and then at the bottom of page 54, having created a crisis--we might have to bring troops home from Kosovo as a result of the money taken in the middle of page 54--so at the bottom of page 54, having created the emergency in the middle of the page, they then solve the emergency by taking exactly the same amount of money, declaring it an emergency so it does not count under the budget, and adding it back. 
   It, I think, speaks volumes that Senator MCCAIN looked at this bill, and I looked at this bill, and we both came up with a list of programs that we thought were indefensible. We never talked about our choice of programs, but there is not a single overlap on our lists. That tells me we were picking from a large bushel basket full of add-ons. 
   Let me give you a few that I think deserve a prize. Five million dollars is earmarked out of Army operations and maintenance. I remind my colleagues, this is an area where we have a critical shortage of funding, where we have provided emergency money in the past. In clear violation of the base closing law--which says, when you close a military base you can't keep building infrastructure on that military base; when you have closed it, when you have transferred it to the civilian sector, you can't keep spending defense money on it--in clear violation of the base closing law, we provide $5 million, which we transfer to the National Park Service, to build infrastructure on a base that has been closed. 
   No. 2, we provide $4 million to monitor desert tortoise populations. Remember, we are taking $4 million out of the defense budget. In fact, we declared an emergency when we took the money away from overseas operations, and then we put it back in for an emergency so we could fund programs such as monitoring desert tortoise populations. 
   It is interesting, when you press, to learn what the justification is. The justification, you will be happy to know, is that we may, at some point, want to expand a military base, and the desert tortoise population might be relevant. 
   I remind my colleagues, we are closing military bases. Nevertheless, in this bill, with all of our needs, we found room to provide defense money to monitor the desert tortoise population in California. 
   Because we have a huge backlog in depot maintenance for our ships in the Navy, this Congress has provided $362 million of emergency money to try to deal with this backlog in ship maintenance so our ships can perform their missions. In this bill, we take $750,000 out of that emergency money and use it for renovations on the U.S.S. Turner Joy. Senator MCCAIN will be one of the few people here who will remember the U.S.S. Turner Joy. It is a destroyer. It is well known because it was involved in the Tonkin Gulf action that got us deeper into Vietnam. But it has been out of the Navy since 1982. We are providing $362 million on an emergency basis to catch up with ship maintenance, and yet we are basically giving a tourist bureau money to do renovation on a ship that has been out of the Navy since 1982. 
   There is $5.5 million for an Army research and development project. This is money meant for modernization so if we have to send men and women into combat, they will have technological superiority. We use this $5.5 million for laser vision correction. Laser vision  correction is a miracle. They can come in and do it, and you don't have to wear glasses anymore. But the point is, what does that have to do with national defense? Why are we funding medical research out of the national defense budget? 
   Then there is $2.8 million to buy new office furniture for the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA. At first you might say, OK, we built a new building; we have to buy new furniture. But there isn't a new building. We are not building a new building at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, CA. The question is: Why do we need new furniture now? What is wrong with the old furniture? The answer: The surplus is burning a hole in our pocket. This is a grab bag. It is like one of these sales you see on television where they dump the clothes on a table and they are on sale, and everybody grabs a piece of it. 
   Finally, $3.5 million is added in Army research, development, test, and evaluation for artificial hip research. Now look, artificial hip research is important. There are people who have deteriorating joints. We fund research at the National Institutes of Health to deal with health problems. What are we doing taking $3.5 million out of defense to fund this kind of activity? 
   I will conclude on this: We took $1.1 billion out of defense. We declared an emergency because we didn't have enough defense money. Then, having declared an emergency and gotten the money, then we take the $1.1 billion that was supposed to be spent on defense and spend it on other things. As a result, we literally have an almost endless list of projects exactly like these. You have to ask yourself, is this really the best use for the taxpayers' money? 
   I say to my colleagues, I am going to vote against this Defense bill because this is runaway spending at its worst. I voted against other bills because of the obscene way we literally are throwing money at these appropriated accounts. In this election year, with many close elections, we literally are spending money on anything that might have a constituency. This process has got to stop. I think it undermines the good work we are doing. 
   I thank Senator STEVENS. We have been working to resolve a disagreement over two unnecessary pay shifts. Senator STEVENS has agreed--graciously, I might add--to fix that. But I am going to vote against this bill on the basis under which we are today considering it. I am going to vote against this bill because you cannot defend this kind of runaway spending. The only defense I've heard is that, in a big bill, you are going to take on some spending. I don't think that is good enough.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if we were beginning to write a farm budget this year, these arguments might resonate. The problem is we have already spent $9.6 billion that required budget waivers so far this year: Spending some of it in the year 2000, and spending some of it in the year 2001, but all of it where we made a commitment to spend this year. 
   What is really happening is we are in the process of simply throwing the budget out the window. We are in the process of letting this budget surplus literally burn a hole in our pockets. The level of scratching and clawing to get into the pockets of the Federal Government is at a level I have never experienced in the 22 years I have served in Congress. 
   It seems to me if this provision were meritorious in a bill that is providing  $14.85 billion of discretionary assistance to farmers and ranchers, it would have found a place. In fact, this bill, in addition to the $1.4 billion of crop insurance, $1.6 billion in emergency assistance, the $5.5 billion of loss assistance, the $1.1 billion this bill has for emergencies--if we adopt this amendment, we are saying that a full $10.5 billion of emergency spending in agriculture will be expended this year when the entire nonemergency part of the bill is $14.85 billion. In other words, we have about a 66-percent increase in spending, all in the name of emergency. 
   I have to say I believe this has gone too far. We are all interested in helping farmers and ranchers. We all know there are problems, but every year the President proposes a level of assistance, Republicans raise it, Democrats raise it more, and then our Democrat colleagues raise it again. Is there no limit to the amount of money we are willing to spend because we have this surplus? 
   Obviously, I cannot address every issue raised by every Senator, but one has to ask the question: When 50 cents out of every dollar going to farmers in America is coming from the Government, what is going on in America today? 
   It is very interesting to me, and I just put these figures out here and pose a question: If we are having a complete agricultural disaster, if farmers are going broke left and right, if we should be spending almost 70 percent of our ag budget in emergency add-on spending, what would you expect to be happening to farm debt? Given that we have a 70-percent cost over-run to ``help the farmer,'' what would you think is happening to farm debt? What would you think is happening to the level of farm assets? What would you think is happening to the debt-to-asset ratio?--in other words, the amount of debt farmers have relative to their assets. 
   When we have allowed emergency spending to reach levels unprecedented in the history of this country, when we have made emergency appropriations in agriculture the norm, when we have had a bidding war to buy votes in rural America such as this country has never seen in its history because of all of these losses, what would you think is happening to farm debt? 
   Let me just give you the figures: Farm debt in 1998 was $172.9 billion. In 1999, it was $172.8 billion. This year, it is projected to be $172.5 billion. 
   With all of this economic disaster, with this destruction such as we have not seen since Steinbeck novels, somehow, remarkably, farm debt is going down and not up. Yet we cannot spend money fast enough. There is just not enough money in the world to meet the demand we have for it. 
   What would you think is happening to farm assets? Farmers going broke left and right, leaving the farm, disaster, the trails, the trucks going to California, the desertion, the disaster in rural America--what do you think is happening to farm assets? They must be plummeting. They must be in a complete free-fall. 
   Oddly enough, not only are they not plummeting, they are going up. They were $1.0643 trillion in 1998, $1.0672 trillion in 1999, and they are projected to be $1.0728 trillion this year. 
   If there is such absolute calamity in agriculture in America today, why are assets going up, and not down? 
   Finally, with all of this burgeoning debt--farmers drowning in debt; the mortgage collector at the door; the mean, cold-hearted banker beating on the farm door, foreclosing mortgages; widows being put out on the lawn on our farms--what do you think has happened to the debt-to-asset ratio in agriculture? It was $16.2 billion in 1998, $16.2 billion in 1999, and $16.1 billion today. 
   What is wrong with this picture? We are saying that the world is collapsing in rural America, and we are spending at rates unprecedented in the history of this country to deal with a calamity; and yet farm debt is going down, farm assets are going up, and the debt-to-asset ratio in agricultural America is actually going down. 
   Now look, something is wrong here. 
   What is wrong with this picture? I will tell you what is wrong with this picture. The obscene actions that have been taken in this Congress. There seems to be no limit to what we are willing to spend in the name of agriculture. I think it has to stop. I can't judge the merits of this case, this $70 million, that $115 million, the next $117 million, $4 million, $600,000----

   Mr. GRAMM. The $45 million, $40 million, $59.4 million, $2.5 million, $6 million, $50 million, $450 million, $7.2 million--these are all emergencies that, when we funded the three previous emergencies, did not make it into the stack. When this bill was written, in a committee that is not known for turning a cold, dead eye to suffering farmers and ranchers, this $900 million never made it into the stack. 
   But here we are, on a Thursday afternoon, at 7:20 p.m., and we are talking about $900 million--$900 million of spending that was not in the budget, that was not in the appropriations bill, that requires a waiver of the Budget Act, and that requires the designation of an emergency. 
   I am saying, in $10 billion of emergency spending and $14.85 billion of ordinary spending--out of $25 billion that we are spending--how come there was not room for this $900 million? How come we are suddenly dealing with it at 7:25 p.m. tonight? 
   I think the answer is as clear as the answer can be. The answer is, we are determined we are going to spend every penny we can spend. We are turning our budget process into an absolute laughing stock. We are proving that all somebody has to do is walk down to the floor on Thursday evening and offer an amendment, spending millions of dollars, and it is great. 
   We are asked: Have you lost compassion? Look, I have plenty of compassion. But how much compassion is enough? How much do we have to spend on these programs? This year, we have already spent almost $10 billion in agricultural programs that required a budget waiver. We are already to the point where half of all net farm income is coming from a check from Washington, DC. Where does it end? 
   Final point--I have talked too long--but today, when we had Alan Greenspan before the Banking Committee, he was asked whether or not he was concerned about the fact that if you take the appropriation growth we had this year and project it for 10 years, it is over $1 trillion in new spending. We are realistically debating a new entitlement that, when fully implemented for 10 years, would cost about $750 billion. He said he was very concerned about it, that he thought it represented a potential threat to the economy. 
   So I am not saying that all of these things are without merit. I am just saying: When does it end? When does it stop? How much is enough? Is $10 billion of emergency spending--almost 70 percent above the normal level of spending--is that not enough? 
   I think these are real questions that need to be answered. I think it is important that we stop these amendments. And they may be adopted. Look, I understand the votes may be here to adopt them. But they are going to be adopted individually. And they are going to be subject to a point of order. We are going to begin to resist. This has to end somewhere. It seems to me that this is the place where we need to begin to talk about it ending. 
   I, quite frankly, was willing to accept all of these so-called emergencies already in the bill, but this just goes beyond the limits of endurance, in my opinion. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank Senator STEVENS for agreeing to this amendment. I realize that there are legitimate emergencies, but I remind my colleagues that in the last 2 years we have had $16.6 billion of agricultural emergencies. This amendment does not guarantee that we are not going to have more. But it certainly strengthens the ability of those who want to draw the line and say that enough is enough. 
   So I support this agreement. I thank Senator STEVENS and Senator COCHRAN.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, at this time of shock and loss we tend to focus on PAUL's death, but it seems to me that it is really a time that we should focus on his life. As we weigh how our lives and the life of our Nation has been diminished by the loss of PAUL COVERDELL, I think it is important that we also reflect on how our lives have been enriched. 
   I first--I first met PAUL COVERDELL when I went to Georgia. He was campaigning for the Senate. And he was doing an event in this dingy old steel mill about industrial renewal. I had  talked to him on the phone, I was--I was chairman of the Senatorial Committee, but I had not seen him in action. So I got up and spoke, and then PAUL got up and spoke in that squeaky voice, and he sort of had a way of jumping up and down when he was speaking and waving his hands, so I tried to delicately whisper to him, quit jumping up and down, be still, but little did I know at that moment that with all of his outward appearance and the squeaky voice, that this man had the heart of a lion. 
   He went on and won in that campaign. As chairman of the Senatorial Committee I was involved in 67 Senate campaigns. And he won the toughest race, defeated an incumbent, was in a runoff after the general election when everybody else would have sat down, given up, gotten tired.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, one of the things I am afraid of is that many people following this debate will get confused about what we are talking about, why we are here, and what the issue is before us. I thought I would come over one more time before the weekend and basically try to outline what it is we are talking about. Many amendments are being offered. Our Democrat colleagues would not let us just bring up repeal of the marriage penalty and vote on it. They insisted on having the ability to offer amendments on scores of different issues. So I know it may be confusing as people listen to the debate. 
   Let me talk about what the issue is, where those of us stand on repealing the marriage tax penalty, what we believe we have to do regarding that; and then I want to talk a little bit about what the President has proposed as an alternative. 
   I don't know that anybody ever intended that American tax law penalize working people who get married. But today, when two people, both of whom work outside their home, meet, fall in love, get married, and pay their taxes, they pay, on average, $1,400 a year for the right to be married. 
   Now, I hope and believe that if you asked most American couples if it is worth $1,400 a year to them to be married, I think most of them would say it is. I can say, without any reservation, that my wife is worth $1,400 a year, and a bargain at that. 
   But I believe she ought to get the money, and not bureaucrats in Washington, DC. 
   How did this all come about? You have to remember when the Tax Code was written that relatively few women worked outside the home. It was structured in such a way as to try to achieve various objectives. 
   But the bottom line is we have two problems today. 
   The first problem is, if you are single and you file your tax return, you get a standard deduction of $4,400. If you have a young man and a young woman, or not such a young man and not such a young woman, and they are single and filing separately, and don't itemize deductions, each one of them gets a standard deduction of $4,400. If they meet, fall in love, and get married, they end up getting a joint return standard deduction of $7,350--obviously, much less than $8,800, which would be twice the single deduction of $4,400. If you meet, fall in love, and get married, the amount of income you get to deduct before you start paying taxes is actually less after you are married than it is before. 
   Second, the income of the second spouse is added directly to the income of the first spouse. 
   What tends to happen is two people who, as singles, are in the 15-percent tax bracket meet, fall in love and get married, and end up in the 28-percent tax bracket. Hence, when you combine the discrimination in the tax law against married couples as compared to singles on the standard deduction, and when you look at pushing people into these higher tax brackets more quickly when they are married than when they were singled, the result is a marriage tax penalty which averages $1,400 each year. 
   We want the remedy to be very simple. We want to repeal the marriage penalty. We think this is not just an economic issue, we think it is a moral issue. We think even the greatest country in the history of the world is treading dangerously when it has policies that discourage people from forming families. We are not here to give any kind of sermon on families and the values of families, but the plain truth is the modern family is the most powerful institution in history for happiness and economic progress, and we don't think our Government, of all governments, should be trifling with it. 
   Our reform says, whereas single people get a $4,400 standard deduction, we will give a married couple $8,800. We want to change the tax brackets so that if two people get married who are in the 15-percent tax bracket as singles, they will still be in the 15-percent tax bracket after they get married; or, if they are in the 28-percent tax bracket, they are still in the 28-percent tax bracket after they get married. 
   You would think you could look throughout the continent of North America and not find a single soul who thought the marriage tax penalty was a good idea. But, unfortunately, we have a President and we have Members of this very Congress who may say they are not for it but they are opposed to getting rid of it. 
   They are opposed to getting rid of it for a very simple reason. They believe they can spend this money better than families. They believe if we repeal the marriage penalty and working couples get to keep $1,400 a year more of their own income to invest in their own family, in their own future, and in their own children, that those families will do a poorer job with that money than the Government will do if the Government gets to spend it. They really believe that the Government can spend it better. 
   Our President and many of our Democrat colleagues, honest to goodness, in their hearts, believe it is wrong to give this $1,400 back to people by eliminating the marriage penalty because they believe that Government could spend the money so much better than families could spend it. 
   While they believe that, they don't feel comfortable saying it 
   because they don't believe the American people will agree with them. 
   So what do they say? What does our President say? He doesn't say: Look, don't give this money back to families. They will spend it on their children.  They will spend it on houses. They might buy a new refrigerator. They might go on vacation. They might send their children to Texas A&M. Let the Government spend it. But they do not say that. Our President is many things, but dumb is not one of them. He is very smart. So he says it is rich people--that we are trying to give money to rich people. 
   There is a code that you need to understand about our President and many people in his party. The code is that every tax increase is on rich people and every tax cut is for rich people; therefore, you always want to raise taxes but you never want to cut taxes. 
   I want to remind you--I am sure people who are listening to this debate are going to hear our President speak on the issue within a week after we send this bill down to the White House. The President is going to have to decide whether to sign it. I suspect he is going to say: I wanted to eliminate the marriage penalty. I am against the marriage penalty. It is just that I didn't want to do it for rich people. 
   Let me remind people that this is the same President who, when he raised taxes in 1993, looked us right in the eye over the television, and said: No one who is not rich will pay more taxes under my tax bill. Then he raised gasoline taxes on everybody. I guess maybe everybody who drives a truck, or a car, or uses gasoline in some way to travel or go to work is rich. 
   Then there was the even more grievous example where the President taxed people's Social Security benefits if they earned over $34,000 a year, because if you earn over $34,000 a year, according to the President, you are rich. 
   Here is an example I wanted to make. I think it is so priceless. Let me make it a couple of times to be sure I get it right. 
   The President says he wants to get rid of the marriage penalty but he doesn't want to do it for rich people. So what he proposes is raising the standard deduction if both people work. If one of them doesn't work, or one of them doesn't make as much money, he doesn't raise it or doesn't raise it as much. I am going to get back to that. But he doesn't expand the 15-percent bracket so that married people don't end up paying in the 28-percent tax bracket with the same incomes that were taxed at 15-percent when they were single. He says his plan just eliminates the marriage penalty for people who are not rich--that our plan eliminates it for people who are rich. 
   It is very interesting. For a couple filing a tax return, they move into the 28-percent tax bracket at a combined income of $43,850. If you want to know whether you are rich or not by the definition of our President, if you make $21,925 a year and your wife makes $21,925, according to Bill Clinton, you are rich. 
   I ask a question: Does anybody really believe that somebody making $21,925 a year is rich? I don't think anybody really believes that. Why does Bill Clinton say that? He says it because he is not willing to say what he really believes, which is, it is fine to penalize people for getting married, because he may not necessarily like it or enjoy it, but it is all right to do that and make them pay the marriage penalty of $1,400 a year because the Government can do such a good job spending that money and the family would probably waste it. 
   Let me mention two other issues. Then I will yield the floor. 
   The President says if both spouses are not working, they ought not to get the benefit. We reject that. 
   First of all, anybody who thinks stay-home parents don't work has never been a stay-home parent. Anybody who thinks you are getting a tax bonus by staying at home to raise your children is somebody who doesn't understand families too well, because most families make tremendous economic sacrifices to have one parent stay home with their children. Yet the President runs around and says when one of the parents doesn't work outside the home, they are getting a bonus. Forgoing income and sacrificing to raise children is only called a bonus in Washington, DC. In most places it is called parenting. 
   We want to eliminate the marriage penalty because we think there is one institution in America that is constantly starved for resources. It is not the Federal Government. 
   As many of our colleagues know, we are in the greatest spending spree of the Federal Government since Jimmy Carter was President. We are increasing money for all kinds of Government programs. The President would like to increase it faster, and he is concerned that, if we let families not pay a marriage penalty, that $1,400 per family they will spend instead of him, means that we will not have as much money for education, housing, or nutrition. 
   What the President forgets is, What are families going to spend this money on? If we eliminate the marriage penalty and let working couples keep $1,400 a year more, what are they going to spend it on? They are going to spend it on education, housing, and nutrition. The question is not about how much money we are going to spend on all these things we are for. The question is, Who is going to do the spending? Bill Clinton wants Washington to do the spending. We want the family to do the spending. 
   On the issue of one parent staying at home, this is something we have thought about, worked on, prayed over. Here is the decision we have reached. We don't think Government tax policy ought to have a say in the decision that parents make about working outside the home or staying in their homes. My mama worked my whole life when I was growing up because she had to. My wife has worked the whole while that we have had children because she wanted to. 
   We are not trying to make a value judgment as to what people ought to do. So basically we say we want to eliminate the marriage penalty, whether both parents work outside the home or whether only one does. We do not think we ought to have a tax policy that discourages a parent staying home, or encourages it. We think the Tax Code ought to be neutral. 
   So we have put together a proposal that eliminates the marriage penalty. The President says it helps rich people because, if you make over $21,925 a year, you get the benefit of our stretching the tax brackets. We do not believe that is what most people think of as rich. 
   Finally, to address the ``rich'' issue, our point is not about poor people or rich people or ordinary people. Our point is about penalizing marriage. If two people are poor and meet and fall in love, I want them to get married. If two people are rich and they meet and they fall in love and they want to get married, I don't want the tax code to discourage them from getting married. This is a question of right and wrong. It is not a question of rich and poor. 
   I don't understand why the President has to always pit people against each other based on how much money they make. I would have to say of all the things we do in debate in the Congress and in the American political system, the thing I dislike the most is this use of class struggle, where somehow we have people who claim to love capitalism, but appear to hate capitalists. They claim to want success, but seem to hate people who are successful. I, for one, do not understand it. 
   I want to repeal the marriage penalty for everybody. The plain truth is the bulk of the cost of eliminating the marriage penalty is for middle-income people. But I want to eliminate it for everybody because it is wrong. 
   Finally, if we did not eliminate all of it, what do we think would happen the first time we have a President and a Congress who want to raise taxes? We would be back down to the point where $21,925 is rich. So this is a very important debate. 
   This last week, and today, repealing the death tax, and on Monday, repealing the marriage penalty tax, represents the best 2 weeks that American families have had in a very long time. These are good policies. They are good because they are right. They are good because they are profamily. They are good because they recognize that families can spend money better than Government can. 
   They are good because they represent the triumph of the individual and the family over the Government. 
   I have to say I wish that every American could have heard the debate on the death tax and on the marriage penalty. I would be willing to let this election and every election from now until the end of time be determined on these two issues and these two issues alone  because I think these two issues clearly define the difference between our two great parties. 
   I am against the death tax because I don't think death ought to be a taxable event. And I am against the marriage penalty because I am for love and I am for marriage and I don't want to tax it. And neither do the American people. 
   I thank my colleagues for their patience and I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Then I will take 5 minutes, and I will yield 5 minutes to my colleague. 
   Mr. President, I could not help but hear Senator KENNEDY talking about the need for education. I would like to remind my colleagues that we and a Republican Congress spent more on education last year than the President asked for. 
   Our colleague from New Mexico talks about priorities. Bill Clinton, in his budget, calls for over a trillion dollars of new spending over the next 10 years. Not one Democrat raises any concern about spending the surplus. We propose $100 billion to eliminate the death tax, one-tenth the amount Bill Clinton wants to spend on new programs, and they are up in arms, outraged. 
   Now, this is about priorities. What are we trying to do? We are trying to eliminate a situation where, every day, working Americans build up farms and build up businesses with sweat equity. They save and sacrifice, and they work long hours. They pay taxes on every dollar they earn. And then, when they die, the Government comes in and forces their children to sell the business or sell the family farm, and we think it is wrong. We think it is un-American, we think it is immoral, and we are going to eliminate it. 
   When you get down to the bottom line, there are two reasons our Democrat colleagues disagree. Number one, our Democrat colleagues exactly within the context of this amendment say: Look. Force people to sell the family farm when papa dies. Force people to sell their business because by them giving that money to the Government, the Government can spend it better. We don't agree. We think families can spend it better--not the Government. 
   The second argument is an argument we often hear from the Democrat side: We are talking about rich people. These are rich people. 
   I don't understand our Democrat colleagues. They profess to love capitalism but they hate capitalists. Many of them are rich but they hate rich people. 
   Let me try to boil this down to its basic point because I only have a couple of minutes. The only thing I was ever bequeathed in my life and ever will be was when my great-uncle Bill, my grandma's brother, left me a cardboard suitcase full of yellow sports clippings. If it had been baseball cards, I would be a rich man today.  
   Our agriculture commissioner in Texas owns a ranch that her family worked for four generations. When her dad died, she had to sell a third of that ranch to pay a death tax. 
   How does that help me? How did forcing her to sell off her family's ranch that had been in her family for four generations help me or help my family? How does tearing down one family build up another? We don't think it does. 
   That is what this issue comes down to. We believe when people work, build up a business, or build up a farm, or build up assets, and they pay taxes on it, that it ought then to belong to them and to their children, whether they are rich or whether they are not rich. 
   I think it is important to note that our colleagues, when they use all of those little examples, leave out one important thing. Over the next 10 years, the revenues collected on this tax are going to quadruple. Why? Because of all of those teacher retirement programs. Many college professors are going to retire with $1 million in their investment accounts. I thank God for it. If they die before they can spend it, under current law, their children are going to end up having to give part of that retirement program to the Government. I think it is absolutely wrong and outrageous. 
   We are down to making a choice. They say don't eliminate the death tax--just raise the cap a little. Why do we need to eliminate it? When you have a cancer, you don't cut out half of it. You cut out the whole thing. 
   Have we forgotten that when Bill Clinton was writing the 1993 tax bill he floated trial balloons about lowering the deduction from $600,000 to $200,000? 
   Does anyone doubt, if we don't repeal the death tax and if we ever have a Democrat President and a Democrat Congress again, that the first thing they are going to do is lower the deduction back down to the point where ordinary working families, farmers, ranchers, and small business people will pay this tax? I don't doubt it. I want to cut it out by the roots. 
   That is what this vote is about.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will be brief in my 5 minutes. 
   First, I know the Senator from Massachusetts is sincere about this amendment, but I remind my colleagues of a few key points. We are here to repeal the death tax. All over America, families work, sacrifice, save, and through sweat equity build up businesses, farms, and assets. Then they die, and the Government, because they die, taxes their life's work even though they paid taxes on every dollar they earned. Too often in America, their children have to sell the farm or sell the business to give the Government up to 55 cents out of every dollar they earn. Republicans believe that is unfair, that is un-American, and that is immoral. 
   Our colleague from Massachusetts calls getting rid of this tax a windfall. If your parents worked a lifetime to build up a farm, and they were there when it was dry and they had droughts, they were there when there were floods and when the hail killed the crops, and they saved and sacrificed, and they did it so their children could some day run that farm, I do not call that a windfall. That is just a fundamental difference in philosophy. 
   There are two big-time problems with this amendment. No. 1, it sets up this new trust fund not out of taxes that were raised to pay for this activity but basically by requiring people to sell off the family farm or sell off the family business to fund this trust fund. 
   The second problem is, there is no point of order against it. One might ask why is that true of amendments that have been offered that spend money. It is true because this amendment takes $5 billion that the Finance Committee was allocated to do something else with. For what were they allocated the money? They were allocated the money to repeal the marriage penalty for people who receive the earned-income tax credit. That is what this $5 billion was for. 
   A janitor with three children meets a waitress with two children. They fall in love, and they find the solution to their problems. Only, under the marriage penalty, they both end up losing the earned-income tax credit, and they end up in the 28-percent tax bracket if they get married. 
   We are planning to use the $5 billion that Senator KERRY would use to fund this trust fund to repeal the marriage penalty for the lowest income individuals to be sure they do not lose their earned-income tax credit if they meet, fall in love, and get married. 
   Senator KERRY is trying to do a very good thing, but unfortunately there is something I think is of a higher order: repealing the marriage penalty for poor people and not taking away their earned-income tax credit. Senator KERRY is inadvertently taking this money from that purpose. 
   So ultimately you come down to choices. The choice he would make is: Sell the family farm, sell the family business, and let the Government have that money; and, secondly, the money you were going to take--that $5 billion that we gave the Finance Committee in the budget to repeal the marriage penalty for low-income people, by changing the earned-income tax credit, where they do not lose it if they get married to somebody who also works--the net result of this is, sell the farm, sell the business, and take away the earned-income tax credit from the janitor and the waitress who have a total of five children, who met, fell in love, wanted to get married, and who saw it as a solution to their problem. But Senator KERRY will be sure they get subsidized housing. I do not think it is a good swap. I do not think it is a good trade. So on another day, on another issue maybe, but not today. 
   Finally, let me remind my colleagues, if they are worried about housing--and we would be if we did not have a house--that we have a $1.9 billion increase in the 2000 budget for housing, $25.9 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development--and that is a 7-percent increase. Very few families in America had a 7-percent increase in their income last year. 
   So it is a good amendment--well-intended--but we should reject it.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, I note the incredible paradox that this wonderful amendment offered by our dear colleague from Connecticut was in the Republican tax bill that Bill Clinton vetoed last year. I wish our colleagues had supported that bill, and I wish they had helped us override the President's veto. 
   I have two simple responses here. One, it is true that if you count up the number of people affected by his amendment, Senator DODD has more numbers. But the point is, he is asking us to forgo repealing the death tax so that families will continue to work a lifetime to build up a business or a family farm, pay taxes on every dollar they earn; yet, when they die, their children have to sell off the farm or the business in order to give this tax to the Government. We would repeal the tax. He would take funds from it for another purpose. 
   So when we talk about somebody's home, somebody's farm, somebody's business, and the fact that there are a larger number of people who would like to have their home or business, I am not surprised by that, nor am I overwhelmed by it. Almost any robber anywhere would say, ``I had six children and he had two; I had a gun and he had a wallet.'' 
   That is my first point. 
   My second point is that the $5 billion they spend here is $5 billion that was allocated to the Finance Committee to allow us to repeal the marriage penalty for people who get the earned-income tax credit. 
   There was no point of order against this amendment because it has taken the $5 billion that we were going to use in repealing the marriage penalty to see that people who get the earned-income tax credit don't lose that earned-income tax credit when they get married. 
   Let me give you an example. A janitor with three children meets a waitress with two children. They are both working. They are both low income. They both get the earned-income tax credit. They meet and they fall in love. They have the answers to their prayers--a father for the children and a mother for the children. They get married. What happens? They both lose their earned-income tax credit. They are in the 28-percent tax bracket. So, as a result, they decide not to get married. 
   It is a crazy policy. We want to repeal it. We are going to repeal it tomorrow. 
   But our ability to fund the earned-income tax credit so they can keep the earned-income tax credit and not move into the 28-percent bracket is made possible by the $5 billion that this amendment will take away from the Finance Committee. 
   The question you have to ask is not does the Senator's amendment do any good. It does good. But the question is, Is it worth taking away the earned-income tax credit from working poor people who are trying to better their lives? Is it worth forcing people to sell their farm and sell their business that their parents spent a lifetime building up as a way of funding it? 
   I think this is a proposal that has merit. We wrote it into the Republican tax package last year that the President vetoed. But I don't think we ought to eliminate EITC relief for working people who get married to fund this proposal, which is what it does. 
   Second, the amendment also keeps part of the death tax in place. Why is that dangerous? They argue that at least we are reducing it. They are. But do you remember in 1993 when the President was putting together his tax increase, and one of the ideas he floated was lowering the deduction from $600,000 to $200,000? 
   Does anybody doubt that unless we kill the death tax, get rid of it and pull it out by the roots, that the next time we have a Democrat President and a Democrat Congress we are going to end up as we were in 1993 with this deduction back down to $600,000, $400,000, or $200,000?

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what we are talking about here is basically a setting of priorities. Do we want to take money away from eliminating the marriage penalty in the earned-income tax credit for working families to give a tax credit for a noble purpose? In fact, a purpose that we had written into our tax bill last year that the President vetoed. That is what we are debating: priorities. 
   We set aside the $5 billion in the budget to fund earned-income tax credit for the elimination of the marriage penalty. If we spend it here, we cannot do it tomorrow.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, our colleagues have just introduced the Gore plan to extend Social Security by giving the Social Security Administration a bunch of new IOUs. Of course, the IOUs are from the same Government that is going to have to pay the Social Security benefits in the future. 
   We currently have $800 billion of paper IOUs in a steel filing cabinet in West Virginia. They represent the trust fund of Social Security. When Social Security takes in more taxes than it spends, this computer in West Virginia prints out this IOU, and the Government goes on about its business and spends the money on something else. That something else can be any other Government program, or buying down the debt of the Treasury. But the Social Security Administration gets the IOUs. 
   What we are hearing here is a new gimmick, where you give them the IOU and then maybe you buy down debt, maybe not, but you still give them another IOU. Then that IOU earns interest and you get another IOU. 
   Let me go back and start at the beginning. Let me quote President Clinton in his year 2000 budget. I know it is late, but I hope my colleagues will listen to this quote.  
   These Social Security trust fund balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only in a bookkeeping sense. These funds are not set up to be pension funds, like the funds of private pension plans. They do not consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing the benefits--  
   Which means cutting Social Security benefits--   
   or other expenditures. The existence of large trust fund balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on the Government's ability to pay benefits.  
   That is not me talking. That is President Bill Clinton from his fiscal year 2000 budget. What is he saying? This $800 billion of Government IOUs we have represents a debt of Government. So when the Government has to pay Social Security benefits in the future, they have an IOU and they can collect it. But who has to pay it? The same Government that collects it. 
   It is why I cannot write an IOU and put it on my balance sheet. The Senator from Oklahoma, when he was running Nickles Machine Corporation, could not inflate his balance sheet by simply adding another IOU. President Clinton clearly explains that. 
   Our Vice President is saying: OK, I want to make Social Security solvent for 50 more years--I do not know why he did not do 100 or 500--and the way I am going to do it is I am going to print up these IOUs that say the Government owes the Government money, and they are going to put the IOUs in that filing cabinet in West Virginia. 
   Here is the problem. When they get them out to cash and they say: OK, this IOU is for $100 billion; we will pay benefits with this. Who is going to pay the $100 billion? The Government has to pay the $100 billion. To quote Bill Clinton, they have to raise taxes, borrow from the public, they have to reduce benefits, which is cut Social Security benefits, or they have to cut other expenditures. The point being this is a totally fraudulent proposal. It simply acts as if you can pay benefits that the Government owes with an IOU that the Government owes. 
   The problem is there is no way the Government, with its own debt, can pay anybody benefits because it has to pay its own debt first. All the Vice President is proposing is that we commit future income taxes to pay benefits in the future. How does that in any way improve the solvency of Social Security? It does not, and this whole proposal should be rejected.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this has been a great debate. I count myself privileged to have the opportunity to close it. 
   I am proud of my colleague from Texas. If Members were not moved by the story the Senator portrayed, of people being forced to sacrifice their homes to keep their family farm together, then they don't have a heart and they don't care about the values that at least I consider to be the underpinnings of America. 
   No issue better defines the difference between the two great political parties than this issue. I am prepared to have every election in American history determined on this issue and this issue alone. The issue is very simple. People work their whole lives, they pay taxes on every dollar they earn; they scrimp, they save, they sacrifice, and they build up a business or they build up a family farm, and, when they die, they pass that business or that farm on to their children. In fact, that is the reason many people work and sacrifice. 
   My mama didn't graduate from high school, but she had a dream I was going to college. She sacrificed her whole life to achieve that dream. We don't believe that, when people have worked a lifetime to build up a family farm, or family business, or family assets, that their children ought to have to sell off their parents' life's work to give the Government up to 55 cents out of every dollar of everything they have accumulated in their lives. We think it is fundamentally wrong. We think it is un-American. And we believe it ought to end. 
   When we cut through all the political rhetoric of everything our Democrat colleagues have said in this debate, their reasons for opposing repeal of the death tax come down to two arguments. The first argument is, force people to sell off that family business, force them to sell that family farm, force them to sell off the lifework of their parents because Government can spend the money better. 
   We reject that. We believe that is a clear indication that somehow the opponents of repeal don't understand what America is really about. Those of us who favor repeal of the death tax don't believe Government can spend that money better. And we don't think it is right to take it from the people who built those assets up. 
   The second argument our Democrat colleagues make in opposition to repealing the death tax is that repeal would help rich people. When we reduce this argument down, it is an argument that the Government ought to level families, that somehow if a person were born in a family that owned a family business or family farm, that is not fair--the fact that your parents sacrificed and worked and scrimped to  build it, it is still not fair for you have it, and at least part of it ought to be taken away from you. 
   Let me explain why I reject this logic. First of all, the only thing I have ever been bequeathed or expect to be bequeathed was, when my grandmama's brother, my great uncle Bill, died, he left me a cardboard suitcase full of sports clippings. Had it been baseball cards, I would be a rich man today. 
   The family of our agriculture commissioner in Texas, a lady named Susan Combs, owned a ranch that had been in the family for four generations. When her father died, she was forced to sell off part of that ranch to pay death taxes. Now our Democrat colleagues would have us believe that is good because that levels society. 
   How did it help me? How did making Susan Combs sell off ranchland that her family had owned for four generations help me because my family didn't own a ranch or didn't own a business? 
   I cannot see how I was helped, or how my children are helped. How does tearing down one family help build up another? How does destroying the life dream of one family build a life dream for another family? We do not believe it does. We think this is fundamentally wrong. 
   Granted, some rich people may benefit. But so will a lot more people who are not rich. I do not have any inherent objection to people being rich. If they didn't steal the money, if they worked hard for it, if they created jobs for people from families like I am from and they benefited from it, that is what America is about. I do not have a hate for rich people. I do not understand our Democrat colleagues who say they love capitalism but seem to hate capitalists, who claim to love progress but appear to harbor a distaste for the people who create it. We do not believe we can build up America by tearing down families. We believe we can build up America by giving people a chance to compete and use their God-given talents. But we don't want people to have to sell off their farm or sell off their business to give Government a new tax on money that has already been taxed. We do not think death ought to be a taxable event. 
   I congratulate those who have been involved in this debate. I think it is a good debate. I think it is a debate that defines what we stand for and what our Democrat colleagues stand for. We believe when you work a lifetime to build up a business or a family farm, it ought to be yours for keeps. If we are successful, we are going to kill the death tax--yes, you will still have to pay taxes on any gain if the business or farm is sold--but when you build up a family farm or build up a family business, it is yours for keeps. When you die, the people you built it for, your children, are going to get it. If you want to give it away, if you want to donate it to Texas A&M, that is God's work; or if you want to contribute it to trying to cure cancer, but you ought to get to decide how it is disposed of, not the Federal Government, not some bureaucrat at the IRS, and not some politician in Congress. That is what this debate is about. It is an important debate. I urge my colleagues, when we cast our votes on this bill, to vote to kill the death tax.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the conference report before us, I am unhappy to say, makes a mockery out of the budget. In fact, if we adopt this conference report, I think there is no need that we should ever adopt another budget. 
   This conference report violates every tenet of the budget we adopted. This conference report has two major phony spending shifts where we shift payments from the fiscal year we are appropriating for backwards into year 2000 so that we can spend an additional $4 billion in clear violation of the budget. I am sure you will hear Senator STEVENS saying that the defense of the Nation will be imperiled if we don't pass this bill. Yet while we are providing money to defense through this bill on an emergency basis, this bill takes $2 billion out of defense and gives it to nondefense, a total violation of the budget agreement that we struck. 
   It is Friday. My wife is waiting at the corner of First and C. But if we look the other way on this bill, then there is no budget, and we are going to totally lose control of spending.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will be brief. If we weren't at the end of the session with people on the way to the airport, I think we could have a debate on this issue and we could begin to raise 47 points of order against this bill. 
   The problem is that people would come in wanting to leave for the recess and basically understand that if they vote to override the points of order, they could go home for a week. Whereas, if they sustain the point of order, they could end up being here for further debate. So I urge my colleagues to allow us to agree that we will allow the bill to come up, waive all of our rights to have it read, and to delay it by other motions, have it come up the day we get back and we will have a debate. If we stay here and ruin everybody's week, we are going to harden hearts. When we get back to this bill--and it will not pass today. This bill is not going to pass today. If we harden hearts, we are going to come back here and spend a week when we might have a chance to work some of these things out, basically, in a strong-worded debate that will serve no interest. 
   I urge my colleagues to let us step aside, let the bill be brought up, waive reading it, but have it be brought up on Monday when we come back so we have an opportunity to legitimately make our case. If these were little trivial matters, then I would look the other way, swallow hard, and let it go. But these are not trivial matters. This is basically eliminating the entire budget that we adopted. I think if we do that, we are making a mockery out of the whole process. I am 
   not going to do it. So I object.

   Mr. GRAMM. I thank Senator NICKLES, whose leadership on this issue I think is without equal on any issue on which I have worked since I have been in the Senate. I know the people of Oklahoma, who Senator NICKLES represents, watch this on television at home. They wonder, what is this all about? You did, you didn't; you did, you didn't. This has to be confusing. 
   In the limited time I have, I want to set this debate in historical perspective so everybody knows what this is about. When Bill Clinton was elected President, he had a goal of having the Government take over and run the health care system. In fact, I have before me the Clinton health care bill. This would have mandated one giant, national HMO run by the Government; HMOs would set up health care collectives, and of course the right people would be chosen to decide what health care we all needed. 
   If you went to your doctor, he would have dictated, under the Clinton plan, the kind of treatment he could give. If he violated their guidelines because he thought you needed it, he would be fined $50,000. 
   If, under the Clinton health care bill, you went to a doctor and said, I don't think all these experts are right and my baby is sick, my baby could be dying, I will pay you to treat my baby, if the doctor did it, he could go to prison for 5 years. 
   That is the health care system my Democrat colleagues are for. The Members who were here voted for it and supported it. They know what they want. They want the Government to take over and run the health care system. They want to herd Americans into health care purchasing cooperatives, or collectives, as they call them, and you have to be a member or else you don't get health care in America. That is what they want. That is where this debate started. 
   Now, we are trying to give patients rights in dealing with HMOs. We want internal and external review. We want the external review to be independent. We want to guarantee them rights. But there is one fundamental difference between the Democrats and us. We think this is a delicate balance, because we don't want to drive up health care insurance costs so much that millions of people lose their health care. 
   Senator KENNEDY's bill was scored as driving up the cost of every person's health care in America by over 4 percent and costing 1.2 million American families their health insurance. What patient right is more basic than having health insurance? They give you lots of rights, but if you lose your health insurance, how do you pay for your health care? There is the difference between them and us. We have to be concerned about 1.2 million people losing their health care; they don't. 
   When Clinton said, let us take over and run the health care system and put everybody into these health care collectives, what did he say the problem was? The problem was that we had too many people without health insurance. So if their bill passed and millions of people lost their health insurance, what do you think they would say? They would say: We have a solution; the solution 
   is a government takeover of health care. 
   This job is easier for them than it is for us because they don't care if the baby dies, because they want to replace it. It reminds me of that story in the Bible. Some of you may remember it. Two ladies had gone to bed, and during the night one of them's baby had died and the other one had taken the baby. They come before Solomon. Solomon, in his wisdom, after listening to their arguments, says let's just cut the baby in half. That is what they are saying--cut the baby in half. Then one lady said: OK, cut the baby in half; and the other said: No, let her have the baby. Then Solomon knew whose baby it was. 
   This is our baby. We love freedom. We love the right of people to choose. We love the greatest health care system the world has ever known. We are not going to let the Government take over and run the health care system. That is what this debate is about. That is what our Democrat colleagues want. They are willing to destroy the greatest health care system the world has ever known because they want the health care system where the Government runs it. They think it would work better. We don't. Neither did America in 1993 and 1994, which is why we have a Republican majority today. 
   The second issue is scope. What does that mean? For those watching this on television, what does ``scope'' mean? What it means is, what should this Federal law do as it relates to the State in which you live? 
   Our Democrat colleagues believe with all their heart--they are as sincere as they can be--that there is only one place in the world where people have really any sense: Washington, DC. They think people in city governments and county governments and State governments are ignorant and uncaring. They believe Washington is brilliant, all-knowing, and all-caring. So what they want to do is write one bill in Washington and impose it on every living person in America. 
   We do not agree. We do not believe that just coming to Washington all of a sudden makes you brilliant. In fact, it is a long way from Washington to Wyoming. It is a long way from Washington to Texas. We joined the Union in Texas because we wanted freedom. We didn't join the Union to give it up. 
   What is the difference between the two bills? Their bill says we are going to write things the way we want them, and you are going to do it that way or we are going to come to your State, we are going to cut off your money, we are going to cut off your health care, and in some cases we are going to put you in jail. That is their way of doing it. You remember, in their bill if you went to this doctor, got down on your knees and begged that he take your money and treat your child, he went to prison for it; That was in their bill, the Clinton health care bill. 
   What we say is: Look, we will write a basic standard for patient protections.  But what if the people in Wyoming decide, since they don't have any HMOs--and this bill is about dealing with HMOs--that they should not have to come under the Federal Government to deal with a problem they don't have? They don't think they should. I don't they should either. 
   People in Tennessee and Texas were protecting patients before we got into this business. They passed comprehensive bills. All we are saying is our bill applies to those not already covered. But if people in Texas, through their government, through their elected Representatives, decide they appreciate our help, they appreciate our caring, they know we love them, they kind of figure we know everything--but just in case we are wrong, they would rather implement their own program for their own jurisdiction, our Democrat colleagues say: No, they don't care enough, they don't know enough, they are ignorant. 
   We do not agree. We want people in Wyoming to be able to say: Look we really appreciate the bill, we know you guys want to help us, but we don't have any HMOs; we say they ought to have the right to opt out. 
   If Tennessee says: Look, we set up TennCare because we adopted the Clinton health care bill in Tennessee--they wish they hadn't done it, but they did--if they say we would rather do it our way than your way, our Democrat colleagues say: What do you know? What do you know in Tennessee? You people in Tennessee don't know and don't care about people. We want to do it for you. We are going to tell you how to do it. 
   What we say is: Look, we have written a good bill. We want everybody to look at it very closely. In those areas where only Federal law applies, the bill applies. You can't get out from under it because there are no other protections. But if Tennessee decides in areas where they have already passed a Patients' Bill of Rights that they would rather do it their way than our way, we say if their elected Representatives, their Governor, decides to do it that way, they have the right to do it. 
   Is that an extreme view? Is that somehow denying people protection? Is freedom a denial of protection? Is keeping the right to choose denying people a basic health right? I don't think so. I think it enhances rights. And that is what this debate is about. 
   Our Democrat colleagues with all their hearts believe that the Government ought to take over the health care system and they think everything should be done in Washington. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I know we are in a hurry. We are trying to get through with this bill. I think that is important work, and I am for it. Let me make my point very succinctly. 
   This bill, in section 515, has a provision that changes current law and shifts the payment date for SSI, the Supplemental Security Income program, from October back to September. What that does is shift $2.4 billion worth of spending out of the budget year for which we are writing this appropriation back into the previous fiscal year. In the process, it allows $2.4 billion more to be spent this year by spending $2.4 billion in the previous fiscal year. This payment shift was specifically debated during the budget resolution debate. It was rejected. Part of the agreement that was made that passed the budget was that there would be no payment shift on SSI. 
   This provision is subject to a point of order because it violates the budget agreement. It shifts spending into fiscal year 2000 and drives up spending in that year $2.4 billion above the level provided for in the budget. 
   If we are going to write budgets, they have to have some meaning. This is not just some minor provision. The debate on this issue was a key element of the debate on that budget, and the Budget Committee and the Senate specifically rejected this payment shift. 
   So on the basis of that, Mr. President, I make a point of order that section 515 of the bill, as amended, violates section 311 of the Budget Act, since it would cause fiscal year 2000 budget authority and outlays to exceed the spending aggregates in the budget resolution.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I want to remind my colleagues that sustaining this point of order does not bring down the bill. Under the unanimous consent agreement the bill is being considered under, sustaining this point of order would simply strike section 515. 
   I am perfectly willing to let the Senate go on with other amendments. I am going to insist on this point of order at some point, and it will have to come to a resolution. But if we can do other business while this is being discussed, I think that is a good idea. The point of order is a very targeted point of order against section 515, not against the bill.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, before we break down in the tears and the shock that would come from not shifting spending from one year to another to break the budget by $2.4 billion, let me remind my colleagues that with this shift and with the entitlement changes that Senator STEVENS has said we are not going to make, this bill will grow by 20.5 percent over last year. You can't find that growth rate even going as far back as the Carter administration. You have to go all the way back to when L.B.J. was President to find a bill growing that fast. 
   If the point of order is sustained eliminating the phony pay shift and an adjustment is made in spending, this bill will still be growing by 17.7 percent. Granted that we each look at the world through different glasses. I don't see that as cataclysm; I see that as somewhat of a movement toward fiscal restraint. 
   But the important point is this provision violates the Budget Act. We considered this payment shift in the budget. We specifically rejected it. We set out numbers that were meant to meet the targets for spending that were agreed to. This provision violates the Budget Act, and it should be stricken. I will insist on the point of order against it, but I am perfectly willing to let amendments move forward. If the minority doesn't want amendments to be considered, it is up to them.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the comments made by our colleague from Iowa. My point of order can be called many things, but calling it mischievous--not that there is anything wrong with being mischievous in defense of the public interest--but my point of order is anything but mischievous. 
   Our colleague from Iowa would have us believe that shifting SSI payments from fiscal year 2001 to 2000 does not increase spending. Nothing could be further from the truth. Under current law, the payments for SSI will be made on October 2 and they will be part of the 2001 budget. What this illegal--under the Budget Act--payment shift does is shift this payment back into fiscal year 2000 and raids the surplus that we have all pledged to protect by a total of $2.4 billion, freeing up $2.4 billion more to be spent next year. So the first point is, sustaining this point of order will mean we will spend $2.4 billion less. 
   Second, a point of order was not raised against the D.C. appropriations bill last year on the pay shift because there was no point of order available. That pay shift did not violate the budget in effect at that time. This SSI payment shift was considered in the budget and it was rejected, specifically rejected. 
   Let me explain exactly the arithmetic of where we are. In allocating spending for this fiscal year, the Appropriations Committee allocated to Labor-HHS appropriations, a subcommittee that funds many important programs for America, a 13.5-percent increase in spending. That was far and away the largest increase in spending of any budget allocation. You would  have to go all the way back to when Jimmy Carter was President to find that level of spending. 
   The first thing this committee did was it put some entitlement reforms in the bill, which the chairman of the committee has already said are not going to be made. They are going to be taken out in conference. But by claiming that they are going to be made, they magically raised their increase in spending from 13.5 percent over last year's level to 17.7 percent over last year's level. You are now in the range where going back to when Jimmy Carter was President does not hold up. We are getting to the point where you have to go back to the time when Lyndon Johnson was President to find increases like that. 
   But even that was not enough. What they did was include a phony payment shift--by taking SSI payments, which by law are to be made on October 2, which is after the beginning of the new fiscal year, in other words, money they would have had to have funded in the 2001 budget--by taking that payment and moving it into fiscal year 2000, they can rob the surplus by $2.4 billion and spend $2.4 billion next year. By doing that, they would then raise the increase in spending over last year's level to 20.5 percent. 
   These tears that are being shed about my point of order, which simply calls on the Senate to live up to its budget, these tears are being shed because by doing that we could increase spending in this area only by 17.7 percent. By enforcing the budget, rather than increasing spending by 20.5 percent, we would increase spending by 17.7 percent. How many working families have seen their income go up by 17.7 percent in the last year? I submit, not very many families. 
   So what I have done is simply said: When we adopted a budget we meant it. When we set out what we were going to spend in this coming year, we meant for those constraints to be binding. What is literally happening in the Congress is that this surplus is burning a gigantic hole in our pocket. We are seeing spending increases at levels that have not been approached since Lyndon Johnson was President of the United States. It is very dangerous for two reasons. No. 1, if we have a downturn, those surpluses are not going to be there. Second, some of us had hoped that we would repeal the marriage penalty, so we do not have to make people in America who fall in love and get married pay $1,400 a year in 
   additional income taxes for that right. We had hoped to repeal the death tax so your family would not have to sell off your family farm or your business that your parents worked a lifetime to build up, simply because they died. But if we are going to be increasing spending like this and busting the budget, we are never going to have an opportunity to share the benefits of this prosperity with working Americans. 
   When our colleague says this point of order does not save money, that is simply not true. It saves $2.4 billion. 
   Second, I am going to raise a point of order on the supplemental appropriation for military construction. I am going to raise it because what we are doing is obscene in terms of spending, and the bill does violate the Budget Act. I intend to raise the point of order. 
   Let me finally say that this point of order is important. In fact, we have used it five times today to prevent new spending from being added. The amazing thing is that we have before us an appropriations bill that grows by one-fifth, over 20 percent, and yet we have spent all day long where the minority has been trying to add more and more and more spending. You begin to wonder when is it enough? Is there any appropriations bill that could have been written that would have been enough? 
   Yet with all this spending, we are all talking about locking away money for Social Security, locking away money for Medicare, but the spending goes on and on and on. 
   I raised the budget point of order. If Senator STEVENS comes over and reallocates money and takes it away from another use so the total level of spending does not rise, he certainly has a right to do that. That will mean this point of order will stand. This phony payment shift will be stricken. But the money will be allocated to be spent on these programs and taken away from something else. That is how the budget is supposed to work. We are supposed to make decisions like American families make decisions. If they want a new refrigerator they don't buy a new washing machine. If they want to go on vacation, they don't buy a new car. They set priorities. 
   Our problem is we never set priorities. So I think this point of order is important. This point of order is an enforcement of the budget. We ought to be holding the line on spending. I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have been meeting on a bipartisan basis to try to put together a bill in the waning hours of this Congress that will provide for prescription drug insurance for senior Americans. We have been working in good faith. 
   This is a bad faith amendment. This is a politics-first amendment. Nobody knows what it costs. Nobody knows how it will work. Nobody knows what it does to the solvency of Medicare. This is politics at its worst. 
   I think this body ought to be offended by it. I am offended by it. I do not believe that voters are going to be impressed by circumventing the process. This does not speed it up. This makes it harder for people such as Senator ROTH and Senator BREAUX to bring us together to pass a bill. This needs to be rejected by an overwhelming vote. 
   I urge those who really want a prescription drug benefit--label this for what it is by voting no, and let's get on with trying to do this on a bipartisan basis.

   Mr. GRAMM. As to its coverage, does the Senator agree that this act is intended to operate very broadly to permit the use of electronic signatures and electronic records in all business, consumer and commercial contexts? This breadth is accomplished through the use of the term ``transaction,'' which is defined broadly to include any action or set of actions relating to the conduct of business, consumer or commercial affairs between two or more persons. For example, a unilateral action or set of actions by one of the parties to the underlying transaction, or by any other person with any interest in the underlying transaction, or a response by one party to the other's action, all are covered by the act. In this regard, it is the nature of the activity, rather than the number of persons or the identity or status of the person or entity involved in the activity, that determines the applicability of the act. Have I stated the matter correctly?

   In addition, it would cover all activities relating to employee benefit plans or any other type of tax-favored plan, annuity or account such as an IRA, a 403(b) annuity, or an education savings program, including all related tax and other required filings and reports. Is this correct?

    Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Boll Weevil Eradication Equity Act. Boll weevil infestation has caused more than $15 billion worth of damage to the United States cotton crop, and the nation's cotton producers lose $300 million annually. Texas is the largest cotton producing state in the nation, yet the scope of this problem extends beyond Texas. The ability of all states to eradicate this pest would stop future migration to boll weevil-free areas and prevent reintroduction of the boll weevil into those areas which have already completed a successful eradication effort. 
   We must continue to build upon the past success of the existing program that authorizes the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture to join with individual states and provide technical assistance and federal cost-share funds. This highly successful partnership has resulted in complete boll weevil eradication in California, Florida, Arizona, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina. These states received an average federal cost-share of 26.9 percent, with producers and individual states paying the remaining cost. 
   Since 1994, however, the program has expanded into Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Oklahoma and New Mexico, but the federal appropriation has remained relatively constant. The addition of this vast acreage has resulted in dramatically reducing the federal cost share to only 4 percent, leaving producers and individual states to fund the remaining 96 percent. This is not fair to the states now participating in the program because federal matching funds to the states enrolled in the early years of the program constituted almost 30 percent of eradication costs. 
   The National Cotton Council estimates that for every $1 spent on eradication, cotton farmers will accrue about $12 in benefits. The bill I am introducing today will authorize a federal cost share contribution of not less than 26.9 percent to the states and producers which still must contend with boll weevil infestation. I urge my colleagues to join this effort to ensure that these producers receive no less support than that which was provided during the earlier stages of the program.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, under the very able leadership of Senator NICKLES we have worked on this conference report more than 400 hours with more intense effort than any conference of which I have ever been part. From time to time many of our colleagues have said to Senator NICKLES: The Democrats do not want a bill; they want a political issue. Why don't we write a bill and pass it with Republican votes? 
   Our dear colleague and leader, Senator NICKLES, has said: No, I want to try to do this on a bipartisan basis. 
   I think what Senator KENNEDY has proven today in a cynical political act is that no good deed ever goes unpunished. We are not here today because we are not making progress. We are here today because we are making too much progress. We are here today because we are on the verge of writing a bill, but it is a bill that Senator KENNEDY is not for. 
   Senator KENNEDY has said: If you will just let lawyers get into the patient treatment room and, if you will just let people file lawsuits, he will be happy. We want to put the focus on getting health care, and one gets that from doctors and not lawyers. 
   In an effort to accommodate and reach a bipartisan compromise, Senator NICKLES proposed allowing HMOs to be sued. What does Senator KENNEDY say? It is not enough. Senator KENNEDY does not just want to sue HMOs, he wants to sue employers. To that we say no, we are not going to sue employers. Health insurance is provided on a voluntary basis, and we do not want employers to drop their health insurance for their workers. We are worried about millions of Americans losing their health insurance. Senator KENNEDY is not worried about that; the Democrats are not worried about that because they have their plan. 
   And here it is. Do my colleagues remember this, the Clinton health care bill? Do my colleagues remember what they wanted to do? They wanted the Government to take over and run the health care system. Today, Senator KENNEDY is very worried about HMOs, but let me read something about how their health care purchasing collectives would work in his bill with President Clinton. 
   If a patient went to a doctor and asked for treatment for your sick child, and the doctor thought your child should have it, under the Clinton plan if the Government health board ruled no, the doctor could be fined $50,000 for providing that health care to your sick child. 
   If you said: My baby is sick, I want the health care but the Government will not pay for it, their health care bill said if the doctor provided it and  you paid him, he went to prison for 15 years. That is their idea of HMOs they like, one HMO run by the Government. 
   That is not our idea. We reject it, and we will fight it until it is dead. They will never give up on it. They do not care if they destroy the health care system of this country. They do not care if millions of people are uninsured because they know how to insure them: Insure them by having the Government take over the health care system. We say no. 
   In our bill, we expand coverage. We gave tax deductibility to the self-employed. We want to give tax deductibility for buying health insurance if a company does not provide it. Why should General Motors get a tax deduction for buying health care but your family does not? We try to encourage people to buy long-term care insurance, so we make it tax deductible. 
   We want to give people choices, so we have medical savings accounts. Yet in this legislation before us, there is not one mention of tax deductibility for health insurance, not one mention of expanding coverage, not one mention of expanding freedom by letting people use tax-free money to buy health insurance. Why not? What does Senator KENNEDY have against the self-employed getting the same treatment as General Motors, or people who do not work for an employer that can provide health insurance getting a tax deduction? We know why he has against it. He does not want people to spend their money on health care. He wants the Government to spend the money for them. That is what this issue is about. 
   As much as we have tried to write a bipartisan bill, unfortunately, this is an election year. We are proving it right here on the floor of the Senate. We are going to reject this amendment, and I hope we will come to our senses. I hope that we will go back into conference and write a bill and bring it to the floor, a bill that does not allow employers to be sued, a bill that holds HMOs accountable, a bill that lets people buy health insurance with tax-free dollars, and then let Senator KENNEDY vote no. 
   But I believe that America will vote yes. And this is about choices. 
   Senator KENNEDY protests that we are not making progress. We are not making progress in the wrong direction. That is what Senator KENNEDY is unhappy about. We are not going to sue employers. We are going to provide tax relief to people to buy health care. We are going to hold HMOs accountable. We are not going to let the Government take over and run health care. 
   As for the principle of compromise, I am willing to compromise and go part way, as long as we are going in the right direction. But I do not have any interest in compromising, in going part way in the wrong direction because that means we have further to go in going in the right direction. 
   I congratulate the chairman of this conference. He has done a great job. He has provided the best leadership on any conference that I have seen since I have been in Congress. He deserves better treatment. I believe Republicans ought to be outraged about this. And I am outraged. I have worked hard on this conference. 
   We are going to produce a good product. I am happy to have people judge me at the polls on it. I believe when you ask people do they want employers to be sued, I think they are going to say no. Senator KENNEDY wants them to be sued. I say no. Let the American people decide in November. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this has been a long debate and, I think, a good debate. It has proven once again that this is an election year. I am not going to insult everybody's intelligence by telling them that I am shocked that Senator KENNEDY is engaged in partisan politics this afternoon. This is an election year. We are politicians. This is a political act to basically try to win, again, what Senator KENNEDY lost when we had the debate on the floor of the Senate. 
   Senator NICKLES won. We are in conference trying to work out an agreement, and Senator KENNEDY doesn't like the way the agreement is going; he is unhappy about it. But rather than get into all this ``who shot John,'' I have tried to come up with a simple example for somebody back home who is trying to figure out what this is all about, and let me try to give it to you as succinctly as I can. 
   Somebody goes into the treatment room and the doctor comes in there and they have their stethoscope and they tell him to take off his shirt. In comes somebody else. They say: Well, who is that in this room? And that is the gatekeeper for the HMO. Now, what the patient wants is to get that gatekeeper out of the examining room so it is them and their doctor. Senator KENNEDY says he has the answer. His answer is: Well, keep the gatekeeper but here is how we will fix it. We will bring in a lawyer to sue the HMO, the insurance company, and the employer that bought the insurance. So we have the lawyer there and he gets part of the stethoscope. And then we bring in a bureaucrat to regulate it. So Senator KENNEDY's answer is, rather than getting the HMO out of the examining room, bring in a lawyer and a bureaucrat; and here is the poor patient with his heart at the end of the stethoscope and now four people are listening to the heart. 
   Now, what we are trying to do here is simple. We are trying to empower the American health care consumer to fire the HMO. We give them the ability to have innovative ways of financing health care, such as medical savings accounts, so if they don't like the way the HMO is treating them, they don't go see a lawyer, or a bureaucrat, or they don't see Senator KENNEDY; they simply call up their HMO and say: You are fired. They go out through a medical savings account, and they have their credit card or their checking account through their medical savings account, and they pick up the phone and they don't say: Are you a member of our HMO? My baby is sick and needs care. Will you see him? They simply say: Will you take a check? 
   ``Do you take MasterCard or Visa?'' If they do, they are in. 
   In reality, that is what this debate is about. Do you believe in bureaucrats, or do you believe in freedom? 
   Senator KENNEDY, in all his heart, believes--and he is sincere, and I admire him for it--that having a lawyer there and having a bureaucrat in there improves the system. 
   He supported a health care bill where if a doctor provided you health care that an advisory panel appointed by the Government didn't support, they could be fined $50,000. He supported the Clinton bill where if your baby is sick and the Government said this child doesn't need treatment, and you said to the doctor, treat my child and I will pay for it, if the doctor took the money he could be sent to prison for 15 years. 
   That is what their alternative was. 
   What we want to do is give people freedom. One of the freedoms under our bill is to say to your HMO: You are fired. 
   If you think having a lawyer and a bureaucrat is good, then you are for Senator KENNEDY. But if you believe in freedom and what is right for you and your family, what we are trying to do is the right way to go.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in 1992 and 1993, when Senator KENNEDY and the Democrats were trying to raise taxes, which, unfortunately, they succeeded in doing, and when they were trying to have the Government take over the health care system, which, thank God, they failed to do, I said people would lose their jobs if they were successful. And they did. Democrats lost their jobs. Not one Republican was defeated as an incumbent in 1994. We won nine seats in the Senate. And we are in the majority. 
   Some people did lose their jobs, because Americans did not want the Government to take over and run the health care system. I say to Senator KENNEDY that, as sad as I know it makes him, they still don't, and they never will.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I join with Senator LUGAR, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, to introduce the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. The formal purpose of this legislation is to reauthorize the Commodity Exchange Act, the legal authority for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As important as that is, this legislation does far more. 
   This is a landmark bill, that addresses four chief goals that Senator LUGAR and I set out to achieve when we first began discussing this legislation. First of all, this bill would repeal the so-called Shad-Johnson Accord, the 18-year-old temporary prohibition on the trading of futures based on individual stocks. Second, the bill eliminates the legal uncertainly that today hangs as an ominous cloud over the $7 trillion financial swaps markets. Third, the bill addresses the need to harmonize the treatment of margins among the futures, stock, and options markets. Fourth, the bill provides important and necessary regulatory relief to the futures and securities markets. 
   One of the most notable aspects of this bill is that it brings together the chairmen of the two committees with jurisdiction over these issues, the Agriculture Committee and the Banking Committee. To start out with such cooperation speaks well, I believe, for the prospects for this legislation. While the Commodity Exchange Act is clearly within the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee, stocks, options, and swaps are within the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. 
   The next step for this bill will be joint hearings of our two committees to consider it. Few bills are in a perfected form when first introduced, and I fully expect that additional changes will be made to this one before it becomes law. For example, I hope to see additional measures of regulatory relief for the securities markets included. 
   But this bill is a fine beginning, introduced in the best way. We bring together two committees that could choose to argue over turf but instead are choosing to cooperate to make changes in law that are needed to ensure that our financial market places continue to lead the world. At the same time, we will be providing the widest choice of investment opportunities for American businesses and families.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me remind everyone that 4 years ago we moved to begin to correct an injustice in military medicine, and the injustice was that if you served in the military for 20 or more years, you received a commitment, at least in your mind and I believe in reality, that you and your dependents would have access to military medicine for the rest of your life. When Medicare came in and the federal government started making the military pay Medicare payroll taxes, it stopped allowing retirees over 64 to use military medicine. That was a breach of faith. Then we started an experiment 4 years ago to allow them to use their Medicare coverage to obtain treatment at base hospitals again. The Warner amendment we just adopted will allow people who served a career in the military to get treatment at base hospitals from military doctors, and have Medicare pay the cost. It is a good idea and I strongly support it. 
   Now, Senator JOHNSON has offered an amendment that on its face has merit, and that is to put military retirees into FEHBP. Maybe in the long run that is the answer to the problem. But the problem with Senator JOHNSON's amendment today is that it busts the budget by $92 billion. So I urge my colleagues, whether they support the FEHBP solution or not, to not bust the budget today. Let's stand with the taxpayers today, and let's also complete the Medicare subvention experiment, and let's take up Senator JOHNSON's proposal when we know how to pay for it. I thank the chair.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first, I thank our wonderful colleague from California for doing such a sweet thing. She is going to speak for some time. I know it would help educate me to stay and hear it, but like so many other people, I am too busy and I want to say a few things. 
   First of all, I congratulate the President for proposing the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. The President recognized wisely that even if we took all the aid provided by every country in the world and gave it to sub-Saharan Africa, obviously we could have a short-term impact on them, but the long-term impact would be small when compared to the impact we can have through trade. 
   This bill is an opportunity for us to open up our markets for goods from some of the poorest countries in the world. I know there are some who say that even though this will mean clothing will be cheaper for American consumers, for working and low-income Americans, somehow there is a sacrifice involved. I fail to see it. I see everybody benefiting from trade. Desperately poor people in Africa will have an opportunity to produce products that can be sold in America, and we can raise their living standards and our own through the miracle of world trade. 
   This is not a perfect bill. I wish it were less protectionist. One provision in the bill requires that in order for textiles from sub-Saharan Africa to come into the country, they have to be made out of American yarn and American thread. That provision is going to reduce their competitiveness, but I appreciate the fact that the conference put in an exception for the 41 countries that have per capita incomes of below $1,500 a year. 
   So the bill is not perfect, but it is a movement in the right direction, and I strongly support it. 
   It is important for us to promote world trade. I know our colleague who spoke before me believes that trade only helps rich people and big companies, but I believe trade helps working people. It creates jobs. It creates opportunity. It expands freedom. That is  why I am so strongly in support of this bill. 
   I thank the Finance Committee for working out a compromise that will mean more trade, that will mean more products. I have to say I do not understand how, with a straight face, the textile industry was so adamantly opposed to this bill. If we unleashed all of the energies of sub-Saharan Africa and all of their productive capacity and had them produce textiles to sell in America, they would still have no substantial impact on our market. 
   I do not understand why we continue to let special interests in America direct our Government to limit our ability to buy goods that would raise the living standards of working Americans. It is outrageous and unfair, and it is important that we stand up against these protectionist forces. Who gives the American textile industry the right to say that, as a free person, I cannot buy a better shirt or a cheaper shirt produced somewhere else in the world? How is America diminished by it? I say it is not. My freedom is diminished by such forces. 
   We have a mixture of protectionism and trade in this bill. But, overall, it is a movement in the right direction, and I am in favor of it. When the Multifiber Agreement is implemented, we will open up trade in textiles. As late as 5 years ago, the average American family paid $700 more a year for clothing because of textile protection in America than they would with free trade. This is a small step in the right direction. I rejoice in it, and I support it. 
   I thank the Senator from California for yielding.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, yesterday, as I listened to our Democrat colleagues talking about the marriage penalty elimination, and their opposition to our bill, I got interested in this debate and eager to speak on it. 
   I know we have not been able to work out an agreement yet to bring the bill to the floor. I know our Democrat colleagues have refused to agree to limiting it to amendments relevant to the marriage penalty. We all know the easiest way to kill something around here is to pile a bunch of extraneous amendments on it. 
   I am hopeful we can work out these differences and that we can have a vote on eliminating the marriage penalty. The American people have a right to know where Members of the Senate stand on this critically important issue. 
   The repeal of the marriage penalty was adopted in the House by an overwhelming vote. I believe it should be repealed. I am hopeful the President will sign the bill, even though to this point in time he says he will not. But rather than waiting around for some agreement to be made--that may never be made--I felt I had something to say that ought to be heard on this issue. 
   What I would like to talk about today is, first, to set this debate within the context of the President's budget and basically highlight the choice we are making between spending here in Washington, where we sit around these conference tables and make decisions to spend billions of dollars, and spending back home in the family, where the families sit around the kitchen table and try to decide how to spend hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars for themselves. 
   I would like to talk about our repeal of the marriage penalty and why it is the right thing to do, why it is not just a tax issue, why it is a moral issue. This is a moral issue we are talking about. 
   I want to talk about the so-called marriage bonus that some of our colleagues have thrown up. I want to try to point out how it is one of the more phony issues that has ever been discussed. 
   I want to talk about President Clinton's alternative to our repeal of the marriage penalty. 
   Finally, I want to talk about the last form of bigotry that is still acceptable in America; that is, bigotry against the successful. 
   I would like to try to do all that in such a way as to deviate from my background as a schoolteacher and be brief. 
   First of all, let's outline the choices we have. The President has proposed in his budget that we spend $388 billion over the next 5 years on new Government programs and expansions of 
   programs. 
   This is brand new spending. This is $388 billion the President's budget says we ought to spend above the level we are currently spending, and we ought to do it on a series of new programs and program expansions--about 80 new programs and program expansions. 
   We have proposed that we give the people of America $150 billion of the taxes they have paid above the level we need to fund the Federal Government, and at the same time to save every penny of money that came from Social Security taxes for Social Security. 
   Many people who have followed this debate heard our Democrat colleagues spend all of yesterday saying, it is dangerous, it is irresponsible, it is reckless to let the American people keep $150 billion of this non-Social Security surplus we have in the budget because the American economy is generating more revenues than we need to pay for the current Government. 
   The question I would ask, and that I would ask Americans as they are sitting in front of their television screens or as they are sitting around the kitchen table doing their budget, is: How come it is irresponsible for us to let working families spend $150 billion more of their own money, but it is not irresponsible to let President Clinton and Vice President Gore and the Democrats spend $388 billion of their money? How come it is irresponsible when families get a chance to keep more of what they earn, and yet it is not irresponsible to take more than twice that amount of money and spend it in Washington, DC? 
   Why repeal the marriage penalty? Gosh, most people are shocked when they discover that we have such a thing. Let me quickly point out, I do not think anybody ever set out with a goal of imposing a penalty on marriage. 
   When many of the provisions of the Tax Code were adopted, only 30 percent of adult women worked outside the home; now it is roughly 60 percent. The world has changed dramatically since much of the Tax Code was written. 
   As Abraham Lincoln recognized long ago: To expect people to live under old and outmoded laws is like expecting a man to be able to wear the same clothes he wore as a boy. It just does not work. 
   No matter who set out to do it, we have in today's Tax Code a provision of law that basically produces a situation where, if two people, both of whom work outside the home, meet and fall in love and get married, they end up paying on average about $1,400 a year in additional income taxes. Paradoxically, that is true if they meet, fall in love, and decide to get married on the last day of December. They pay $1,400 more of income taxes for the right to live in holy matrimony for one day. The number gets much bigger for working couples who make substantial income, and it gets bigger for working couples who make very moderate income. 
   Today, if a janitor and a waitress--the janitor has three children; the waitress has four children; they are both working; they are struggling, trying to do the toughest job in the world, which is to make a single-parent home functional--meet and fall in love and have the opportunity to solve one of their great problems, by their getting married, they not only both lose their earned-income tax credit but they end up in the 28-percent tax bracket. We literally have a disincentive in the Tax Code for people to form the most powerful institution for human happiness and progress in history; that is, the family. 
   This obviously makes no sense. Nobody argues that it makes sense. Even the people who oppose repealing it agree that the Tax Code does not make any sense. They simply want to spend the money that would be given back, and so they don't want to give it back. They don't say it makes sense. They don't say it is fair. 
   I think it is not only unfair, it is immoral. How dare we have a Tax Code that penalizes people for getting married? So we want to repeal it. 
   Where does the penalty come from? I know people's eyes glaze over when we talk about numbers. I will not talk about many of them today, but let me try to explain why it happens. 
   If you are single and filing your tax return, you pay at the 15-percent rate on income up until you earn $25,750. Let's say you and your sweetheart both get out of school and begin teaching, and you both make $25,000 a year, and you are both paying 15-percent marginal tax rates. If you get married, then, at a combined income of $43,000, roughly, you go into the 28-percent tax bracket. 
   So the first reason for the marriage penalty is that in the case of these two young people who fell in love, got married, were making $25,000 each, they were paying 15-percent marginal tax rates each, and they got married, $7,000 of their joint income is taxed at 28 percent. 
   Secondly, the standard deduction is such that you end up losing and getting  a smaller standard deduction by getting married than if you stayed single. 
   The net result is, the standard deduction for a married couple is less than the sum of the two deductions for two individuals who are single. You get into the 15-percent tax bracket at a lower income. You get into the 28-percent tax bracket at a lower income. 
   The bottom line is, when you take into account that rather than getting $8,600 in a combined standard deduction, you only get $7,200, and when you take into account that you get into the 28-percent tax bracket $7,000 sooner, the net result is, on average, for those Americans who fall in love and get married, they pay on average $1,400 a year for the privilege of being married. 
   We get rid of the marriage penalty for everyone. How do we do it? First of all, we say, whether you are single or whether you are married, you get the same standard deduction. If it is you and your wife filing a joint return, you get twice what you would have gotten filing individually, or you get the combination of what she would have gotten and what you would have gotten. We then stretch the 15-percent tax bracket to assure that by getting married, married couples do not get pushed into a higher tax bracket. Then we stretch the 28-percent tax bracket to be sure that by getting married, people don't get pushed into the 31-percent tax bracket. 
   The net result of our bill is, we totally repeal the marriage 
   penalty. As a result, the average taxpaying family in America would get about $1,400 more that they could spend themselves on their own families. 
   I know every time we talk about appropriations here, spending money in Washington, people talk about compassion: We are spending money on education, housing, nutrition, those things we are all for. By repealing the marriage penalty and letting families keep $1,400 of their own money to spend on their own children, they are going to spend it on education, housing, and nutrition--the education they choose, the housing they choose, and the nutrition they choose. That is what we want to do. 
   The alternative is proposed by President Clinton. I want people to know that when the President stands up and says, I am for repealing the marriage penalty just as the Republicans are, only I want to do it differently, he is not quite leveling with you. You need to know that. 
   How can I possibly say such a thing? First of all, when you look at the fine print of the President's tax cut, the first year, he raises taxes by $10 billion; the second year, he raises taxes by $1 billion. At the end of 5 years, which will be in the second term of the next President--or it could be two Presidents from now--finally, the Clinton plan will grant a grand total of a $5 billion tax cut. When the President is saying he gets rid of the marriage penalty, he is not leveling with you. 
   Let us talk about who is excluded. I am sure people know the code. If they don't know the code, I want them to know it. Whenever President Clinton and Vice President GORE and the Democrats want to deny people the ability to keep money they earn, or whenever they want to raise their taxes, there is one label they always stick on them--they are ``rich.'' Every time taxes are raised, if you listen to President Clinton and Vice President GORE, we raised taxes on ``the rich.'' 
   Go back and look at the President's tax increase he proposed in 1993. It turned out that if you were earning $25,000 a year and were drawing Social Security, you were rich. That is how they define rich. Then they had tax increases on families making $44,000 a year. Ask yourself, how did they get rich? 
   Well, when you looked at the way President Clinton and Vice President GORE proposed their tax increase, to calculate who had to pay it, they added what you would have to pay in rent to rent your home if you owned your home, they calculated what your retirement had grown by, they calculated the value of your health insurance, they calculated the value of your parking place. Some family in Texas making $44,000 a year, thinking they were a long way from being rich, suddenly, with all of President Clinton's amazing ability to twist the facts, they were making $75,000 a year, if they owned their own home, owned their own car, had a parking place at work, if they owned life insurance. 
   But the point was that supposedly they were rich. Now, I am sure if you followed this debate, you have heard our Democrat colleagues say that the Republican bill gives relief from the marriage penalty to people who are rich. Well, who are they talking about? 
   Well, under the President's bill, he raises the standard deduction, though not enough to eliminate the marriage penalty coming from it, and he does nothing to eliminate the fact that young people, or people who are married, get into the 28-percent tax bracket $7,000 earlier. So when we stretch the 15-percent tax bracket, who are we helping that the President says is rich? It seems to me that is a reasonable question. Who are these rich people we are helping that the President's bill would not give the tax relief to by stretching the 15-percent tax bracket? 
   Well, the people we are helping, as it turns out, are people who make $21,525 each. So that if you have a fireman and you have a dental technician and they meet and fall in love, under the President's notion of rich, you are rich. And to quote one of our Democrat colleagues: ``You don't deserve to have this penalty eliminated because you don't need it; you are rich.'' Under their bill, two people who get married and who each make $21,525 would be denied the relief we grant by stretching the 15-percent tax bracket. 
   Now, ultimately, I ask people, if you are making $21,525, are you rich? You may not think you are, but realize that when President Clinton and Vice President GORE and the Democrats are talking about rich people, they are not talking about Rockefeller, they are not talking about Mellon, and they are not talking about all of these new rich people who came from the information age; they are talking about you if you make over $21,525. 
   Under the President's proposal, he gives no marriage penalty relief if one parent stays at home. So under the President's plan, if you sacrifice and give up things in order that one parent can stay at home, you are rich. Under the President's proposal, you don't deserve any relief under eliminating the marriage penalty. Let me quickly add, I don't want to get into a judgment--and I am not going to--on whether one parent should stay at home. My mama worked my whole life because she had to. My wife has worked the whole lives of our children because she had a career and she wanted to. I think people have to make the decision for themselves. This is the point. You are not rich because you make a decision that one of you should stay home and take care of your children. 
   The President says that if you itemize your deductions--and about half of all families who make $30,000 or more itemize deductions, and everybody does that owns a home--you are rich and therefore you don't get marriage penalty relief. The President's plan would grant marriage penalty relief at a maximum of $43.50 the first year. 
   This is my point. Does anybody really believe that somebody making $21,525 is rich? Does anybody believe that every family in America where one of the parents stays at home with their children is rich? Does anybody believe that every family who owns a home is rich? Does anybody believe that anybody who makes $30,000 a year and itemizes on their taxes is rich? I submit that nobody believes that. But why does the President say it? Why does the Vice President say it? Why do our Democrat colleagues say it? 
   Let me tell you the only thing I can figure out. The alternative to saying that you are against repealing the marriage penalty, because it goes to the rich, is to say you are against it because you want to spend it in Washington. I think what the President, the Vice President, and their supporters have concluded is that it is not viable to stand up on the floor of the Senate, or in front of a television camera anywhere, and say it probably is unfair that you are paying $1,400 for the right to be married; but, look, we can spend the money in Washington better than you can, and it is better to let us keep it because we will spend it and we will make you better off. I don't think anybody would believe that and 
   so, as a result, we see an effort to confuse people by saying, well, look, we just don't want to give this to the rich. But who gets tax relief to eliminate the marriage penalty under our bill and ends  up not getting the full relief under the President's bill? People making $21,525 each, people who choose to have one parent stay at home, people who own their home or itemize deductions. 
   So the plain truth is, those are the people who are being called rich. I don't think that is an accurate portrayal of rich. But, look, what is wrong with being rich? I will address that in a moment. You have heard, and you will hear again as this debate progresses, about a marriage bonus. Let me not mince words. If there has ever been a fraudulent idea in any debate in American history, it is the marriage bonus. Clearly, some minion at IRS was ordered by a politician to give a justification for continuing the marriage penalty, and after great exertion and twisting of logic, they came up with the concept of a marriage bonus--that there are actually people getting a bonus from being married--an average of about $1,300, I think it is, for these people who supposedly get the bonus. 
   What is this bonus? The bonus is the following thing. I have two sons; one is 24 and one is 26. They have been on my payroll for those corresponding numbers of years. I, as many parents, look forward to them being off my payroll. If a wonderful, successful girl came along and married one of them, she would get a marriage bonus. She would get to take a standard deduction by having them on her payroll instead of my payroll. She would be able to file jointly with them and stay in the 15-percent tax bracket, up to $43,000 a year. She would end up getting, on average, about an $1,300 benefit by marrying one of my sons. I would lose the benefit, but would I complain? Would this be a great economic deal for her? I mean, let's get serious. Can you feed, clothe, house, educate, and entertain somebody for $1,300 a year, or $1,400 a year, or $4,000 a year? 
   We insult the intelligence of the American people by talking about a marriage bonus as if the piddling amount of deduction that people get when they marry someone who doesn't work outside the home as if somehow that is a bonus to them, when it is a tiny fraction of what it costs, basically, to care for someone in America. 
   Let me say I would be willing to supplement the marriage bonus that someone would get by taking one of my sons off my payroll. Maybe for love someday it will happen. I hope so. But for economic reasons, nobody is going to marry somebody to get their standard deduction because they cannot feed them, house them, clothe them, and all the other things they need for them. 
   Let's not insult the intelligence of the American people by sighing: Oh, yes, it is true that the average family with two members who work outside the home pay $1,400 of additional taxes for the right to be married, but there are these people who get a bonus. The bonus is a fraud. The tax penalty is very real. 
   I want to turn to the final question. It is one about which I have thought a lot and about which I feel very strongly. That is all this business about, every time we debate anything related to the Tax Code, we are always talking about rich people. 
   For some reason, the President and the Vice President and many members of their party believe you have to constantly divide Americans based on their income. I strongly object to it because I think it is very destructive of everything this country stands for. 
   There are a lot of things I have always admired about my mama. But the one thing I think I admire the most is, when I was a boy and we were riding around in a car, we would ride down the nicest street in town, and my mama would almost always say, ``If you work hard and you make good grades, someday you can live in a house like that.'' 
   By the logic of the President and the Vice President and many members of their party, my mother should have been saying: Those are rich people. They probably stole this money from us. It is outrageous that they have this money. They don't deserve this money. We ought to take some of this money away from them. 
   If we had some landed aristocracy, or something, maybe you could make that argument. But the people who were living in those nice houses when I was growing up as a boy didn't get there by accident. Most of the people didn't inherit that money, most of them earned it. Why should they be singled out? 
   Under their logic, my wife's father would have been a rich person to be singled out. Both his parents were immigrants. Neither of them had any formal education. He won $25 for an essay contest when he was a senior on ``What I can do to make America a greater country.'' His essay was, the only part of America he could control was himself; the only way he could make it a greater country was making something out of himself. 
   He won $25 in 1932 for writing that essay. And he decided he was coming to the mainland from Hawaii and was going to become an engineer. 
   He took a freighter from Hawaii, got on a train, met a boy going to an engineering school, went there, went out looking for a job, went to a restaurant, and the guy at the restaurant said: You are in luck. There is a guy coming here with a machine that says it will wash dishes. If you can outwash the machine, you have the job. Joe Lee outwashed the machine. 
   He went on, and 3 years later he had a degree in electrical engineering. 
   He became the first Asian American ever to be an officer of a sugar company in the history of Hawaii. 
   Is he the kind of person we ought to hold up and say, He is rich? 
   He was president of the Rotary Club. He was president of the Little League. He was the head lay leader of his church. 
   Is that something in America where we single people out and say they are rich? I don't think so. 
   There is only one form of bigotry that is still acceptable in America, and that is bigotry against the successful. It is bigotry against the people who, through their own exertions, succeed. 
   I would just like to say, obviously, it is a free country. If the President and the Vice President and people in their party who constantly engage in this class warfare want to do it, they have a right to do it. But I don't think it is right. And I think they are stretching the truth to the breaking point when they claim that in repealing the marriage penalty, as we do that, we are helping rich people when in fact the President's proposal to ``eliminate the marriage penalty'' denies marriage penalty relief to people who earn $21,525 a year. 
   Where I am from, that is not rich. But there is nothing wrong with being rich. 
   Look, if we are against the marriage penalty, aren't we against it if a young lawyer and a young accountant meet and fall in love? Why should it exist for some people and not for others? Should marriage penalties be paid by people who have high incomes and not by those with low income? 
   Our position is very simple. The marriage penalty is wrong. It is immoral. It should be repealed, and we are going to repeal it. 
   I hope the President will sign this bill. If he doesn't, we are going to have an election. If people want it repealed, they will know how to vote. 
   I thank my colleagues for their indulgence, having listened to speeches all yesterday about the rich and how we were trying to help them by repealing the marriage penalty. Let me simply say I thought some response was needed. Let me also say I don't have any objection to people being rich. I wish we had more rich people. When our programs are in effect, we will have more rich people because they will have more opportunity. They won't be paying the death tax, and they won't be paying the marriage penalty. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. I commend our colleague from Louisiana. Today we have 130 million people who work outside the home and earn income. We have some 260 million Americans. About 30 million of them get some form of public assistance. You might ask yourself: Who takes care of the other 100 million Americans? They are taken care of by families. And the driving force is love. 
   So not only is the distinguished Senator from Louisiana talking about saving money, but what adoptive parents will add to the equation is love and care. The whole world benefits from it. So I commend her.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank Senator DURBIN for offering his version of the tax cut proposed by Governor Bush. I believe he will get an opportunity next year to vote on it. I look forward to having that opportunity. I intend to vote for it when it is offered by then-President George Bush. I hope and believe it will pass the Senate by an overwhelming margin. 
   But let me try, if I might, to explain the dilemma we have in terms of trying to do the Bush tax cut now, as if this were a serious proposal. Then I want to discuss my substitute. 
   Quite aside from the fact the years do not actually match up because if George Bush is elected President, he will take the oath on January 20 of next year, and therefore his tax cut would begin in fiscal year 2002 in all probability, but let me explain the problem. I am grateful for the opportunity because it tells a story that miraculously the general public does not appear to understand; that is, why can't we have Clinton's budget and George Bush's tax cut? 
   The reason we cannot--it is an old fact of life--you can't have your cake and eat it too. President Clinton has proposed a budget that, in the 5 years from 2002 through 2006, would spend, relative to what we are spending now, an additional $494 billion. For the years that this tax cut amendment would be in force, the President's budget that was submitted this year, if enacted, would raise spending by $494 billion. 
   During that same period, the Bush tax cut, if adopted, would reduce taxes by $483 billion. That gives rise to two points. First of all, we cannot increase spending on some 80 new programs and program expansions which President Clinton has proposed, increasing spending by half a trillion dollars in 5 years--we cannot have the Government spend all that money and at the same time give it back to working families so they can spend it. We cannot do both. We are going to have to choose. 
   The question we are all going to have to answer--and by ``all'' I do not mean just 100 Members of the Senate; I mean every voter in America--the question we are going to have to answer is: Do we want these 80 new programs and program expansions so we can spend in Washington another $500 billion over the first 5 years of the new Presidency, or would we rather eliminate the marriage penalty? 
   Today, Americans meet, fall in love and get married and they discover they end up paying about $1,200 of additional taxes for the right to be married. Let me make it clear. My wife is worth $1,200--a bargain at the price. But it seems to me she ought to get the money and not the Federal Government. 
   How can it make sense in America, if you have a janitor with three children and a waitress with two children, they meet, their dreams come true, they fall in love--under the American Tax Code they both lose their earned-income tax credit and they are suddenly in the 28-percent tax bracket? So they look at the dollars and cents and many of them decide not to get married.  
   How does it make sense? If two people get out of college, meet, and fall in love and get married, forming the most powerful bond for human happiness and progress in world history, why is that a taxable event? Why is love and marriage taxed by the Federal Government? 
   Governor Bush says it should not be taxed. If he is elected President, he wants to repeal the marriage penalty so love and marriage are not taxable events. 
   If you agree with Senator DURBIN, and if you agree with the Vice President, AL GORE, then you believe you can spend that 
   money in Washington better than all of those married couples could spend it, and you do not want to eliminate the marriage penalty. You want all these new government programs. 
   Rather than starting a new spending spree, spending $494 billion on some 80 new and expanded programs, Governor Bush has proposed that he would rather eliminate the death tax. 
   What does the death tax do? Death is a taxable event under the American Tax Code. Americans work their whole lives, they build up a small business, they build up a family farm, they pay taxes on every dollar they earn in their lives. Yet when they die and leave their life's work to their children, the people they built the life's work for, too often in America those children have to sell the farm or sell the business to give Government up to 55 cents out of every dollar of their life's work. They paid taxes on every dollar they earned, but because they accumulated, because they saved, because they sacrificed, their children end up having to sell the business and sell the family farm in order to give another tax to Government. 
   Senator DURBIN and Vice President GORE say: Don't do that. Don't repeal the marriage penalty. Don't repeal the death tax. Let us spend this money for you in Washington. 
   You think that by keeping the farm your daddy and mama worked a lifetime for that you would be better off, but they say: You would not. Let us take your farm because we are going to give you all these Government programs. 
   They say: Look, you think you know how to spend an extra $1,200 on your children, but you are wrong. AL GORE and Senator DURBIN know better how to spend that money than you do. 
   This amendment is really about choice. President Clinton gives us one choice, and George Bush gives us another. 
   President Clinton's choice is, between 2004 and 2006, some 80 new and expanded programs will get $494 billion. That is what he wants to do. He can spend this money and make everything wonderful for you and your family, and if you believe that, you ought to elect AL GORE as President because that is his program. In fact, he wants to spend far more than President Clinton does. 
   Governor Bush believes you can spend that money better than the Government. So rather than giving the Government another $494 billion to spend--we are not talking about Social Security; we are not talking about Medicare; we are talking about spending basically on discretionary programs. 
   The President's discretionary nondefense budget goes up by a whopping 14 percent when one makes the adjustments for all the phony revenues and shifting when somebody is paying and when they are not paying. 
   If you believe President Clinton and Vice President GORE are right, that we would be better off spending the $494 billion in Washington on your behalf to help you and your family, then you ought to be for spending this money. But if you believe repealing the marriage penalty and repealing the death tax so your family can keep more money to spend on their children so you don't have to sell your farm or sell your business--and 73 percent of small businesses do not make it into the second generation, in part because of death taxes. If you believe you would be better off spending $483 billion, along with every other family in America, than having Washington spend $494 billion for you, then you are going to get to vote on it. This 
   is going to be on the ballot in November, but it is going to have AL GORE's name next to the spending and it is going to have George Bush's name next to the tax reductions. 
   How people are being confused is that many of our colleagues and the Vice President and President say George Bush wants to give $483 billion in tax cuts, he wants to stop penalizing couples for getting married, he wants to stop taking farms away from people when they die, and he wants to reduce tax rates across the board, and that is dangerous. 
   I say to Senator DOMENICI, they say it is dangerous to give back $483 billion in tax refunds to working people, but they do not say it is dangerous to spend $494 billion. I ask the question: If it is dangerous to give it back to the American people and let them spend it, how come it is not dangerous to spend it right here in Washington, DC? How can it be irresponsible for Governor Bush to be talking about $483 billion in tax reductions, letting working people keep more of what they earn, and how come it is not irresponsible for President Clinton to be talking about spending $494 billion more in Washington?

   Mr. GRAMM. It would take 3 years to consume the entire surplus. Why is it less dangerous to let them spend the whole thing in 3 years than giving a tax cut and giving most of that surplus back? The reason this amendment is so important is that I do not think we are ready to debate the Presidential campaign on the floor of the Senate. 
   The point is, our colleague from Illinois has offered an amendment that he claims will have us voting on the Bush tax cut. Here is the dilemma: We cannot have Clinton spending and the Bush tax cut. We have to choose between the two. That is what the election is about. If you want this spending, you ought to vote for AL GORE, and if you would rather repeal the marriage penalty so we do not charge young couples $1,200 a year for the right to be married, if you think we ought to repeal the death tax so that you do not have to sell your daddy's and mama's farm when they die on which they spent a lifetime and paid taxes on every dollar they earned, plowed money back into that farm, skimped for it, sacrificed for it--or if you are a small business--if you think you should not have to sell it just because they die, then you ought to vote for Governor Bush. 
   We cannot adopt the Bush tax cut now because we have the Clinton budget before us. We are going to get an opportunity next year to have a Bush budget and the Bush tax cut. At that time, I hope we will get votes from some of our Democrats. I predict today that we will get at least 15 of them who will vote 
   for it.

   Mr. GRAMM. The Senator will get his 30 minutes. I have my 30 minutes, with all due respect. 
   What I have done is offer an amendment that says it is the sense of the Senate we should not to be doing this; we should not be raising gasoline taxes so the Vice President can get rid of our cars and our trucks. 
   Since the Senator from Illinois decided today we ought to vote on the two alternatives, his argument is that it is OK for President Clinton in his budget to spend a new $494 billion in taxes but it is not all right, it is risky, I say to Senator DOMENICI, it is terribly risky if, instead of us spending it, we let the taxpayers spend it. I do not get it. I do not understand how it is not risky for us to spend it but somehow it is risky to repeal the marriage penalty or the death tax. 
   So what I have offered, since we cannot do the Bush tax cut until George Bush becomes President--and I would like to hurry the day; if we could do something today that could make it come sooner, God knows, I would sign on as a cosponsor. But I do not think we are going to be able to do it before the Constitution says we can. In any case, what I have done, since we have started this debate, is I have taken the Vice President's book, and I have put in the first installments of what would be required to get rid of all the internal combustion engines, and the first installment would be a $1.50 tax on gasoline today, then another $1.50 tax 4 years from now. That would only start it. We would have to go up from there. But I want to take a conservative approach, as I always do. 
   Finally, for those who say, OK, the Vice President wrote this book, but he did not mean it. This book was written for environmentalists. He meant it for them, but he did not mean it for people in Texas or New Mexico--let me read his response when he was asked about it. 
   He said, ``There is not a statement in that book that I don't endorse, not one.'' 
   I do not endorse them. I am against raising gasoline taxes. I am against taking away my pickup truck. I am opposed to it. 
   I thought this was going to be saved for us to vote on in the election. But since our colleague from Illinois decided to debate the Presidential campaign today, let's debate it. 
   Let me conclude with this remark, and then I will reserve the remainder of my time and let our colleague speak. 
   I am happy to say the man I support for President wants to cut your taxes. I am proud of it. I want the world to know it. I suspect our colleague from Illinois is not going to be proud of the fact that AL GORE wants to raise gasoline taxes as part of a program for a ``coordinated global program to accomplish the strategic goal of completely eliminating the internal combustion engine.'' 
   So we are offering a sense of the Senate today to say we are not for that. He may be for it. AL GORE is for it. He says he is for it. He wrote the book. He said he was for it as late as 4-26-99. The point is, not that he is not for it--he is for it --but that we are against it. That is the purpose of this amendment. 
   Should we be debating the Presidential campaign on the floor of the Senate? I do not know whether we should or not. But since our colleague from Illinois decided to bring it up, I thought we ought to give people an alternative. It is the same choice they are going to have on election day, on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of this year. 
   It is a profound choice. The lives of every American family will be changed if we repeal the death tax, if we repeal the marriage penalty, if we cut tax rates. The life of every American family will be changed if we have confiscatory taxes on gasoline to achieve some extremist goal of eliminating the internal combustion engine. 
   Improve it? Yes. Make it more efficient? Yes. Make it more environmental friendly? Yes. But kiss it and modern civilization good-bye as part of some extremist environmental agenda? I say, no. I say, no. I believe the Senate will say no today. They are going to say no today. I would not be surprised if all 100 Senators said no. 
   The American people are going to say no in November. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President after listening to that, I feel like a mosquito in a nudist colony. I don't know quite where to hit. 
   Let me start at the beginning. Bill Clinton's plan was not just the largest tax increase in American history; it was a stimulation package of $16 billion where spending exploded before the tax increase ever went into effect. Republicans in the Senate killed that stimulation plan. 
   Bill Clinton's plan was to have the Government take over and run the health care bill. I remember distinctly somebody standing up and saying the Clinton health care bill will pass over my cold, dead, political body. That political body is still alive and the Clinton health care bill is dead. 
   Bill Clinton, when he sent Congress a budget in 1995, proposed a $200 billion deficit, and his budget had a $200 billion deficit through this year. Who lost their jobs? When we killed the Clinton health care bill and defeated the stimulus package, they lost their jobs. We elected a Republican majority in both Houses of Congress. When we elected a Republican majority, we rejected the Clinton budget and the deficit started to go away and we have a surplus today. 
   In terms of a reasonable policy to protect the environment, forgive me, but completely eliminating the internal combustion engine is not a reasonable policy to protect the environment. It is an extremist policy that deserves to be rejected and it will be rejected. They are ashamed of it. 
   I ask the following question: How is he going to eliminate the internal combustion engine? Maybe they are just going to confiscate the cars or trucks. Maybe they are going to take us off to prison. 
   If you don't do it with taxes, how do you do it? The point is, they don't know how you would do it--at least they don't know before the election. The American people are going to want to know. 
   They are for eliminating the marriage penalty--baloney. Where's the beef? Their tax cut actually raises taxes for 5 years. Middle-income Americans would get virtually no tax relief under their policy. 
   Finally, as to this ``tax the wealthy,'' what a phony issue that is. In the President's first budget, they proposed raising taxes on people earning $25,000 a year who were drawing Social Security. That is what they call ``rich.'' 
   They were able to take a family making $44,000 a year and under Clinton's first budget make it $75,000 by saying: To tax somebody, you count the rent value of the home they own; you count the value of their life insurance; you count the value of their parking place. 
   To the Democrats, anybody who works and makes money is rich. Whenever we try to cut anybody's taxes, they are always rich. They have every excuse in the world to do anything except to give the American people a tax cut. 
   Finally, let me say again the part of the story that they are not telling is the following: Their budget, which they support, proposes that over the next 5 years we spend $494 billion on new and expanded programs. 
   That is the Clinton budget. 
   What Governor Bush is proposing is that rather than spend all this money on these programs, we give part of it back to working families. Why is it not risky for us to spend $494 billion on new programs, which is the Clinton budget that they support, and why is it risky for Governor Bush to propose giving less than that amount back to families to let them spend it? 
   I have 3 minutes remaining. I yield to Senator DOMENICI.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in his book ``Earth in the Balance,'' the Vice President calls for the complete elimination of the internal combustion engine. 
   I have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that says we should not undertake that activity, that raising the price of gasoline to the degree that would be required to achieve that goal would be devastating to the American economy. 
   I believe the Vice President saying we should have a policy to completely eliminate the internal combustion engine in 25 years is irresponsible policy. It ought to be rejected. The only way to achieve it would be astronomical taxes, rationing, and confiscating people's cars or trucks. I want the world to know and the Vice President to know we are against it.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would hate to have to make a living negotiating with Senator STEVENS. In the dull moments when we sit here and listen to some droning speech and look at the names written in our desk drawers--many of which we do not even recognize and never heard of--my guess is that someday people will see Senator STEVENS' name in one of these drawers and they will know who he was. 
   I believe we have a stronger budget as a result of this agreement. I think we have a stronger enforcement process as a result of this agreement because Senator DOMENICI and I had words written on paper, but we didn't have a consensus in the majority party to enforce those words. We have that consensus today. 
   I take the word of the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska to be more powerful and worth more than points of order. When he says he will lead the effort to the best of his ability to live within the nondefense discretionary numbers of this budget and to stay with the limit we have agreed to on advanced appropriations, I believe that is the strongest enforcement mechanism we can have. 
   We have preserved our 60-vote point of order for emergencies that are nondefense in nature. Senator STEVENS raised the point that in an emergency for defense, you could require a supermajority, and if you had a partisan issue on defense, you could deny the ability to meet the defense needs of the Nation. A point well made and a point well taken. 
   But we have the enforcement mechanism that prevents the piling of items of a nondefense nature into bills and designating them as emergencies when, in fact, they are not emergencies. 
   We kept the firewalls so when we get money for defense, it stays in defense. We have adjusted the advanced appropriation level to the level we had last year, the level that is in the House, with a strong 60-vote point of order to hold it in place. We prohibit nondefense delayed obligations, which is an important new power in the budget process. We have a unified Republican commitment to live within a discretionary budget written here and to stay with that number through the process. 
   This has been a long and difficult negotiation. We are dealing with people who have jobs to do. I think as a result of this agreement we can move forward together to do that job. I thank Senator DOMENICI. I thank Senator STEVENS. I believe we have a good product. I believe it is worthy of support. I believe we have a fighting chance to hold it through the appropriations process. If we do, the Nation will be the big beneficiary. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am sure that anybody following this debate might get confused as to what the Democrats are for, but there is not any way on Earth they can fail to figure out what they are against. They are against a tax cut. 
   They are against eliminating the marriage penalty. They are perfectly willing to allow the Tax Code, which penalizes people who fall in love and get married, to stand. 
   They are opposed to repealing the death tax. They are perfectly willing to leave in place a Tax Code that says: You work your whole life to build up a family business or a family farm, you pay taxes on every dollar you earn, and when you die, your children still may be forced to sell off the business or sell off the farm to give the Federal Government another 55 percent of your life's work. 
   They are against those things, and in trying to kill the tax cut, they are for many other things. 
   As to education, there are a lot of reasons for which one can criticize this budget, but not spending enough money on education is simply not one of them. This budget provides $47.9 billion for the Department of Education, which is $600 million more than the President proposed. In fact, last year in our budget and in the appropriations process, we spent more money on education than the President proposed. 
   Unless we get carried away with euphoria and believe that spending a whole bunch of money on education is somehow going to change anything, that somehow having a smaller class size is going to improve performance--we have been lowering class size since 1965 and performance has been declining. 
   The real debate about education is about whether or not we ought to be the national school board in Congress or whether we ought to let the States decide how to spend this money. That is the real debate between Democrats and Republicans. Democrats believe we ought to have Congress say how the money is going to be spent, and Republicans believe we ought to let the States say how the money is going to be spent. 
   Mr. President, Senator DOMENICI yielded me 30 minutes to speak. I ask  unanimous consent that the 30 minutes come off the resolution.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to talk about the evolution of this budget. I want to talk about the last 8 years of the Clinton administration and how we came to be where we are today with a balanced budget. 
   The one thing about history is everybody wants to rewrite it to suit themselves, but facts are persistent things. 
   What I want to do today is begin with the first budget President Clinton ever submitted to the Congress. I want to trace his budgets through Congress until we get to the last budget he will ever submit to Congress, which is the one we are considering today. 
   The objective is to basically try to get a clear picture of what has been proposed and what has been done. 
   When President Clinton took office, he sent to the Congress on February 17 of 1993 a budget entitled ``A Vision of Change for America.'' 
   I have the budget in my hand today. Many people have made a great point about the fact that the President did impose the largest tax increase in American history, but the result of it was a balanced budget. 
   I begin by noting that on page 22 of the first budget President Clinton ever submitted to Congress, the deficit he started with was $319 billion. His first act as President, in addition to proposing the largest tax increase in American history, was to raise that deficit in 1993 from $319 billion to $332 billion. He did that by proposing that spending actually go up by 
   more than his tax increase in the first year and, in fact, he proposed a stimulus package of $16.262 billion of brand new spending. 
   Some of my colleagues will remember the proposal was to spend this out of a projects book. We were able to defeat this proposal on the floor of the Senate, after it passed the House, by pointing out that in this projects book were such proposals as an ice skating warming hut in Connecticut and an alpine slide in Puerto Rico. 
   In the last budget that was adopted when the Democrats had a majority in Congress--and I have the conference report from that fiscal year 1995 budget, which was adopted on May 4 of 1994--that budget has on page 4 their deficit for fiscal year 1995 which, not counting the money that was being plundered from Social Security, was $239.5 billion. It was projected to rise in 1996 to $253 billion, in 1997 to $278 billion, in 1998 to $281 billion, and finally, the fiscal year 1999 deficit they were projecting in the last budget when the Democrats controlled Congress was going to be $300.7 billion. 
   When the American people looked at those numbers and looked at the Clinton health care bill which proposed having the Government take over and run the health care system, they elected a Republican majority. 
   When the Republican majority showed up in January of 1995, it was greeted by the President's fiscal year 1996 budget. This was a budget that Bill Clinton sent to the Republican Congress in February 1995. Actually he began to write it in large part before he knew there would be a Republican Congress. That budget proposed in January of 1995 that we adopt a budget that had a deficit of $203 billion, and it proposed in the year 2000 that the deficit would be $194.4 billion. This was the budget that Bill Clinton submitted to the new Republican Congress. 
   In 1995, Bill Clinton was asked on many occasions, because the Republican Congress started talking about balancing the budget, when he thought we could balance the budget. He had many different answers. This is what he said in 1995: How many years will it take to balance the budget? He said: Nine years. 
   Then he was asked the question again, and he said: Well, 10 years. 
   Then he said 8 years. 
   Then he said 9 years. 
   Then he said 7 years. 
   Then he said 7 to 9 years. 
   Then he said 7 years. 
   Then he said 9 years. 
   And then he said 10 years. 
   These are all statements that President Clinton made in 1995 when Republicans on the floor of the House and on the floor of the Senate, for the first time in the modern era, were talking about balancing the Federal budget. 
   He was saying: Yes, we might balance the budget. We could balance it 4 years after I leave office; 5 years after I leave office; 3 years after I leave office. But he never, ever proposed that we balance the budget while he was President. Nor did he ever submit any budgets that would require it, until it had already been accomplished. 
   What happened to the deficit? When Congress arrived in January of 1995, this was the Clinton budget proposal as it related to the deficit: Basically, it was a $200 billion deficit that went on forever. The American people in 1994 elected a Republican majority in Congress, and it took office in 1995. I ask the people to look at what happened to the deficit under a Republican Congress. 
   The deficit fell very rapidly, and by 1998 we had a balanced Federal budget. 
   Let me, if I might, make the following point, and do it in taking the President's new budget. First of all, there is one thing that is totally consistent in every Clinton budget. For 8 years, he has submitted budgets, and in every year they have had one thing in common: massive increases in nondefense discretionary spending.

   Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object. I was passed a note saying, given the makeup of time, that it would be helpful if I would ask for 30 minutes off the resolution. I made that request. If the Senator objects to it, I will be glad to withdraw it.

   Mr. GRAMM. I was not a party to the agreement. I really did not know the details of the agreement. I was simply trying to accommodate other people who wanted to debate the amendment. I did not get an opportunity yesterday, because I was working on a lot of other things, to talk about the budget itself. Normally I resent deals that I am not part of, but in this case I would be happy to try to comply with it. 
   The point I wish to make, in concluding, in looking at the 8 years of the Clinton budget, is that on one point they are totally consistent; and that point is, they always proposed dramatic increases in nondefense discretionary spending. It is an interesting paradox that in the first budget that President Clinton ever proposed, his first proposal was to increase nondefense discretionary by 12.5 percent. We rejected it when we rejected his stimulus package. In the last budget that he will ever propose, remarkably, he proposes to increase nondefense discretionary by 12.5 percent, which brings me to my final point on the budget. 
   Increasingly, we are hearing from our Democrat colleagues, and we are hearing, in fact, from the President and from the Vice President, that somehow our effort to let working people keep more of what they earn is risky, that somehow repealing the marriage penalty is risky, that somehow repealing the death tax is risky. I guess they say it is risky because that is money that we are giving back to the American people. 
   But I would ask my colleagues to understand and remember that if you take last year's budget, and you take President Clinton's proposal for this year's budget, he is proposing an increase in spending over the 5 years--from 2002 to 2006--he is proposing new  spending of $494 billion. That is brand new spending in this budget. Some 80 new programs in this budget would be funded at a level of $494 billion above the level we are spending now. 
   So what President Clinton is saying, what Vice President GORE is saying, what our Democrat colleagues are saying, is, let us start 80 new programs and let us spend $494 billion. 
   It is interesting. My Governor, who has been criticized by the President and the Vice President, and many of our Democrat colleagues, said: No. Let's take $483 billion and give it back to working Americans by repealing things such as the marriage penalty and by repealing things such as the death tax. 
   Here is what I do not understand. Why is it risky to give $483 billion of non-Social Security surplus back to working families but it is not risky to spend $494 billion on some 80 new programs? Why is it risky to let the American families spend the money and why is it not risky to let the Government spend the money? Do our Democrat colleagues believe that the Government can spend this money better than the family can spend it? Does anybody believe that if we have a crisis that we will really go back and eliminate these 80 programs and get the $494 billion back? If we did, it would make history because we have not done it. There have been numerous occasions that Congress has raised taxes after giving a tax cut. 
   I simply repeat the point that gets lost in all this political rhetoric, with all the talk about debt reduction: You have to go back to when Jimmy Carter was President to find a budget that spends as much money as does the new Clinton budget. It spends $494 billion on new programs over the next 5 years. That is more money than anyone has talked about in terms of tax cuts. Why is it risky to give the money back to working people and not risky to have Government spend it? That is the unanswered question in this whole debate. 
   Let me conclude by making two additional points. We have had a lot of amendments on Medicare. The President is talking about Medicare. I want to remind my colleagues that five Members of the Senate and 12 other Americans who had some knowledge of Medicare and health care in general were appointed to a bipartisan commission where President Clinton appointed four of the members; the leadership of both Houses appointed six members each; and they jointly appointed a Chairman, Senator JOHN BREAUX. 
   With all this talk about Medicare, we had an emerging consensus in the Breaux commission that would have reformed Medicare and would have provided prescription drugs to Americans who had a modest income and had a difficult time paying for their pharmaceutical benefits. 
   We would have done it in the context of reform, where we did not jeopardize other Medicare benefits, where we did not jeopardize the pharmaceutical coverage that other Americans had who had the ability to pay for it; but we had a responsible, bipartisan reform program, and we provided pharmaceuticals for seniors who needed the help. Help those who need the help; do not destroy the coverage of those who already have it--roughly 65 percent of all seniors--and do not jeopardize the future of Medicare. It was a pretty good proposal. 
   What happened to the Breaux commission report? It failed by one vote because every single appointee of President Clinton voted no. So while we have all this rhetoric today about Medicare, I think it is important to remember that the Medicare commission failed by one vote to reach a consensus, and four of the ``no'' votes were by the four people the President appointed. At some point, I would like to get that commission back together to try again to come up with a bipartisan solution. 
   A final point, and then I will yield the floor. 
   What we have shown on this chart is the history of spending on nondefense discretionary spending. This is money that we are not required by law to spend on things such as Medicare and Social Security. These are discretionary programs. And we are not talking about defense. We are talking about nondefense programs. 
   What this shows is, over the last 5 years we have done a relatively good job of controlling spending. 
   The President has consistently urged us to start massive new spending sprees, but we have refused to do that over the 5-year period. 
   One of the reasons this budget has been difficult to write is that in looking at the last 5 years individually, in 1996, when we had just elected a Republican majority, we actually were able to reduce spending in real terms by 4.1 percent. Then real spending grew by 1.8 in 1997; 0.8 in 1998; 3.6 percent in 1999; and then by a whopping real 4.7 percent in the year 2000. 
   The point is, there is a real danger that this surplus is going to burn a hole in our pocket. There is a real danger that in the midst of this great opportunity to rebuild the base of Social Security, to reform Medicare and provide prescription benefits to people who cannot afford the benefits themselves, with an opportunity to let working Americans who face the highest tax rates ever in American history keep more of what they earn, unless we are careful, we are going to end up spending this non-Social Security surplus. 
   We will have some votes later today or tomorrow where there will be efforts to strike points of order in the budget which represent our discipline in trying to stay with the budget we have adopted. Despite all the rhetoric about cuts, there are no cuts in this budget. Defense spending grows by almost 5 percent, and nondefense spending grows faster than inflation. How many families in America would say they have a lower family budget if their income grew by more than inflation did this year? Nobody would say that. But then we are not constrained to logic or reason or fact when we are talking about these budgets. 
   I urge my colleagues, in this golden moment of economic prosperity, when revenues are gushing into the Treasury, when Americans are working and prospering and rejoicing in it, we have an opportunity to fix Social Security forever with an investment-based system so that we don't have to cut benefits of people who are retired today and so that young people will own their own investments to pay for their retirement. We have an opportunity to fix Medicare with reasonable reforms that promote economy and efficiency and that help people who cannot afford pharmaceuticals to get them without destroying the coverage that 65 percent of our citizens have. And we have a chance to do things that need to be done--repeal the marriage penalty, repeal the death tax. 
   If we keep this spending spree underway, if we keep spending more and more money, in the end those things are not going to get done. What we need to do is to try to exercise the kind of responsibility that American families exercise when they look further than just the moment, when they look at their future and look at the problems they face and opportunities they have. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I understand the Democrat leader has a statement to make. Let me just say to our colleagues, we are going to take up the bill providing loan guarantees to those who would develop the technology and make the investments to bring local television to rural America. We expect there to be opening statements this morning. Let me say, since there is no one here on the other side to debate the issue, I intend at some point to ask unanimous consent that we might have an hour or so for opening statements and then I might be recognized to offer an amendment at that point. If there is an objection to that, then I will go ahead and offer an amendment at the conclusion of my statement. 
   Let me say we should have votes throughout the day. We are confident we will finish this bill today--or we hope to. 
   Following the disposition of this bill, there will be a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the gasoline tax legislation. After the cloture vote, the Senate will begin a period of morning business with statements expected by Senator BROWNBACK on the marriage penalty. 
   I thank our colleagues for their attention. 
   Mr. President, before I go into a discussion of the bill, I ask unanimous consent I might yield to the Democrat leader to make a statement on his leadership time, and then that I might be recognized to make the initial opening statement.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, at the end of the last session of Congress, we passed a very important piece of legislation establishing the legal framework whereby local television stations and satellites could negotiate contracts under which television broadcasts could be carried by satellite. 
   In the midst of that conference, a sizable majority of the conference committee members from the House and the Senate concluded there was a problem in rural America that the bill they were considering would not address: that there were substantial economic impediments to the development of systems that would deliver the local television broadcast into remote, isolated, and rural areas of the country. 
   In trying to deal with this situation, with all the time constraints in the midst of a conference, an effort was made to write a loan guarantee into that bill. That loan guarantee program has subsequently been offered in the House and is pending before the House committee. And when I talk about it again, I will be talking about the bill as introduced in the House. 
   There was great concern at that time about how the system would work and what it would cost. As a result of numerous negotiations and a lot of good will, a decision was made to drop that provision at the end of the last session with a commitment I made that, by the end of this month, we would report a loan guarantee bill from the Banking Committee to address this very real concern. I am happy to say that on a bipartisan basis we reported such a bill by unanimous vote and we, in doing so, fulfilled the commitment we made at the end of the last session. 
   Rather than go through a fairly complicated bill in detail, I will focus in my opening statement on the problems we face--why it is difficult--why there are economic perils involved--in guaranteeing loans to do something that has never been done before using technology that is unproven, why it is so expensive to do this, and then how we have tried to deal with each of these problems. 
   It is important to remember that when the Congressional Budget Office looked at the loan guarantee program pending in the House of Representatives, they concluded that of the loan guarantees that would be made--and let's be precise, a loan guarantee is where the taxpayers are committed to stand in the place of the borrower should the borrower default--roughly 45 percent of the $1.25 billion worth of loans made under that bill will be defaulted. 
   When I say defaulted, I am not saying just that the borrower would be unable to pay that face amount. I am saying that if one looks at the CBO estimate--which is an estimate of the present value of the losses they estimate will arrive, remembering that a loss 20 years from now is discounted using the Government's cost of borrowing--what they concluded was, as the bill is structured in the House, we were looking at the potential of the taxpayers paying 45 percent of the cost of these loan guarantees as a result of their being defaulted and ultimately not being repaid. 
   The Banking Committee, in looking at this number, concluded that it presented an unacceptable risk for the American taxpayer. 
   Sometimes people get confused by these estimated CBO costs because the cost often looks low because it is the present value of a default which would occur 10 years, 20 years, even 25 years from now. 
   But basically, the CBO analysis of the House bill is that we are looking at a potential default rate of about 45 percent. 
   How did we try to deal with that? 
   We held a set of hearings where we heard from experts in industry, and we worked with the Congressional Budget Office. We decided there were two ways we could reduce the probability the taxpayer was going to end up paying off these loans. 
   One way we could do would be to set up a board that could exercise independent judgment as to the quality of the project being proposed and the risks that were involved, and that we could put someone who was responsible, who had knowledge of financial markets, and who was responsible to the taxpayer, in a position to make that judgment. 
   We concluded we should have a board made up of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and the Secretary of Agriculture, or their designees--but their designees would have to be people who were appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. 
   Our first line of defense is the good judgment and prudence of the three people on this board. The House would give that basically to a Government agency, but we have rejected that. 
   Our second and, by far, our more important line of defense is that we do not guarantee the entire loan. The loan would have only an 80-percent guarantee. 
   What this means is, when a private lender makes this loan, they are going to be liable for 20 percent. The protection we get from that requirement is not just that they lose the first 20 percent, and then we lose the other 80 percent, if the loan goes bad--that is important; and we guarantee that the taxpayer is protected first, unlike the House bill--but what we get is far more important because with a private lender, if they are liable for 20 percent of the money, they are going to perform their due diligence, they are going to scrutinize this loan, and they are going to realize that if the loan goes bad, they are going to lose 20 percent of the money they have lent. 
   As we initially wrote this bill--in fact, the language of the bill as reported out of the Banking Committee I will amend in our first amendment today in an effort to reach a compromise--the logic was that we would have a private lender. The language of the bill requires that they be FDIC insured, that they would make the loan, and that they would be liable for 20 percent of the cost. 
   Why is this so important? We are not talking about making a loan to deliver electricity to rural America, where we have a captive customer base, where someone cannot buy electricity from anybody else. We are not talking about making a loan to deliver telephone service to rural America where you either buy from the telephone co-op or you do not have a telephone. We are talking about a very risky business where there will be no guaranteed ratepayer. Nothing in this bill--nothing in law--requires any American living in a rural area to buy these services. So there is no captive base. When we get to the discussion of the amendment I will offer, we are going to be discussing this in detail because this is very important. 
   The second important risk is, no one has ever done what we are proposing to do. We have one company proposing to use a satellite, which has a directed beam so that it would send a signal into a geographic area, and they are pretty confident it is going to work. In fact, they are going to invest over $1 billion to build such a system to basically service these top 40 markets in terms of 
   viewership. 
   But the plain truth is, no one has ever used that satellite. So while we hope it will work, while we have reason to believe it will work, and while the fact that somebody is willing to invest $1 billion in it suggests to me it might very well work, we do not know it will work. It has never been proven on the scale we are talking about. 
   But there is a second and more fundamental risk. It is one that I think, in our rush to do something here, we want to look beyond. It is not the risk that the technology does not work. 
   Let's say we are talking about a satellite--and our bill is neutral in terms of technology--but let's say someone comes in and asks for a loan of $1.25 billion to build and launch and put into orbit a directed beam satellite. Obviously, you have the risk that somehow the system does not work, it is not launched into orbit. Maybe they would buy insurance. I assume a lender would require that. Maybe it would work; maybe it wouldn't work. 
   But let's say it does work. The biggest risk you face in dealing with new technology is we have no guarantee, that if someone borrowed $1.25 billion and we guaranteed 80 percent of it --and it worked perfectly--that 2 years from now some young computer genius, getting a degree in computer science at Texas A&M, might not develop a technology that would use the Internet to deliver the local TV signal and would do it at one one-thousandth of the cost of this satellite. 
   I say to my colleagues, if that happened, obviously, it would be a godsend for rural America because then everybody would have local television, and they would have it inexpensively, but it would not be a godsend for the taxpayer because we all know that if that happened, which would be the answer to someone's prayer, it would not be the answer to the taxpayer's prayer. The company that launched that satellite and invested $1.25 billion in it would lose every customer they had to someone who could sell for one one-thousandth of their cost. 
   Let me say, this isn't just theoretical, this is happening every day in America. 
   The taxpayer would be on the hook for over $800 million of losses. 
   This is risky business, which is why the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the House bill will have a default rate of roughly 45 cents out of every $1 that is loaned. That is risky business. 
   We have tried to deal with this by establishing a loan board to exercise due diligence, requiring a private lender, as it is now written, and an FDIC-insured lender, so basically we are talking about an institution that is in business to make money, and they are going to be making loans. 
   They can make loans to anybody--to REA or to a private, for-profit company. They know as the bill is now written, they are going to be liable for 20 percent of that loan. If it goes bad, they will lose that money. 
   It is my understanding that we are going to have a series of amendments that assault, in my opinion, these two basic protections of this bill. One amendment, which has been discussed, is the amendment to let Government lend the money. I totally and absolutely reject that. If we let Government lend any of this money, we destroy the whole foundation of this bill. Our protection is, if Chase Manhattan is lending this money, they are liable for 20 percent of the money. If the loan goes bad, they lose that money, and somebody will probably lose their job. So they are going to be paying attention to their business. 
   On the other hand, if we allow an amendment which says the Government can make the loan guaranteed part directly, we are eliminating some of the due diligence that is at the very heart of this bill and which CBO has scored as lowering the cost of this loan by $100 million. 
   The second proposal that is going to be made, a proposal I am going to accept but with a very important amendment, relates to the CFC, which is the Cooperative Finance Corporation. This is basically a captive lender of the REA. It is an entity that is given tax exemption. Why is it given tax exemption? It is given tax exemption because it is serving a public purpose: it is a lending institution that historically has lent money to REAs to provide telephone service and electric power. 
   The important difference between a loan to provide telephone service or electric power and a loan to launch a satellite or to invest in an unproven technology is twofold. One, we have been doing phones a long time. We have been generating power for over 100 years. We know how to do it. There is no uncertainty about the technology of  telephones and power generation in a traditional sense. 
   Second, in these activities, they have captive customers. Where I am an REA customer, I can't buy power from anybody else. So if a mistake is made, there is an easy way to cover it up--raise my rates. There won't be an easy way to cover up a mistake here because there won't be any captive ratepayer whose rate can be raised. 
   Let me make it clear, I have the highest opinion of the CFC. I think it has done a great job. It was chartered and given a tax subsidy to do that job in the public interest, and I think it does that job well. But I believe we are taking an unnecessary risk in letting the CFC make these loans. I am willing to do that as part of an effort to have a bipartisan compromise but only under the following circumstances: 
   No. 1, what we are being asked to do is take out of the bill the requirement that the lender be FDIC insured. When we do that, we open up this whole process to institutions that we may never have considered. So we have two sort of boilerplate requirements. One is, if it is a traditional financial institution, they have to meet two requirements: First, no self-dealing; that is, they can't lend the money to themselves, so to speak; and, second, they have to meet the normal capital requirement, which is, you can't lend more than 10 or, in some cases, 15 percent of your capital to any one borrower. 
   Now, for the CFC, we don't impose--in the final compromise I offered last night--the 10-percent loan to one borrower restriction. I would prefer it, but I know that some of my colleagues are opposed to it because CFC is opposed to it. 
   What we require is the following: To be sure we are talking about CFC and not some other Government or some other nonprofit entity that none of us have thought about, we say that to qualify, a nonprofit institution must have one of the three highest credit 
   ratings on a long-term bond. Some people have gotten confused between a credit rating on a long-term bond and a credit rating on any commercial paper. Almost any institution can issue a 30-day note that will be AAA rated. We are talking about lending for 25 years here, so the fact that somebody can get a good rating for short-term borrowing, what we want to know is their rating for long-term lending. That is what is significant. 
   The first requirement is that those nonprofits that can participate must have one of the top three ratings and the Cooperative Finance Corporation qualifies. 
   The second requirement, which I think is of equal importance, is that the board must find that by making this loan the Cooperative Finance Corporation will not see its credit rating decline, that in making the loan they are not jeopardizing the good credit they have. 
   Why is that important? We have, as best I can estimate--and we are trying to get the final number--25 million Americans who are captive ratepayers. They are customers of REA for telephone and for electric power--one or the other and, in some cases, both. If the rating of the CFC in borrowing money to lend principally to co-ops is diminished by making this loan, every ratepayer of every co-op in America will end up paying more because this happened. We want to prevent that from happening. I am going to argue all day long, if I have to, that we should not imperil 25 million Americans who are captive ratepayers by allowing CFC to get into a risky business that can push down their credit rating. 
   What I am proposing and will propose in the first amendment, when the general debate is over, is that we let CFC make the loans but that the board has to find that, in making the loans, CFC is not going to downgrade its creditworthiness, and in the process impose new costs on ratepayers. 
   Finally, if their creditworthiness does decline, then they would be required, in an arm's length transaction, to sell this note on the open market. I think these are important requirements. 
   Someone may argue that the CFC has engaged in providing television services. That is a real stretch because what really happened is the co-ops borrowed $100 million to enter into a contract with Direct Television where they were the marketing arm of Direct Television. As it turns out, over 80 percent of what they were doing, they have subsequently sold off to a private company named Pegasus that is a long way from launching a satellite and engaging in this business. 
   Let me sum up. 
   I think we have put together a well-crafted bill. To this point, this bill costs $100 million less than the House bill. It is still risky business. Let's remember that if this loan is defaulted, rural America is probably going to lose its television service. 
   I hope my colleagues will look at the amendment I have offered, and I hope it can be accepted. 
   I thank all members of the Banking Committee, Republicans and Democrats, for the bipartisanship we had in committee. 
   I thank Senator CONRAD BURNS. I thank him for his leadership. There is no question that we would not be here today were it not for his persistence. I also thank him for not only trying to get television signals to rural America but trying to do it in the right way. It is very easy when you are trying to deal with all the groups that hope to benefit from some program such as this to just throw caution to the wind and say don't worry about the cost. I thank Senator BURNS not only for the leadership in seeing that we are writing this bill, but for his leadership in seeing that we are doing it right. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me try to explain the amendment and what the issue is. I know there are strong feelings on both sides of the issue. I believe we have worked out 95 percent of the bill to everybody's satisfaction. But we now have come down to an issue. I really believe that while there will be extraneous amendments offered, this and possibly one other amendment might be the only amendments we will be actively debating. 
   Let me first explain what the bill now does. Then I would like to explain the changes my amendment makes, why I am making them, and then I would like to address the overall issue we are about to debate, potentially through a second-degree amendment or through another freestanding amendment. 
   In the bill as it is now written--as it passed unanimously in committee, even though I knew an amendment was going to be offered--in order to make a loan that the Federal Government guarantees, you have to be an insured depository institution. There has been objection raised to this because of a desire on the part of the Cooperative Finance Corporation. This is a captive lender, for all purposes, for America's REAs, with a very proud record and with a great record of achievement. 
   The question then is, if we take out of the bill that a lender has to be FDIC insured--and remember we are having the taxpayer guarantee the loan they are making--What kind of protections do we need for that guarantee to be extended? I have offered this amendment, really, as an effort at a compromise where we take the FDIC lender out but where we set specifically three sets of rules to apply to different lenders. 
   The first two have to do with commercial for-profit lenders. They are the standard kind of constraints you would normally see in any financial transaction; that is, they have to meet the capital requirement which traditionally, for banks and S&Ls, has been that you cannot lend more than 10 percent or 15 percent of your capital to any one borrower. 
   Second, we eliminate the potential for any for-profit institution to lend to an affiliate. What we are trying to do here is ban self-dealing. I do not believe there is any objection to these two provisions, but it is very important that they be in the bill. 
   Now we get to the controversy. What do we do about nonprofit lenders? Let me remind my colleagues, institutions are not nonprofit for nothing. We grant a very special privilege to an institution when we make it a nonprofit institution because we dramatically lower its costs. And we do it because that institution is serving a public purpose.  
   In this case, the institution that is basically going to be discussed here is CFC, the Cooperative Finance Corporation. Its public purpose is that it provides funding at a very low cost to our REAs that are providing telephone and electric power to rural America. It is true that it makes some other loans, but the principal purpose for its lending is REA power and REA telephone. 
   What we are saying is for these nonprofits, since they are carrying out a Government function, even though they may be chartered as private institutions, they are chartered with tax exemption because they are promoting a public purpose. Therefore, we do have some concern about them. 
   Now, if Citigroup or Bank of America or Chase makes this loan and it is defaulted and they lose 20 percent of it, I am not happy about it--and I am very unhappy about the taxpayer losing 80 percent--but I figure they are in this for profit. They know what they are doing and what they do to their credit rating and what they do to their profitability; that is their business. That is what for-profit private enterprise is about. 
   I am more concerned about what a nonprofit corporation does because it is nonprofit and it is carrying out a public purpose. In the case of CFC, that public purpose is to make loans to bring 
   electric power and telephone, and to continually modernize both to rural America. More important, they are lending money to 25 million captive customers. Why do I say captive? Because if you are buying power from the REA, you do not have the right to buy it from anybody else. If you are buying telephone services through an REA affiliate, you do not have the right to buy telephone services from anybody else, on a hard line anyway. So in making loans, these nonprofits, and principally CFC, are carrying out a public mandate in providing these services for rural America as cheaply as possible. 
   Why should there be a certain set of rules for nonprofit corporations? Because they are nonprofit; because they do have tax exemption; because they are supposed to be promoting a public purpose. If Citigroup or Bank of America makes a bad loan and it is defaulted, people do not have to do business with them. They can borrow money from somebody else. But if the CFC makes a bad loan and their credit rating goes down, then every REA customer for electric power and telephone, all of whom are captive customers, would have to pay higher prices; hence, the public interest in seeing that we protect the interests of those ratepayers. 
   How do we protect the interests of the ratepayers in this amendment? I have colleagues on both sides of the aisle who want the CFC to be able to make these loans. Frankly, if this were left to me, I would not do it that way. The whole logic of this is for-profit lending. But in an effort to try to reach a compromise, we would let CFC, this tax-exempt entity which is providing credit to rural America, make these loans. But the board would have to find, in making the loan, that they would not lower their credit rating. 
   Why is that important? Why should we care what the credit rating of CFC is? Because that credit rating affects their ability to borrow money, affects the interest they have to pay, and since they are in turn lending that money to REA providers who have captive American customers--25 million of them--if they do something speculative and drive down their bond rating, everybody in rural America is going to pay more money for electric power and telephones. 
   The restriction we are imposing is hardly overwhelming. All it says is, where we are dealing with a nonprofit lender, where the Congressional Budget Office has estimated the probability of default is such that 45 percent of the loan will be defaulted under the House bill, if they want to make this loan, doesn't it sound reasonable on behalf of the 25 million ratepayers in rural America that we would simply ask that the board--the Secretary of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, and the Secretary of Agriculture--that they determine that the CFC is not going to see its bond rating go down as a result of making this loan? 
   Why do we care if it goes down? Because if it goes down, every buyer of electricity, every buyer of telephone services in rural America, is going to pay more money. That is why we should care. So we say, if the board finds that this is not going to lower their credit rating, they can do it. 
   We have a provision that says, if the CFC's credit rating is lowered--and credit rating agencies, when they change somebody's credit, say why they have changed it, so that if they change it and the reason is this loan--we require the loan to be sold so it can move to restore their credit rating. 
   I believe this is an eminently reasonable amendment, and while it does not bear directly on the loan guarantee, it does bear directly on another issue, and that is the well-being of 25 million Americans who live in rural America. I represent more of them than any other Senator here. I am not indifferent to CFC taking action that will drive up interest rates and drive up power rates and telephone rates in my State to Texans who choose to live in rural areas. That is what this amendment is about. 
   This amendment, in responding to a request by Members of the Senate, takes out the requirement that you have to have an insured lender. That opens it up potentially to anybody. 
   We tighten it up in three ways. We say if you are a commercial lender--a bank, for example--you have to meet the capital requirements and the loan-asset ratio that is currently the law, and you cannot do self-dealing. You cannot lend it to your brother-in-law, and you cannot lend it to the bank. It has to be an arm's length transaction. 
   For those lenders, such as Morgan Stanley, that do not have a capital requirement, we say they have to have one. We are not going to guarantee a loan that Morgan Stanley makes if that loan is more than 10 percent of their capital. Why? Because it is risky, and if they lose money, it enhances the chances that the taxpayers will lose money. 
   Finally, for nonprofits, we do not have a capital requirement, but what we say is, since we gave this institution nonprofit status to perform a public purpose--in the case of CFC, to make loans to electrify and bring telephones to rural America--that if the board finds that by making this loan it is going to drive down their bond rating and drive up their cost of borrowing and, in turn, drive up power rates and phone rates for 25 million Americans, the board will be required to not guarantee their loan. I hope my colleagues will look at this provision. 
   Let me give an example. Under current market conditions, the 1-year cost of borrowing for dropping from a AA to a AA- is 5 basis points, or $500,000 on a $1 billion loan. Over 10 years, that would be $5 million. It is pretty relevant when one is talking about dropping a bond rating. If it just dropped by one notch, from AA to AA- on a 10-year loan, that 5 basis points will cost $5 million. If you drop from AA to BB, then the cost will drive by a great multiple of that. 
   This is a reasonable issue. It is not an issue directly involved in this loan, but it is an issue that, unfortunately, has gotten pulled into it. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will look at this very closely. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
   I think, as people try to follow this debate, it often looks complicated, but if they burrow into the real issue, it boils down to this: In trying to accommodate those who want the Cooperative Finance Corporation to participate in this program, I have taken from the bill in my amendment the requirement that the lender be FDIC insured. I have set out some conditions. For banks, I require that they meet a capital requirement and that they do not engage in self-dealing. That requirement is not in this amendment that would strike my amendment. Under this amendment, potentially we could have an 80-percent Government guaranteed loan to some institution that is lending the money to itself. I am opposed to that. I am adamantly opposed to that. I think that is an outrage. 
   Under this provision, we could have an institution lend all of its capital and the Federal Government is going to guarantee 80 percent of it. Under this amendment which strikes my amendment, some institution somewhere could lend 100 percent of its capital, and the Federal Government is going to guarantee 80 percent of it. I don't think so. Under the amendment I have offered, I have said that in such institutions, we are not going to guarantee their loan if they are lending more than 10 percent of their capital. This is taxpayers' money we are talking about. Both of those provisions are dropped. 
   This amendment does a curtsy toward fiscal responsibility in that it says for a lender to qualify, they have to have one of the top three ratings on at least one issue of outstanding debt. You can issue a 30-day note, and almost anybody can get a 
    AAA rating for their credit for 30 days, but the taxpayer is going to be on the hook for 25 years. The fact that a borrower could get a good rating for a 30-day note does not excite me very much, when the taxpayer is going to be on the hook for  25 years. And that does not even apply to the CFC. They don't have to have any capital requirement at all. Every other nonprofit institution does in their amendment, but not CFC. 
   Let me explain the issue of the CFC. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the loan guarantee in the House is going to have 45 percent of the loan defaulted. The scoring by the Congressional Budget Office of the House bill assumes 45 percent of the loan guarantee the Federal Government makes will be defaulted and that the taxpayer will be left holding the bag. That is what the present value of $350 million is when you are discounting on a 25-year bond. 
   This is risky business. We are lending money on a technology that has never worked anywhere. We are talking about totally new technology. I know there are people running around saying: We are going to have a directed beam satellite. Where are they? Show me one. Where is one working in the world today? They may work. 
   The point is, this is new technology. We are talking about somebody borrowing the money, launching a satellite, for example, using brand new technology, cutting it on, it works. Maybe it works; maybe it doesn't work. The Congressional Budget Office believes this is risky business. They assume 45 percent of the loan is not going to be repaid. 
   I have tried to build in protections, and those protections are critical. The most important protection is that a private lender is on the hook for 20 percent. 
   Our Presiding Officer used to be in the banking business. He did not often get an 80-percent Government loan guarantee, but when he was on the hook for 20 percent, he paid attention to his business because it was his money. The guarantee that we are getting is that people are going to be judicious with the part we are not guaranteeing. 
   Why do we treat nonprofits differently? What is this issue about credit rating of nonprofits? Why should Joe Brown who lives in San Geronimo Creek, TX, care about the credit rating of the Cooperative Finance Corporation when he is going to guarantee 80 percent of the loan they make? What difference does it make to him? 
   First of all, why do they have a tax exemption at the Cooperative Finance Corporation? Because we gave it to them to promote a public purpose. What was the public purpose? The public purpose was to provide electricity to rural America and to provide telephone to rural America and to keep it moderate. That is why they have a tax exemption--because they are providing a public purpose. 
   In letting them be involved in an activity where, under the conditions set in the House, 45 percent of the loan will be, according to the estimate of CBO, defaulted, all I have asked is that this nonprofit organization, or any other, since they are performing a public purpose by lending money to provide electricity in rural Texas and rural America, I want the board to find that their credit rating is not going to go down as a result of making this loan. 
   Now, our colleague from South Dakota says, what business is it of ours whether the credit rating of the Cooperative Finance Corporation goes down or not? It is my business. It is my business because I have over a million Texans who buy electric power and/or telephone from rural co-ops that borrow money from the CFC. That is why it is my business. If they make a bad loan and their credit rating goes down, the cost of borrowing money to maintain electric power and telephone in my State is going to go up, and my ratepayers, who are captive--they can't buy electric power from anybody else and they can't buy hard-line telephone services from anybody else--are going to end up paying more money. That is why I care. That is why it is relevant. 
   Now, this is risky business we are engaged in here. All I am trying to do is say, if you want the financial institution that has historically serviced REA and serviced electric power and telephone--and let me remind my colleagues you don't lose money lending money to an electric co-op to provide telephone or electric power generation. Why? Because you have a captive market so that if the loan doesn't work out, you raise the rates--you restructure the loan, you raise the rates to pay it. 
   In this case, if that satellite doesn't go into orbit, whose rates are you going to raise? You are going to raise the rates of people in Texas who are buying electric power. That is whose rates you are going to raise. That satellite doesn't work. You don't have anybody buying its services. They have a right not to buy them. You are not going to be able to raise their rates. So all I am trying to do is say before we let this lending institution, with a proud history, which has done a great job--and I don't dispute any of that--this tax-exempt lender that we gave tax exemption to electrify America and to provide phone services to America, before we have them make a loan that the Congressional Budget Office says 45 percent of, under the House structure, will be defaulted, before we let them do it--why is it so offensive to have, among other people, Alan Greenspan look at their loan and their proposal and try to make an estimate as to whether or not making this loan is going to drive down their bond rating and drive up the cost of electric power and telephone services in rural America? Do we not trust Alan Greenspan to make an honest judgment? 
   I don't understand this issue. It seems to me what we have is a captive lender that somehow desperately wants to get into a business we didn't give it tax exemption to do. We have a mission creep here on a gigantic scale. Now, I am willing to let them do the mission creep as long as it doesn't cost Texas consumers of electric power and telephone services in rural Texas money. If it is not going to cost them money, I am willing to let them basically dramatically change the business they are in. If they make a $1.25 billion loan, that is larger by far--twice as big--than any loan they have ever made. Their average loan is less than $20 million. I would say that is a pretty dramatic change in business. If we are going to let them do that, all I am asking is that there be somebody responsible--and I would call Alan Greenspan responsible--who is going to look at their application and make a determination as to whether this is going to drive down their bond rating and cost every REA customer in America a bunch of money. 
   The second provision is if, in fact, it does drive down 
   their bond rating, I want them to sell it and get out of that business. You might say how dare we tell them they can't engage in some of the most speculative lending in America. How dare we tell them that. Well, the reason we dare tell them that is they are tax exempt. We gave them a very special privilege to do a certain kind of work, and that special privilege was to bring electricity and telephone service to America. I know we have let them get into other kinds of business. We let them make a loan so that REAs could go into a partnership with Direct Television. But they didn't put up any satellite or develop any new technology, and they didn't take any real risk. This is big-time risk. 
   So the difference between the two amendments is, first of all, this amendment, in my opinion, is not very well crafted in that it strikes all of my provisions against self-dealing, all of the provisions in my amendment--and you don't have to worry about that when you are dealing with FDIC institutions because they have those requirements already. But those provisions in my amendment that were struck by this amendment are pretty important. If we are going to have the taxpayers on the hook for over $800 million, I want to be sure somebody is not lending this money to his brother in law, or to an affiliate of the company. I don't understand why those provisions were struck by this amendment. 
   Secondly, if we have a traditional REA lender in the Cooperative Finance Corporation making loans, I am willing to let them into this business if they want to get into it; though, to the best of my mental ability, I can't see why they want in this business. But they do. They are determined to get into it. I am saying, let them in the business, but don't let them in if it is going to drive up the cost of electric power and telephone service to rural America by driving down their bond rating. 
   I thought, when we made the concession to treat these nonprofits differently by not requiring them to meet a capital requirement for the size of their loans, that the compromise was  going to be accepted. But it seems to me that, basically, what we are trying to do is we are trying to go back and undo all the other stuff we have done in this bill because the logic of the bill is that we are going to have a private lender who is going to be on the hook. Now, some people say, won't the Cooperative Finance Corporation be on the hook? Who will be on the hook if they lose $800 million? Who really loses? Whose money is it? Well, ultimately, who is going to lose is the people who are buying electric power in America, in rural areas, and people who are buying telephone services, because they are going to lose a very cheap source of credit because the Cooperative Finance Corporation is going to end up losing its double-A rating. 
   So that is what this whole issue is about. Unfortunately, we have a series of votes in the Budget Committee, and we don't have proxy voting. It is going to require Senator JOHNSON, Senator SARBANES, and I to be there. 
   I ask unanimous consent that we set aside this amendment, that we let other amendments be offered in our absence, but that we don't reach a final disposition of any amendment until the hour of 1:30.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Louisiana for raising the obvious point that one of the  technologies that would be potentially subsidized under this bill is satellite technology. If you are going to have a satellite, you have to put it into orbit. We have been for some time in the process of trying to commercialize space. There are companies now that are beginning to respond to that potential with real investment and real potential. 
   The question the Senator from Louisiana asked was, Would not this be a good time to address this additional problem? Personally, I believe this is something that will have to be addressed and looked at. The big difference is, on the loan guarantee proposal before us, we have had a series of hearings. We have gone to great lengths to try to minimize the potential exposure to the taxpayer. We have tried to call in technical expertise to be sure we understand what we are doing. 
   In terms of expanding this program now on the floor of the Senate to launch vehicles, I don't see how we could possibly get that job done. I think this is, in terms of this bill, a bridge too far. I think it is something that will be looked at. I know, from having talked to them personally, there are at least two private companies that are interested in commercial launching to try to do in America what we are contracting out to France and to China. 
   We have two problems in considering this today. One is that under unanimous consent, only relevant amendments are in order. This amendment would be deemed to not be relevant, in my opinion. 
   Secondly, I could do my due diligence as chairman of the Banking Committee to agree to an add-on loan guarantee on the 
   floor of the Senate when we have not held a hearing, when we have not looked at it, when we know relatively little about the technology, the public/private competition, the economic feasibility of the project. We don't have any scoring from CBO as to what it would cost. It may very well be at some point, someday, we will be in a position of looking at the proposal that has been made by the distinguished Senator from Louisiana. I don't believe we are at that point today. 
   Obviously, the Senator has a right to offer his amendment. I do not believe we should adopt his amendment today. I think we are already carrying a pretty heavy load on this bill. In order for this to go forward as it is now written, the Appropriations Committee is going to have to appropriate a quarter of a billion dollars. I believe we would have a train that would be overloaded if we added this loan guarantee to it today. 
   I am not hostile to what the distinguished Senator from Louisiana is trying to do. I simply do not know enough about it to make that decision today on the floor. 
   Before I could get to the point of making a decision on it in the Banking Committee, we would have to meet with a lot of different people, a lot of different competing technologies. We would have to meet with NASA. We would have to analyze this in detail. We would have to do our due diligence. We would have to hold public hearings. We would have to go through a markup in the Banking Committee to try to refine it, as we have the bill that is now before us. We are just a long way from that. 
   I am sorry I am not in a position of being able to support the Senator from Louisiana. As of today, I am not. 
   Mr. President, I withdraw amendment No. 2897. That will pull down my amendment and pull down the Johnson amendment with it.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as I said before, I have some sympathy for the Senator from Louisiana. I think this is obviously a very real issue to be considered. But the bottom line is we are on the floor with a bill that has been a year in the making having to do with our goal of trying to see that everybody who lives in rural Texas or rural America has access to their local news and local weather and to the local television station. 
   You could write volumes about what we don't know about this subject, even though we have worked on it for a year, even though we have had extensive hearings, even though we have had innumerable private meetings, and even though we have gone through a markup in committee where we have  debated it at some length and reached some consensus on it--not total consensus. 
   The problem with the Breaux amendment is that this is an area, while it is obviously of importance in terms of one potential technology that might be used in the bill--and that is a satellite--we in our bill are not setting out technology as such. We are letting the marketplace decide that. The point is we have had no hearings. We have heard from no one. We have not discussed, analyzed, or studied this in any detail. We are not ready to make a decision on this today. 
   Under the unanimous consent agreement entered into on November 18, no amendment is in order which is not deemed to be relevant--not relevant to mankind, not relevant to any problem facing us in the future, or any opportunity but relevant specifically to the bill that is pending before the Senate. 
   I make a point of order that the amendment offered by Senator BREAUX is not relevant.

   Mr. GRAMM. We just received a copy of the amendment Senator JOHNSON and I worked out. While he is reviewing it, let me make my concluding remarks. 
   We had a very difficult mandate, to take a bill from last year and make it possible for people living in rural America to get their local television station so they can receive local news, the local weather, the local football game, all of which are critical to life in this great country that we know as the United States of America. 
   The problem from last year is that, with the confluence of interests that would be affected, they put together a bill that was 100 percent loan guarantee, that did not have an effective way of protecting the taxpayer. Therefore, the scoring by the Congressional Budget Office was a potential default rate of about 45 percent. 
   On a bipartisan basis, we have now put together an alternative. We have a loan board made up of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Agriculture, or their Senate-confirmed designees. We guarantee only 80 percent of the loan. We have an expanded ability to go behind shell corporations to get to real assets. 
   We have put together a bill aimed at protecting the taxpayer. It is a risky business trying to come up with the technology and investing $1 billion to get local television stations to rural America. A lot of things can go wrong. This is a dangerous business we have undertaken. 
   Given that the Senate and the House of Representatives, by overwhelming numbers, decided this was something that needed to be done, we committed in the Banking Committee to try to do right. We said that the Committee would report a bill by the end of this month. In fact, we passed a bill unanimously in our Committee a month ago. I believe we have done as good a job as possible given the mandate we had and given the interest of the people who are both on the Committee and serve in the Senate. 
   I am proud of this bill, and now we have to go to conference. They have divided jurisdiction in the House, and it will be a difficult conference. 
   My goal is to stay true to two principles: No. 1, we want to enhance the chance that people who live in rural America, especially in isolated areas, can get their local television signal. Second, we want to be good stewards of the taxpayers' money. We want to guarantee to the best of our ability not only that the loans will be made but that they will be paid back. It does no good to make bad loans, because bad loans don't produce local TV signals. Bad loans simply cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of dollars and do no good. 
   I thank Senator JOHNSON who has been a leader on this. I thank CONRAD BURNS. More than anybody else, CONRAD BURNS is responsible for this bill passing the Senate today. He had the idea, he put together a proposal, and he worked with Members to put together a better proposal. He has been the constant driving force for this to happen. 
   When ABC Saturday football comes on with the local football team, I hope people will think about CONRAD BURNS and the leadership he provided in making it possible for them to view these shows. 
   We will dispense with this amendment by a voice vote. Anyone who wants to make a last-minute statement on this bill, please come to the floor. We are very close to a vote on final passage. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. The Senator is correct. Public involvement must be an essential part of this program if it is to succeed. The Board established by S. 2097 falls within the definition of an ``agency'' under section 552 of Title 5 of the United States Code (Administrative Procedure Act) and therefore will have its rulemaking subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. All parties will have an opportunity to be heard. This openness to public comment will help ensure that the interests of those most likely to benefit from the loan guarantee program--television subscribers in unserved areas--will be represented. In addition, an open rulemaking should help ensure that no applicant for a loan guarantee will receive consideration apart from the merits of the proposed project.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me give a word of explanation. First of all, let me make it clear that it is my intention as a person who has concurrence in this decision not to bring the bill back up through this procedure, nor will I support it being done unless there is an agreement among the parties. Obviously, I would have a right to file cloture on the motion to proceed at some point. 
   Let me explain what has happened. We have for the last 3 weeks been trying to work out concerns about a very tough, very important, and very complicated bill. America has two competing interests. On the one hand, we want to produce and export items that embody high technology because that is the fastest growing industry in the world. We are the world leader in the high-tech industry, and it creates the best paying jobs in America. 
   We have that as one objective. On the other hand, we want to prevent technology that has defense and security implications from falling into the hands of those who might use that technology against the United States of America and our interests. Between these two interests, there is competition and friction. These are very complicated and very tough issues. 
   In the last 3 weeks, roughly half a dozen Members of the Senate have been  working to bring to the floor and pass a bill that passed the Banking Committee 20-0 and that would do something we have not done since 1990: to set in place a new permanent law to protect America's access to the high-tech world market and at the same time protect our national security. 
   We thought yesterday that we had reached an agreement in principle that would allow us to bring the bill to the floor. The problem with reaching agreements in principle is that, as one of my famous constituents once said, the devil is in the details. We found ourselves today thinking we had such an agreement but having great difficulty getting the language to comport to what each individual felt the principle to be. Under those circumstances, I thought good faith required that the bill be pulled down. So we pulled the bill down, and it will not come up under this consent agreement unless an agreement is worked out among the parties that were engaged in this negotiation. 
   I think we all agree that no one acted in bad faith, but what happened was, on a very complicated and very important matter, agreeing in principle is not agreeing to the details. 
   We are hopeful that in the next few days we might still work out these details. If we do, then we will go to this unanimous consent agreement and bring the bill back up. If we don't work out those differences, we will not. 
   Before I yield the floor, because I know the distinguished Senator of the Foreign Relations Committee wants to take the floor, I will make a general point. 
   We started dealing in export control in 1917 with the Trading With the Enemy Act. We then had the Neutrality Act in 1935, and, with the beginning of the cold war, the Export Control Act became law in 1949. We were in a life and death struggle with the Soviet Union. There was an ``evil empire.'' There was a cold war. We won the cold war, and export control on a multilateral basis played a key role in that victory. 
   In those days, two things existed which no longer exist. One was that the United States had a virtual monopoly in high technology. Indeed, we were the world's undisputed leader in technology. Virtually, every area in the world had been decimated by World War II, and we stood supreme. So technology was an American monopoly. 
   Second, in 1949, most of the new technology was driven by defense research. 
   Our legitimate concern, life and death struggle concern, was that this defense research embodied in American industry would end up leaking abroad where it could threaten American national security. 
   By 1990, our consensus had started to fade on the Export Administration Act, and while for two brief periods--from March 1993 through June 1994, and from July 1994 to August 1994--we had temporary solutions, since 1990 we have had no permanent law to protect American national security. 
   Today, the world is very different. We have won the cold war. Today, technology is driven by private industry. Today, it is not defense labs that are generating the new technology that drives American business, it is American industry. 
   We had set out in our export law the number of MTOPS, millions of theoretical operations per second, that a restricted computer could employ, thinking we were protecting what we then called supercomputers. Now, any schoolchild with a computer has the technical capacity, or can get it, and exceed that limit. The number of MTOPS is doubling every 6 months. 
   So we were faced with a decisive question: Can we pass a law and control this technology? We could pass a law and stop it in the United States, but it would occur elsewhere in the world. 
   What we ultimately have to decide is: Is our security tied to our being the leader in technology, or is it tied to our ability to hold on to the technology we have and not share it with anybody? 
   I believe in the end that American security is tied to our leadership in technology. I believe that we have put together a good bill. There is a debate about the details, and there are legitimate differences. As Thomas Jefferson once said: Good men with the same facts are prone to disagree. I have seen nothing in my political career or personal life to convince me that Jefferson was wrong about much of anything, but he was certainly not wrong about this. 
   We have put together a bill that we believe meets national security concerns. But trying to deal with concerns about Presidential powers and waivers is extremely complicated. Yesterday we reached an agreement in principle. There was the nucleus of the agreement, but getting to the details this morning proved more difficult than we anticipated. To be absolutely certain that everyone's rights are preserved, and to be certain we are dealing in good faith, I concluded--and all of the members of the negotiation agreed--that the bill should be pulled down. As a result, I pulled it down. 
   I am hopeful that perhaps as early as tomorrow these differences can be worked out. I don't know whether they can or they can't. I believe America would be richer, freer, happier, and more secure if they could. If they are not worked out, it won't be because I didn't make the effort. I want it to be worked out. I hope it can be. Whether it can be or it can't be, I want to be certain that we are dealing in good faith and that we are dealing with each other on that basis. 
   I think we have preserved that here today. I appreciate my colleagues' help. Someone could have done mischief by objecting; my preference was to go back to the status quo, but we couldn't do that. We have achieved the same result with this agreement, and I thank my colleagues for agreeing to it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I am proud to join in the introduction of legislation which will increase the number of H-1B temporary work visas used to recruit and hire workers with very specialized skills, particularly in high technology fields. This bill will ensure that the dramatic U.S. economic expansion will not be stalled by a lack of skilled workers in critical positions. It retains the language of current law which protects qualified U.S. workers from being displaced by H-1B visa holders. 
   With record low unemployment, U.S. companies already have been forced to slow their expansion or even to cancel projects, and some may be forced to move their operations overseas because of an inability to find qualified individuals to fill job vacancies. We will achieve our full economic potential only if we ensure that high-technology companies can find and hire the people whose unique qualifications and skills are critical to America's future. 
   Last year, the Congress temporarily increased the number of annual H-1B visas from 65,000 to 115,000 for Fiscal Years 1999 and 2000, and to 107,500 in 2001. The number of H-1B visas is scheduled to drop back to 65,000 for Fiscal Year 2002 and subsequent years. Our legislation will increase the H-1B visa cap to 195,000 for Fiscal Years 2000, 2001, and 2002. By the end of that period, we will have the data we need to make an informed decision on the number of such visas required beyond 2002. 
   According to a recent study by the American Electronics Association (AEA), Texas has the fastest growing  high technology industry in the country and is second only to California in the number of high technology workers. This legislation would ensure that these companies have access to highly educated workers, in order that America can continue to grow and prosper, and in doing so, create more jobs and opportunity for U.S. workers. 
   I believe that this legislation represents a fair and effective way to address a critical need in our Nation's economy, and I hope my colleagues will quickly approve this important proposal.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have an unusual time agreement where we have 4 hours 50 minutes. I have asked, as chairman of the committee, to have 45 minutes under my control to make the case for Chairman Greenspan, the President's nominee. 
   I have a very small number of people who wish to speak. Senator SARBANES, as ranking member, has made a similar request for 45 minutes. I think the normal procedure would be to run off time proportionately among those who have asked for time. But since Senator SARBANES and I have such a small amount of time, and many other Members who aren't members of the committee have more time reserved than we do, I would like to begin, so that there will be no dispute, no misunderstanding, by asking unanimous consent that the time be charged proportionately to the two sides. The minority side has 4 hours 5 minutes. The majority side has 45 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged proportionately.

   With that, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank Senator HARKIN. It is my understanding that since the distinguished Senator from Missouri wanted to speak only 3 or so minutes, that he had agreed that after I speak--and I should speak only 5 or 10 minutes--the Senator 
   from Missouri could speak 3 or 4 minutes before Senator HARKIN takes the floor. I think he has an hour. I thank him for that. 
   I hope people are watching this debate. Our dear colleague from North Dakota does an excellent job of presenting his point of view. It is not a point of view I agree with, but it is a point of view that obviously he believes and he presents very effectively, as does Senator HARKIN. 
   For people who believe that there are no differences among Members, that parties don't make any difference, that Democrats and Republicans are identical, I hope they are listening to this debate because we are getting to the very heart of the fundamental differences that separate us and, in separating us, serve the country. In the process, we have an opportunity to present competing visions. Then every 2 years, on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November, people decide whose vision they want to follow. 
   I think this debate is very informative and very important. I have asked for a fairly short amount of time. I think the minority side has 4 hours 5 minutes. I have asked that our side have 45 minutes because I think our case is a very strong one, and we don't think we have to be repetitive to make it. 
   As I look down the list of Americans who have served as Chairmen of the Board of the Federal Reserve Board, it reads like a Who's Who in economics and banking: Paul Volcker, Arthur Burns, William McChesney Martin. These are Americans who have provided distinguished service to our country. But as I look at the record of Alan Greenspan, I can stand on the floor of the Senate and say, without any fear of contradiction, that Alan Greenspan's record is the finest record that has ever been established by a Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board since we created the Federal Reserve and it began operating in 1913. 
   I go further in saying that whether we are talking about Nicholas Biddle at the Second Bank of the United States or about monetary policy conducted by the Treasury or about any central banker in any monetary center anywhere on the planet, I believe a strong case can be made that Alan Greenspan is the greatest central banker in the history of the world. 
   Why do I say these things? Let the record speak for itself in terms of what has happened under Alan Greenspan's leadership. First, how many people have been appointed to the highest appointed position in the land by Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and Bill Clinton? Is there any other person who has been appointed to a high position of public trust by those three men? The answer is no. And why have three successive Administrations appointed Alan Greenspan to be Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board? Because he is the best central banker we have ever had. 
   As we all debate this issue and have our opportunity to second-guess Alan Greenspan, let me talk about the record. The day Alan Greenspan became Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board in 1987, long-term interest rates were 8.98 percent. Today they are 6.42 percent. As a result, millions of Americans who did not have the opportunity to build and buy their own homes the day Alan Greenspan became Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, now have that opportunity, and they are seizing it in record numbers. 
   The day Alan Greenspan became Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 1,938.83. Today the Dow stands at over 11,000. In other words, the equity value of the broad cross-section measure of the fundamental industry in America has risen during the period that Alan Greenspan has been Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board by nearly 500 percent. 
   Today, schoolteachers, firemen, insurance salesmen, and coaches find that the value of their 401(k)s and their IRAs have skyrocketed, and as a result, their financial security has grown. They approach retirement in a better position than anyone could have ever expected. And that wealth is widely distributed. More Americans own part of the equity value of America than ever before in history. Indeed, we have come the closest of any society in history of fulfilling the Marxist dream of workers owning the means of production--only we have done it the real  way, not with the government stealing it and claiming that workers own it; workers really do own it. 
   The unemployment rate the day Alan Greenspan became Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board stood at 5.7 percent. Today, it is 4.1 percent--the lowest level in 30 years. In fact, when you look at the array of social programs in the economy and their impact on the incentive of people to take jobs, when you look at the environment in which that 4.1 percent exists, I doubt if there has ever been a day in American history where the unemployment rate was effectively lower than it is today. The wonderful thing about this growth in employment is that it is not just the same people who are always getting jobs. A Congressman's daughter and the son of the bank president get jobs--good times and bad times. 
   What is wonderful about the golden economic age in which we are living is that employment among minorities is growing faster than employment in the economy as a whole. We have had an explosion in the number of women who have gone into business and succeeded, and the benefits of this economic growth are being more widely shared today than any economic growth that we have ever achieved. 
   The rate of inflation on the day Alan Greenspan became Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board was 4.5 percent, and we were grateful. Today, the inflation rate is just 2.7 percent. As one of our colleagues already noted, if we could account for quality differences, if we could take into account the quality differences in a new Suburban versus a Suburban 10 years ago, or the quality difference in a Sony television as compared to 10 years ago, that inflation rate would be virtually zero. 
   Just as Alan Greenspan was beginning his service as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 1987, we had a stock market drop of 500 points. That was a time when 500 points were real and represented a dramatic drop in equity values. Some argued that the Government had to intervene; too many people are investing in the equity market; we have to have dramatic reforms. But under the stable leadership of Alan Greenspan, and several other members of the Working Group that was put together at that time, we basically set about to strengthen the system in terms of liquidity and transparency, and Government kept its cold, dead hand off the equity market, and we have seen in the 1990s what the result has been. 
   At the end of the 1980s, we experienced the S&L collapse, the greatest financial crisis during my period of service in Congress. It cost $100 billion to fix. It could have been avoided had we put up money earlier and acted earlier, as President Reagan urged. But under the leadership of Alan Greenspan, while nobody knew it at the time, we instituted a procedure of closing troubled thrifts and selling off assets, which the whole world looks at as the standard of how you deal with a financial crisis. 
   Have we forgotten the Mexican peso crisis? Have we forgotten the Asian economic crisis? Can you remember when it was conventional wisdom that the collapse in Asia was going to mean an economic downturn in America? I missed that downturn, and so did America. Under Alan Greenspan's leadership, we have set a course that helped Asia regain its footing. Korea, through reforms, has done it. Other countries will achieve greater stability when they 
   reform. Have we forgotten the Russian economic collapse? Have we forgotten the Brazilian currency collapse? 
   In other words, Alan Greenspan's stewardship as chairman has not been uneventful. But the net result is that the American economy has stayed on track. It is easy for us to second-guess the policies of the Federal Reserve Board, but who thought Alan Greenspan would raise interest rates on the very day that we are considering his confirmation? If that is not a statement of confidence in him, I don't know what is, and I don't see any reason to be second-guessing Alan Greenspan's record. 
   If I have a concern today as we move toward this vote, it is what are we going to do when Alan Greenspan is gone. I hope there is someone out there who will be capable of matching this record. But I am not sure there is such a person, and it worries me. My grandmother used to say, ``The graveyard is full of indispensable men.'' Alan Greenspan is not going to have this job forever. But as long as he wants it, and I have a vote about whether he is going to get it, based on this record, I am going to vote to give him the opportunity to continue to serve. 
   Let me conclude with a final remark, and then I will turn it over to my colleague. Our founders were afraid of men on white horses. They tried to write a system so that it didn't make any difference how elections turned out. They tried to make it so that it didn't matter who was appointed to various positions because they knew that people were fallible. They tried to write a system that was relatively infallible. And so when someone achieves a record like this, while you can't give Alan Greenspan all the credit--I think a lot of the credit goes back to Ronald Reagan and the reforms that we undertook then, and I am willing to give some credit to Bill Clinton and some to Congress. But if you were going to pick anybody who is currently holding a position of public trust and ask who has had more to do with the success we have had in this last decade--the last 12 years, really--of unparalleled economic achievement, I think you would have to give the prize to Alan Greenspan. 
   So there are two sides to the story. I hope people will listen to these arguments. This is serious business when you are talking about the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board. I hope they will listen to these arguments and that they will see that there are differences among Members, differences between the two parties. As long as there are people like Alan Greenspan who are willing to serve, I think America is in good shape. I am eager to see him have the opportunity to serve for another 4 years. I hope he is blessed with health that will allow him to continue in this job for a very long period of time. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today the Senate is taking up for its consideration H.R. 1094, a bill to amend the Federal Reserve Act to broaden the range of discount window loans which may be used as collateral for Federal Reserve notes. This legislation will expand the field of assets that the Federal Reserve may use to collateralize Federal Reserve notes. All currency in circulation must be backed by specific assets, but much of the collateral that the Federal Reserve accepts for discount window loans is ineligible under current law for use to back the currency. The changes put in place by this legislation will allow the Federal Reserve to apply all eligible discount loan assets to collateralize the currency. 
   This legislation poses some risks unless adequate safeguards are in place. The Federal Reserve applies a discount to each type of asset used as collateral. Broadening the scope of eligible assets makes it even more imperative that strict and aggressive discounting be applied to any assets used to back U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve should discount aggressively these assets through an objective and clearly defined process that leaves no room for doubt that our currency is fully backed by reliable assets. At the most basic level, when valuing these assets this should be our general rule: when in doubt, discount. 
   Failure to discount collateral assets aggressively would do more than threaten the safety and soundness of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet; it would threaten the U.S. economy and all economies that rely on a stable dollar. Many countries around the world recently have learned a painful lesson on the value of a sound currency. 
   We must remember that any country can engage in monetary mismanagement, and most have at some point in time. The United States must avoid that path. With a currency that is considered a stable medium by U.S. citizens and a store of value by both domestic and foreign investors, the Federal Reserve must hold sound money paramount as it implements this important change in currency collateral requirements. It has taken nearly two decades to rebuild the reputation of the dollar after the inflation of the Carter years. Today, ``sound as a dollar'' has meaning here and all over the world. We must do nothing to undermine it.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 3373, the Leif Ericson Millennium Commemorative Coin Act. This bill authorizes three separate commemorative coin programs which will commemorate the following historic events: the millennial anniversary of Leif Ericson's discovery of the New World, the bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition, and the bicentennial of the first meeting of the United States Congress in the Capitol building after moving to Washington, D.C. 
   Companion bills for each of the three coin programs included in H.R. 3373 have also been introduced separately in the Senate. All three of the free-standing bills, S.1710, S. 1187, and S. 1468, have satisfied the rules of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on commemorative coin legislation, including having obtained a minimum of sixty-seven Senate cosponsors. The effort to combine the three bills and pass them as one coin package has been worked out by the House and Senate Banking Committees, and this bill was subsequently introduced and passed by the House of Representatives. 
   Mr. President, this legislation has the support of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs as it fully meets the standards set forth by the committee and furthermore, each bill adheres to the commemorative coin reforms enacted in the 104th Congress. Those reforms were necessary to keeping the time-honored pasttime of coin collecting from becoming overrun with far too many coin programs commemorating events or figures of lesser national recognition. I look forward to swift enactment of this legislation.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what we have before us is not the answer to our prayers, but it is what we call in politics ``consensus.'' 
   Margaret Thatcher said of consensus:  
   To me, consensus seems to be the process of abandoning all beliefs, principles, values, and policies in search of something in which no one believes.  
   Well, I would like to say to our dear colleagues, Senator KOHL and Senator GRAMS, that I do not support dairy compacts. There are two sides to every issue, and I know we have people on both sides. In this case, however, at least in my mind, there is a right side and a wrong side. Dairy compacts would make a Soviet commissar blush. The idea of allowing a regional group of producers to conspire, with Government support, and set prices is an absolute outrage. We ought to be ashamed of it, especially having passed Freedom to Farm. 
   I share the outrage of my two colleagues. I just want to say to Rod GRAMS and Herb KOHL, on this issue, not only did they fight for their States but for every consumer across this country. Senator BYRD, if the great general had been from Wisconsin it would have been a much shorter war, from a historians point of view, and that would have meant a much better outcome from a humanitarian's point of view. In any case, we have had people here who stood up and fought for what they believed in, what was right for their States. In this body we still honor those people. I commend both Senator KOHL and Senator GRAMS.

   Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator. As you know, we agreed on language that would permit the U.S. to support mobilization of the amount of IMF gold necessary to provide a stream of interest earnings sufficient for IMF participation in the HIPC initiative. However, we agreed that only \9/14\ of the interest earnings could be used for HIPC debt relief, until such time as Congress authorized the U.S. to vote in favor of using the remaining \5/14\ of the earnings as well. I committed to the Administration that the Banking Committee would act on this remaining IMF authorization no later than May 1, 2000. It is my hope, of course, that the Foreign Relations Committee could act with similar dispatch.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is easy when you come to work every day in the most historic and important building in the world to forget you are part of history--to forget you are in a sacred place where history has been made in the past. But it is even easier to forget you are making history now. 
   But I am reminded that we are making history now when I listen to Senator BYRD speak with righteousness on behalf of the working people of West Virginia. And might I also say, I have never heard a more eloquent speech in the Senate than Senator CRAIG's speech that he gave earlier. 
   Having heard those speeches--including Senator MCCONNELL's and Senator ROCKEFELLER's--I do not want to rise to talk about the substance. I do not think you can improve on what they had to say. But there is an important point, at least in my mind, that I want to make; and that is, something is wrong in America. Something is out of balance in America. 
   If tomorrow in West Virginia a sub-species of crickets develop that have legs 6 millimeters longer than crickets as we know them, or that have brown or white specks on them, they would be protected before the law. They would be protected by the Endangered Species Act. There would literally be thousands of people who would be willing to troop to West Virginia and hold signs and demand that this new sub-species of crickets be protected. 
   But yet when the livelihood of people who hear that alarm ring at 4:30 a.m. in the morning--and if you grew up in one of those houses--I know Senator BYRD did--the next sound you would hear is those two feet hitting the floor. It is predictable. You know what is going to happen, whether it is raining or whether it is not raining. These are people who get up every day, who work hard, who struggle to make ends meet, who sit down around the kitchen table on the first day of the month and get out that stub they got with their paycheck. Then they take the back of an envelope, or a piece of paper, and they try to figure out how they are going to be able to pay their bills, and who they can get by without paying this month. They contribute to America by producing things America needs. 
   I think something is out of kilter in America when our laws are more focused on protecting sub-species of crickets than they are focused on protecting people who earn a living with the sweat of their brow and with their hands. 
   I think something is very wrong in America when there does not seem to be much focus on working men and women. And what was moving to me about Senator BYRD's speech is he was speaking on behalf of the people who work with their hands, and who work for a living, and who often do not have much of a voice in American Government. 
   I am not here to criticize people who have focused, in some cases, their lives, their civic activity, and their leisure time activity on the environment. But I think something is wrong when, in focusing on the environment, we forget about people who work for a living and are affected. 
   I think, in some cases, environmentalism has gone too far. I think, in some cases, that it has become anti-growth. Maybe that makes sense if you live in a fancy air-conditioned house and if your children have gone to college. If you have boundless opportunities, it makes sense to say we need to protect the environment at all costs and that there is no burden that is too great to bear. After all, the person saying that already has a piece of the American pie and has already generally lived the American dream. 
   But I think what Senator BYRD has reminded us of is that not every American has lived the American dream. Not every American has gotten a piece of the pie. 
   I think when we have focused so much on a sub-species of crickets, it is about time that people in the Senate stand up and say: What about people who make a living in the mining industries of this country--people who have had placed on their livelihood less weight by American law than we place on the assumed well-being of subspecies of crickets? I think something is out of balance in America. I think we need to bring it back into balance. I think we need to remind people who are so concerned about one particular element of the environment that there is no more basic part of the environment than the ability of the people in West Virginia, or Kentucky, or Texas, or any other State in the Union to make their house payment, or their ability to earn a livelihood, or their ability to have self-respect in their own worth of what they do. 
   We are not talking about tearing down America's environmental laws. No country in history has a better environment than we have. No country has spent more resources and legitimate effort on their environment than we have.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. This has obviously been a very difficult issue. We passed the satellite bill in the Senate unanimously. I think every Member of the Senate realizes the ability to receive television signals in America is critically important. On Saturday, you want to watch Texas A&M. On Sunday, you want to watch the Dallas Cowboys. And one's life is diminished if you cannot do either one of those things. 
   The problem we had was we passed a bill in the Senate to set up the legal structure to get that job done. They passed a bill in the House to do the same. Neither bill had any loan guarantee language in it. The conferees realized there was a problem, but in their haste to get it done, it is my opinion that we ended up with language that was as good as anybody could have written during that short period of time. 
   Under the agreement we have reached, we have an opportunity to have representatives of the television stations, the satellite companies, and potential Internet suppliers come in. We have the ability to look at the technology. 
   We have the ability to look at loan guarantees we have given in the past. We have the ability to get the input of the Treasury. Hopefully, we will have the ability to put together a bill that will maximize the chances that every American will have access to their local television station. 
   I want my colleagues to know, as I have said many times as this debate has evolved, I intend, by the 30th of March, to report a bill from the Banking Committee. It is my goal not only to write a bill that will deal with this problem, but I hope we can develop a prototype for the future, where we recognize that there are some social goals that are not necessarily met by market forces, and that the market by itself might not provide this service which we have deemed to be important. 
   The question then is: What can you do to provide this service at the lowest possible cost and in the most efficient manner? It is my goal to put together a bill that will achieve that goal and perhaps be a prototype for similar problems in the future. 
   So I thank my colleagues. Probably as much effort has gone into this one little issue as anything throughout this whole process. It is an important issue. It involved an important principle. I think we have reached a good conclusion. I am happy about it. I believe, when we complete it, that every Member of the Senate and every Member of Congress and, hopefully, everybody who has a satellite dish or wants one will be happy about it as well. 
   I thank my colleagues.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what we have before us this afternoon is a perfect example of what can happen when a bankruptcy bill is on the floor, and Members are offering amendments that have nothing to do with bankruptcy law but everything to do with banking. 
   We have two amendments before us, and I have a short period of time, so I'll make my points briefly. 
   The amendment offered by Senator DURBIN basically attempts to enforce the truth-in-lending law--which has many remedies under current banking law, including damages, including class action suits--through a new mechanism, the bankruptcy courts.  
   What is the practical import of all this, and why is this opposed by virtually everybody who is involved in mortgage lending? 
   Basically, it is a violation of truth in lending to lend money to someone who is not capable of paying it back. So, if we change the law--if we change permanent banking law as part of this bankruptcy bill--to say that if a borrower can prove that someone violated the Truth in Lending Act, then he doesn't have to pay back his mortgage loan when he's in bankruptcy, what is going to happen? 
   What is going to happen is that everybody in bankruptcy who has a mortgage loan is going to file a lawsuit claiming, Well, obviously, I am bankrupt, so the lender should have known I could not pay this loan back; therefore, under the Durbin amendment, I should not have to pay it back. 
   This is an absurd amendment that would undercut truth in lending, which has more enforcement powers than most other lending laws in America, by literally creating a situation where every deadbeat would file a lawsuit saying: I have gone bankrupt because I have spent my money. I have not paid my bills, and because I have gone bankrupt, it is the bank's fault; therefore, I should be able to default on my mortgage. Which would mean that every honest person in America who pays their bills, who sacrifices and saves their money and pays off their mortgage, will end up paying a higher rate of interest. 
   So I hope our colleagues will roundly defeat this amendment. It has absolutely nothing to do with bankruptcy law, and everything to do with banking law, and it should not even be considered. 
   The second amendment I want to mention is paternalism at its worst, and that is the amendment of my dear friend, Senator DODD, which would require students between the ages of 18 and 21 to get parental consent in order to be issued a credit card. 
   I want to remind my colleagues that college students who are 18 and older are adults under Federal law for purposes of credit. This amendment would therefore be a violation of the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, which prohibits the use of age on a discriminatory basis against anyone over 18 years of age. 
   The second point I want to make is that this concern about the danger of students having credit cards is based on a myth. Fifty-nine percent of all college students in America pay their balance in full at the end of the month. But only 40 percent of the general population pays their balance in full. Eighty-six percent of students pay their credit cards with their own money, not with their parents' money. The plain truth is that college students are better credit card risks than the general population. It is obvious that if you are dealing with people who are highly motivated, highly disciplined, successful college students, you want them to become your customer because they are going to go out and make a lot of money and become very profitable customers. The idea that we would be engaged in this sort of paternalism, which would require every student in America, even though it is against the law for the bank to discriminate against them if they are over 18--

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the idea that we in the U.S. Congress are going to pass a law that takes adults, under our Federal credit statutes, and force them to go back to their parents in order to get a credit card, when the credit behavior of students is superior to the general population, is simply an outrage. Our Democrat colleagues cannot get it right. When we debated the banking bill, they were concerned that banks wouldn't lend money to people who are needy. But when we are debating the bankruptcy bill, it is the bank's fault for lending too much money to people who are needy. They can't quite get it straight. I guess it varies depending on which bill are considering. Both of these amendments should be roundly defeated.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have a truth-in-lending law. It is vigorously enforced with many remedies, including damages in class action lawsuits. 
   Senator DURBIN's amendment would make bankruptcy courts, which have no jurisdiction over truth in lending whatsoever, an enforcement mechanism of the truth-in-lending law. This produces an absurd situation. Under truth in lending, the lender has an obligation to make some assessment about the borrower's ability to pay. Under this amendment, everyone who is in default or in bankruptcy will be able to argue that the bank should have known that the lender could not pay the loan back and therefore the mortgage should be forgiven. 
   The net result is that hard-working, frugal people who save money and pay their debts would end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars, in additional interest costs to cover people who would file lawsuits claiming, ``Well, I went broke and it's the bank's fault, and therefore I shouldn't have to pay my mortgage.'' 
   This amendment should be defeated. Giving one court, which has no jurisdiction over the pertinent law, the ability to enforce that law, which rightly belongs in another court, is, I think, a gross violation of logic and the basic structure of the legal system. This is a bad amendment that will produce an even worse situation where honest people who pay their debts will end up paying higher interest rates for people who don't pay their debts. 
   I move to table the Durbin amendment.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, one of the provisions of the bill before the Senate today would ``amend the Federal Reserve Act to broaden the range of discount window loans which may be used as collateral for Federal Reserve notes.'' This legislation was considered by the House Banking Committee and has been referred to the Senate Banking Committee. It is now being offered as an amendment to the bankruptcy bill to expedite its enactment prior to the adjournment of the Congress. 
   The currency collateral legislation would expand the field of assets that the Federal Reserve may use to collateralize Federal Reserve notes. All currency in circulation must be backed by specific assets, but much of the collateral that the Federal Reserve accepts for discount window loans is ineligible under current law for use to back the currency. The changes put in place by this legislation will allow the Federal Reserve to apply all eligible discount loan assets to collateralize the currency. 
   This legislation poses some risks unless adequate safeguards are in place. The Federal Reserve applies a discount to each type of asset used as collateral. Broadening the scope of eligible assets makes it even more imperative that strict and aggressive discounting be applied to any assets used to back U.S. currency. The Federal Reserve should discount aggressively these assets through an objective and clearly defined process that leaves no room for doubt that our currency is fully backed by reliable assets. At the most basic level, when valuing these assets this should be our general rule: when in doubt, discount. 
   Failure to discount collateral assets aggressively would do more than threaten the safety and soundness of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet; it would threaten the U.S. economy and all economies that rely on a stable dollar. Many countries around the world recently have learned a painful lesson on the value of a sound currency. 
   We must remember that any country can engage in monetary mismanagement, and most have at some point in time. The United States must avoid that path. With a currency that is considered a stable medium by U.S. citizens and a store of value by both domestic and foreign investors, the Federal Reserve must hold sound money paramount as it implements this important change in currency collateral requirements. It has taken nearly two decades to rebuild the reputation of the dollar after the inflation of the Carter years. Today, ``sound as a dollar'' has meaning here and all over the world. We must do nothing to undermine it.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a moment about another subject. I do not want to interfere with this important debate, but I think the subject I want to speak about is important in its own right. I want to put my colleagues and the public on notice about what is happening. 
   Probably we have all received more telephone calls and more letters on the so-called Satellite Home Viewer Act than any issue we have dealt with in this Congress. This is an issue that flows from the fact that people who have satellite dishes, especially people who live in the country, want to have access to their nearest television station. It is something we all understand. For those of us who live in the country, it is something we want. 
   The House of Representatives adopted a very good bill that would allow negotiations between satellites and local television stations with a goal of bringing the local television station into every living room and den in America. This would be a great boon to people who have satellite dishes in rural areas. 
   That bill was adopted in the House 422 to 1 on April 27. On May 20, the Senate unanimously adopted a similar bill. These bills are very strongly supported. We are all getting hundreds of telephone calls in support of them. They do what each caller wants, and that is make it possible for people, especially in rural areas, who have satellite dishes to get the news and the weather from the local station, however far away that may be. 
   The problem is, for some unexplainable reason--at least unexplainable to logic--in the conference, rather than adopting the House bill or the Senate bill or something in between, the conferees apparently decided that not every problem in the world was solved, and therefore in an effort to try to solve problems which were not part of either bill, they decided to put the American taxpayer on the hook for a $1.25 billion loan guarantee. 
   I want to make it clear. This loan guarantee was not part of the Senate bill for which we voted unanimously. It was not part of the House bill that passed 422 to 1. It was produced out of whole cloth in conference when the basic idea was there are additional problems that might be dealt with, so as a result, we want to simply add $1.25 billion. 
   When you approach the people who added it, you get the idea this is somehow for small business. But when you read their bill, one of the loans can be as large as $625 million. The two obvious beneficiaries are two companies, one of which saw its equity value go up 4 1/2 times the rate of the growth of the Dow Industrial Index over the last 12 months; the other one saw its equity value go up 49 times as fast as Dow did in the last 12 months. 
   You might wonder why these two extraordinarily successful businesses with an explosion in their equity value, as measured by the value of common stock, suddenly need the taxpayer to come forth and sign a loan guarantee of $1.25 billion to get to the bottom line. I am for the satellite bill. I voted for it in the Senate. I would like to see it passed. I think it is an important piece of legislation. But I am adamantly opposed to Members of the House and the Senate simply deciding to put the taxpayer on the hook for $1.25 billion, with a provision that was in neither the House bill or Senate bill, a provision that cannot be justified by any logic whatsoever. 
   I want to make it clear if that bill comes to the floor of the Senate and it has that loan guarantee in there obligating the American taxpayer for $1.25 billion, money that was not in the House bill, was not in the Senate bill, I intend to object to its consideration, and it will not become law in this millennium. 
   I cannot speak beyond this thousand years. But I can assure you that under the rules of the Senate, it will not become law before the turn of the new millennium, if then. 
   One of the authors of this provision, referring to me, said: 
   I don't think anybody would want to have the reputation 
   of having cost millions of Americans the loss of their network signal, so I don't anticipate problems on either floor. 
   My response to our colleague in the House is: Anticipate problems on the floor of the Senate. And if anyone is endangering the ability of Americans to get the local television signal, it is not me; it is those who have added a $1.25 billion loan guarantee in this bill. 
   I know there are going to be a lot of people calling my office and others. Here is my message: If you are for the satellite bill, if you want to be able to get your local television station, don't bother calling me. Call the people who want to add to a conference report this $1.25 billion giveaway which was not voted on in either House of Congress, and say to them: Quit trying to give my money away and give me my local television signal. 
   I am not going to let this bill be adopted this year with that $1.25 billion giveaway in it. It is not too late. The conferees can come to their senses and take this provision out. It was not in either bill. It should not have been there to begin with. We can have the satellite bill passed by the end of tomorrow's business. But if it is not taken out, it is not going to be adopted. I wanted to come over and make that clear so everybody would know exactly where we are. If you want this bill, insist the $1.25 billion giveaway be taken out of it. We have the ability and we should make it possible for people in the country to get the adjacent cities' TV stations. I am for that. I am a direct beneficiary of it. Many of the people I care about are.  
   But the idea we are talking about giving away $1.25 billion in loan guarantees to some of the most well-off companies in America as a rider on this bill is the kind of outrageous legislative action that has to be stopped. If they think because the underlying bill is so popular that everybody is just going to turn the other way and let this $1.25 billion giveaway occur, they are wrong. I do not intend to do that. It is not going to pass the Senate unless they take it out. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank Senator BUNNING for his kind comments. I will soon yield to Senator ENZI. I thank him for his leadership, for all he did in helping us put together a good bill to begin with, for the work he did in understanding the bill and what we were trying to achieve. 
   I have always believed that conviction is born of knowledge. It is hard to be committed to something that you don't understand. I think one of the reasons we held together so well in getting this bill through committee and to  the floor--through conference and finally here today, as we reach the goal line--is all of those endless meetings we had in January and February to talk about what it was we wanted to do and why it was important. If there is any person who didn't miss a single one of those meetings, it is MIKE ENZI. MIKE ENZI is a real doer. When you have a hard job to do, you want to give it to him. I like giving him jobs because he always does them. 
   I yield the Senator from Wyoming 10 minutes.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I know it is going to cost me something big, but I am very grateful for it. As I said last night, one of the reasons we were successful, one of the reasons this bill is as good as it is, is that I have had the very strong support of TRENT LOTT and our leadership. Having their support is like having a stone wall to your back in a gun fight: You can still get killed, but nobody is going to shoot you in the back. That has been very beneficial. TRENT LOTT's willingness to say we are going to follow this path, whether it leads us to success or failure, is really what has led us to success. 
   I appreciate those kind comments and yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the understanding of the Senator from Connecticut is correct. In addition, it should be noted that in some instances, no rule-writing is required. For example, new section 4(k)(4) of the Bank Holding Company Act, as added by section 103 of the bill, explicitly authorizes bank holding companies which file the necessary certifications to engage in a laundry list of financial activities. These activities are permissible upon the effective date of the act without further action by the regulators. The conferees recognize, however, that refinements in rulemaking may be necessary and desirable going forward, and for example, have specifically authorized the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to jointly issue rules on merchant banking activities. If regulators determine that any such rulemaking is necessary, the conferees encourage them to act expeditiously.

The intent of section 502 is to assure that consumers receive clear and conspicuous notice of a financial institutions' privacy policies and practices, and to assure that consumers can direct that their non-public information not be disclosed to third parties. So long as consumers receive a notice that gives them a clear choice about whether or not that non-public personal information can be transferred to non-affiliated third parties, the opt-out choice need not be provided separately for each disclosure of such information.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me agree with my ranking member to say that we have waited 40 years for this bill. We are not waiting any longer than 3:30. If someone wants to get over here and speak, they had better do it. It is always a little bit risky to try to sum up on a bill such as this that has been in the making for 40 years, 
   a bill that overturns a piece of legislation that Franklin Roosevelt said was the most important bill ever passed by an American Congress. 
   Having listened to the debate, I have a few points in conclusion. First, there is often such a difference between reality and perception. I listened to some of my colleagues, especially those who oppose the bill, talk about special interests and what this special interest or that special interest got in this bill. In my period of service in Congress, I have never participated in the writing of a bill with less special interests involved than this bill. When Republicans on the committee started in January a series of meetings to talk about why we wanted to modernize the financial laws of the country, why we wanted to repeal Glass-Steagall, why we wanted to restructure the economy in terms of benefit, we set out a theory of financial services modernization and we set out a plan to try to achieve it. 
   As I listened to all the talk about special interests, I remember Texas bankers and Texas insurance agents both sending a letter which arrived on the same day telling my constituents I had betrayed their particular interests to the other. The insurance agents sent out a letter saying I had sold out to the bankers; the bankers sent out a letter saying I had sold out to the insurance agents. 
   The bottom line is nobody was sold out in this bill. We started a negotiation to try to deal with a legitimate concern. The concern was this: If someone is going to a bank for a loan, should that bank, while they are in the process of making that loan, have the right to try to sell an individual insurance? We tried to sit down with everybody knowledgeable and come up with a real solution. In the end, I am happy to say, both of these interest groups concluded nobody had sold their interests out and we had put together a good bill. 
   However, there is a simple test on this bill. If anybody wants to set a marker today to determine whether in 20, 40, or 60 years from now we are going to compare this bill to Glass-Steagall, whether this bill is a success, there is a simple test. That test is, Will this bill generate more diverse products for the American consumer? Will those products better meet the needs of the American consumer? And will they be cheaper? If those things don't happen, this bill fails. 
   That is what this bill is about. There is nothing in this bill that sets out to benefit big banks in New York. I don't represent New York. I don't have any huge banks in my State. Long ago, other people bought out the big banks in my State. I have sought in this bill, and I believe the vast majority of all of our Members, have sought to promote the interests of the consumer. 
   This bill is about people who go to work every day and who borrow money on their homes. If someone can improve on their mortgage rate and bring down the interest they pay by even one-quarter of 1 percent, that means thousands of dollars in their pockets over a 30-year period. That is what this bill is about. This bill is about people who want checking accounts and who want services, and they want those services provided on a competitive basis where they are as cheap as can be produced and sold. That is what this bill is about. 
   This bill is about people who want the ability to do their banking, their insurance, their securities, their retirement on a competitive basis. It is about bringing together those forces.  
   We have been living with a system that was established during the Great Depression. I don't think there is any reason now to go back and rehash why it happened. But one can make a strong case that the Depression was produced by a failure of the Federal Reserve. Milton Friedman made that case in the ``Monetary History of the United States'' and won the Nobel prize principally for that work. 
   Congress was frightened. They didn't know what to do. It was 
   an age of demagoguery. Probably the most demagogic statement that has ever been made in American history was made by the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, when during the debate on Glass-Steagall he said:  
   The money changers have fled from the high seats in the temple of our civilization.  
   That statement is reminiscent of statements being made in Central Europe at the same time. 
   Congress didn't know what caused the Depression. They were frightened. They didn't know what to do so they passed a bill that I think one can argue historically was as punitive as it was prescriptive. It was aimed at one man, in some ways--J.P. Morgan--probably the greatest American of the early 20th century. We don't know a lot about him because he never held public office, but he was probably the greatest American of the early part of this century. 
   In this era, we had a bill passed that basically forced an artificial separation of the financial sector of our economy. That bill, despite the fact its author within a year had concluded it was a mistake, has been the law of the land. In fact, Time magazine calls it the defining financial legislation of the 20th century. 
   We came here today to change the defining legislation of the 20th century. We came to bring logic back to the financial sector. We didn't come here today to bring it back to benefit banks or to benefit insurance companies or to benefit securities companies. We came to overturn the most significant financial legislation of the 20th century because it is in the interests of the American consumer that it be overturned. 
   Let me touch on areas that will be much benefited by this that have had no discussion. The first point, one of the biggest problems we have, is the inability of small businesses to raise capital. Probably the most concentrated part of the American financial sector is securities underwriting. 
   If a little business in Mexia or College Station, TX, or Cambridge or Easton, MD, or any other of thousands of small or medium-sized towns across America, has a good idea, they will have a hard time raising capital because it is hard to get Wall Street interested in a small business in a little town unless you have one of the great ideas of the century--and even then it takes a long time to prove it. 
   By letting banks participate in underwriting securities now, every banker in every small town will have the ability to identify a good small business and give them access to capital that has never existed before in the history of this country. That is a benefit which will accrue to literally hundreds of thousands of small businesses over the decades to come as a result of this bill because we will vastly expand the number of securities underwriters, we will make every bank in every city in America a potential underwriter for small business. That is a dramatic and positive change in law. 
   We dominate the world's financial markets, and we have done it with one hand tied behind us, because we have the greatest economic system in the history of the world. 
   But we can untie that hand that we have had tied behind us, and we do it in this bill by repealing Glass-Steagall. This bill is going to make America more competitive on the world market, and that is important because it means thousands of jobs, high-paying jobs--not just on Wall Street in New York City, but for every business and every consumer in America. I believe we are too quick to say something benefits Wall Street instead of Main Street. The reality is, Wall Street is the foundation on which Main Street is built. When America is more competitive, every American benefits. 
   There has been a lot of talk that what we are trying to do is already happening to some degree. And it is because almost immediately after the passage of Glass-Steagall, we had an effort by regulators to begin to bore holes in these walls between insurance and banking, and between securities and banking. We have seen, through regulatory innovation, a successful effort in some areas to get around the law. This has allowed some competition to occur. The problem is, what regulators give, they can take back. So we have created a situation where we have given virtual police power to regulators because they have allowed these innovations to occur and they can take them back at any moment. That creates too much power to be focused in the hands of a very small number of people. 
   We change that by tearing down the walls, and in the process taking that discretionary power away from the regulators so people are guaranteed in law the right to be engaged in these activities. 
   My dear colleague from Maryland mentioned yesterday the issue of ``too big to fail.'' That is a real issue. In this bill we start the process of dealing with the issue of too big to fail. We establish a principle, as part of the compromise that was worked out between Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which is not well understood. It is a complicated kind of issue. But what it does is profoundly important because for the first time in American financial law, we require big banks to have subordinated debt. That is debt that only gets paid once the depositors are paid, the creditors are paid, and everything else is paid off. That subordinated debt is a real live thermometer that is constantly telling us how well this financial institution is. It is constantly telling us how safe and how sound these institutions are. It represents, in my opinion, the beginning of our effort to deal with a very real problem that Senator SARBANES talked about, and that problem is the problem of being too big to fail. We don't let banks do anything within the bank unless they have an incredibly high rating on that subordinated debt; that is, that it be rated AAA, AA, or A. 
   There has been a lot of talk about CRA. The bottom line is we have done several very positive things. First, sunshine is the best disinfectant. How can people be held accountable if we don't know what they have been given money to do, how much money they have been given, and how they spend it. In this legislation, we have set out an ironclad process to guarantee us that information. 
   Second, there is a regulatory burden problem. Small banks end up being heavily burdened by regulations that often have a relatively nominal effect on big banks. We have dealt with that by giving smaller banks some needed regulatory relief. In terms of privacy, we have heard a lot of discussion, but we need to remember two things: No. 1, we require in this bill, in a provision that was adopted in the conference, offered by Members of the Senate conference, a disclosure in detail of what a bank's privacy policies are. That gives consumers the most powerful tool that exists in a free society in protecting privacy, and that is if you do not like the bank's policy, you can take your business somewhere else. 
   Second, we give consumers the power to opt out. 
   So these are important provisions. I thought, as we waited to be sure everyone is here for this vote, that these points needed to be made. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, success is claimed by a thousand parents. And today there are a lot of people who can claim parenthood. I am very happy to have played a part in delivering the bill before the Senate today. 
   I think it represents the American legislative process at its best. It has resulted more from an effort to reach a logical conclusion than to satisfy various special interest groups. In that way, it is not unique but it is different. 
   But the question is not how proud we are of this bill today. The question is, How will it look 50 years from now when it has gone from infancy to maturity? 
   Obviously, after setting out a dramatic change in public policy, it is fair to set out a test for determining its success. How will people judge whether we were successful in passing this bill today? My test is, What are we trying to do in the bill? Are we trying to benefit banks or insurance companies or securities companies, or are we trying to benefit consumers and workers? The test that I believe we should use--the test I will use, the test I hope people looking at this bill years in the future will use--is, Did it produce a greater diversity of products and services for American consumers? Were those products better? And did they sell at a lower price? I think if the answer to those three questions is yes, then this bill will have succeeded. 
   The world changes, and we have to change with it. Abraham Lincoln used to tell the story about how Government had to change all outmoded laws because they did not fit anymore, much as it would be unreasonable to expect a man to wear the same clothes he wore as a boy; that there is a nature to things and to society, and as they change, Government has to change to recognize the new reality. 
   I believe today we are changing financial services in America to reflect that we do have a new century coming and we have an opportunity to dominate that century the way America dominated the last century. 
   Ultimately, the final judge of the bill is history. Ultimately, as you look at  the bill, you have to ask yourself, Will people in the future be trying to repeal it, as we are here today trying to repeal--and hopefully repealing--Glass-Steagall? I think the answer will be no. I think it will be no because we are doing something very different from Glass-Steagall. Glass-Steagall, in the midst of the Great Depression, thought Government was the answer. In this period of economic growth and prosperity, we believe freedom is the answer. 
   This is a deregulatory bill. I believe that is going to be the wave of the future. Although this bill will be changed many times, and changed dramatically as we expand freedom and opportunity, I do not believe it will be repealed. It sets the foundation for the future, and that will be the test. 
   So I am proud to have been part of this. I am proud to have worked with everybody as part of the process. It has been interesting and Government at its best. I think one of the reasons we run for public office is to get a chance to do things such as this. I am glad to have had an opportunity to play a part and urge all of my colleagues to support this dramatic move into the future.

We will have to take a break right before 12 o'clock to swear in Senator Chafee, but except for that period of time where we will be off this bill, it will be my intention, and I know it is the intention of the leadership on both sides of the aisle, to stay on the bill until we finish it. 
   Today we are bringing to the floor a bill that has been a long time in the making. When Glass-Steagall was adopted, Franklin Roosevelt called it the most important and far-reaching legislation ever enacted by the American Congress. In fact, Time magazine just yesterday called it the defining financial legislation of the 20th century. Yet, while it is both of those, or has become both of those, Senator Glass almost immediately after the adoption of the Act bearing his name began to have second thoughts and started the process of overturning Glass-Steagall. 
   We are here today with a bill which I believe will prove to be the most important banking bill in 60 years. It does overturn the key provision of Glass-Steagall that basically divided the American financial system into securities and banking halves. In the process an unnatural competitive environment was created, and over time, the market and the regulators have through a variety of innovations sought to undo this separation. 
   This bill we bring to the floor of the Senate basically knocks down the barriers in American law that separate banking from insurance and banking from securities. These walls, over time, because of innovative regulators and because of the pressure of the market system, have come to look like very thin slices of Swiss cheese. As a result, we already have substantial competition occurring, but it is competition that is largely inefficient and costly, it is unstable, and it is not in the public interest for this situation to continue. 
   The Financial Services Modernization Act strikes down these walls and opens up new competition. It will create wholly new financial services organizations in America. It will literally bring to every city and town in America the financial services supermarket. 
   Americans today spend about $350 billion on financial services--on fees and charges and interest. Most people who have looked at the capacity for our markets under a more rational system believe, as I believe, that there are tens of billions of dollars of savings for the American consumer that will be produced by the reforms of this bill. 
   This bill will allow Dicky Flatt, a printer in Mexia, Texas, to go to the bank and take the checks he has received in his print shop that day and do his banking, deal with his insurance business, work on the retirement program that he and his wife and his employees have, all in one location with all the efficiencies and synergies that come from that. 
   This is a dramatic bill that will produce new products. It will produce a diversity of financial services and products that we have never seen before. Because of the competition in allowing these three major industries to compete head on, these products will be produced and these services will be provided at lower prices than we have ever seen. 
   There has been great debate in the media, and it will go on until the facts are in, as it should. That is what happens in a free society. But when people ask me who benefits from this bill, I answer, everybody who uses financial  services will benefit from this bill: Everybody who borrows money, everybody who has a checking account or a credit card, everybody who buys insurance or securities, everybody who is engaged in modern financial 
   transactions. When you sum all that up, that is everybody in America, for all practical purposes. 
   Once we had decided to tear down these barriers, the logical question was, in providing these new financial services and these new products, how were they going to be provided? Were they going to be provided within the bank itself, or were they going to be provided in a holding company, separated from the bank? We had a very heated debate and, I believe, a debate with very high intellectual content on that subject on the floor of the Senate. It was decided in the Senate by a relatively close vote. It is one of these issues on which everybody's eyes glaze over, but it is an issue that has profound importance. 
   What we have produced in this bill, which is what is always produced in the legislative process, is a compromise. I think the compromise on the question of whether banks should provide these new services within the bank or outside the bank is a good compromise, and I strongly support it. I want to congratulate Larry Summers, the Secretary of the Treasury, and Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for working out this compromise. I very strongly support it. 
   The compromise allows banks, under very limited circumstances, to provide some of these expanded services within the bank. Basically, those circumstances try to deal with two problems about which many have been concerned. I have been concerned about them, Alan Greenspan was concerned about them, and others were as well. We were concerned about safety and soundness and concentration of financial activities within a bank, driven by the potential for a bank benefiting from a subsidy because deposits are insured by the taxpayer, because the bank has access to the Fed window in borrowing money at lower rates than anybody else, and because of the bank's access to the Fed wire, and transferring funds risk free. 
   I believe the compromise deals with that by very severely limiting what banks can do within the bank, requiring that banks, in order to provide even limited financial services within the bank, be extremely well managed and well capitalized. That is, they have to have at least an A rating on their subordinated debt. Subordinated debt is the last debt to be paid, so if you are a bank and you have outstanding subordinated debt, that obligation is paid after the depositors, after the creditors, after everybody. For a bank to have an A or an AA or an AAA rating, it has to be extraordinarily well managed and well capitalized, and banks will not be able to engage in activities within the bank unless they meet that test. 
   We eliminate the double counting of assets that is inherent in providing these services within the bank. If you provide securities activities and services within the bank by setting up a securities operating subsidiary in the bank, you put capital into that securities business, but because it is under the umbrella of the bank, it counts as part of the capital of the bank even though it is committed to capitalizing the securities business. What we require in this compromise--and I think wisely require--is that we eliminate this double counting by saying the capital that is invested in the subsidiary cannot count as part of the capital of the bank. 
   We limit all subsidiaries that banks can engage in, and the investments they can make within the bank itself, to no more than 20 percent of the capital of the bank. 
   So these are very strict limitations. We have an outright prohibition on many activities. In terms of where we started and in terms of the legitimate concerns that were raised on both sides, I think this is a very strong and a very good compromise. 
   The second major feature of the bill is that we promote and strengthen functional regulation. Under the bill, the general rule is that if you are a bank and you are in the securities business, you are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. If you are a bank and you are in the insurance business, you are regulated by the state insurance commissioner in the area where you are engaged in the insurance business. If you are a bank and you are engaged in banking, you are regulated by the bank regulator. By opting for functional regulation, we preserve consumer protection, we lower costs. 
   One of the issues on which an extraordinary amount of time was spent and which for 99.99 percent of the American people would be meaningless is the whole issue about swaps and derivatives. We currently have literally trillions of dollars of swaps and derivatives in the global economy that have become the underpinnings of the financial structure of the country. They are used by sophisticated parties. We went to great lengths in this bill not to upset the current regulatory environment for these products, to see that we did not create any new law giving anybody any new, or removing any existing, jurisdiction over swaps or derivatives. I thank Chairman Levitt and Chairman Greenspan for their help on this issue. 
   Probably the most contentious issue in the bill, as it turned out, was not the decision to repeal Glass-Steagall but what to do with the so-called Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. The CRA was a bill created in 1977, that started out as a very small program, but over the years it has grown to be a very large program with increased enforcement and with greater impact due to the tremendous mergers taking place among financial institutions in America. CRA has literally become bigger than General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler combined. It has evolved in such a way that it not only involves loans but cash payments. 
   Concerns were raised--and I as chairman of the committee raised many of those concerns--that we needed to begin to see a reform process. We have two changes in the bill that are related to reforming CRA. By far the most important is the sunshine provision. The sunshine provision is very important because it recognizes that banks are making CRA payments as part of compliance practices, that while these payments are made with private funds, they are made under public direction. As a result, this money takes on a very clear government tint because it is paid substantially in part as a way of complying with a Federal mandate that has become a cost of business for people who are engaged in commercial banking in America. Because of the fact that these funds are paid as a result of a Federal mandate and a Federal law and a Federal regulatory process, these funds do take on the characteristic of public funds. 
   A decision was made in this bill to make two fundamental changes that I believe will change CRA's operation in America. The first was a decision to require a public disclosure and reporting of CRA agreements. I believe this is fundamentally important. If I am a community activist and I am paid $175,000 in cash by a bank to promote objectives within the community, if people who live in the community don't know that I received the $175,000, purportedly to serve the needs of the community, how can they hold me accountable as to how I used the money? 
   Second, we require on an annual basis both the bank and the recipient of money and things of value under the Community Reinvestment Act to disclose in a report what was done with the money. The language of the bill is very precise and quite demanding on this subject. While we have made a strong effort to give the regulators the ability within this language to reduce regulatory burden and paperwork, the language of the law is very clear, and regulators are given no power to decide to negate or refuse to implement this law as it is written. The language is very clear. The language says in setting out the reporting requirement: ``The accounting referred to in [the report] shall include a detailed, itemized list of the uses to which such funds have been made, including compensation, administrative expenses, travel, entertainment, consulting and professional fees paid, and such other categories, as determined by regulation by the appropriate Federal banking agency with supervisory responsibility over insured depository institution.''  
   It is our intent that the regulators clearly have the authority within reason to try to minimize regulatory burden. If some of this information is included in someone's tax return and 
   they want to submit their tax return in lieu of the report, clearly the regulator has the power to allow that to be done and to make the tax return public. If the tax return did not include this information, it could not be accepted in lieu of this information. 
   The flexibility is flexibility in a reasonable enforcement of the law; it is not flexibility on the part of the regulator to decide to negate the law. As chairman, I say when we wrote ``detailed'' and ``itemized,'' we meant it. 
   As I have discussed with other Members, if one is talking about taking somebody to lunch at McDonald's--we are talking about de minimus amounts--obviously the regulator has the ability to set rules of reason. If one is talking about expenditures of substantial amounts of money either in individual expenditures or the aggregate of those expenditures, or talking about reporting items specifically listed in the law when we wrote it, we meant it. This is critically important. If one is a CRA activist in a city, and they go to Atlanta to a CRA conference, that is a legitimate expenditure to be reported. People expect to see that on their report. If they went to Hawaii for 3 weeks, that should be reported, and people at the local newspaper would have a right, and I think a responsibility, to ask what they were doing with that expenditure. 
   What we are trying to do is reasonable. I urge the regulators to comply with the law and enforce it as it has been written. 
   The second reform of CRA we undertake is regulatory relief. Our ranking member and I got a good laugh out of my arithmetic. Senator BYRD objected to people bringing calculators or computers on the floor, so without the aid of my trusty calculator, I estimated the cost of compliance with CRA was $1 trillion when I meant to say $1 billion. The point is, for small banks, many of whom have fewer than 10 employees, $1 billion is a lot of money. What we have done in regulatory relief is this. We said that every bank in America with less than $250 million in assets will be audited for CRA compliance once every 4 years as the normal audit process if they had a satisfactory rating on their last CRA evaluation. If they had the highest CRA rating, an outstanding, then they would be audited every 5 years. People who work hard to get an outstanding rating would thereby be rewarded. 
   We put into the language the flexibility, for reasonable cause, that the regulators could go back on a case-by-case basis and reduce or increase the intervals at which such audits would occur. By reasonable cause, we mean based on the actions of the bank, the record of the bank. We are not here giving or intending to give, nor can it be reasonably construed to give to the regulators, any kind of blank check to alter the intention of this law. If they have a finding on a factual basis that something has changed, they have the right, as anyone would expect, to go in and to audit more or less frequently. However, they have to have a finding based on facts. 
   When this bill came to the floor of the Senate about a year ago, it had two provisions expanding CRA. One was a provision that said that being out of compliance with CRA was a violation of banking law and could have, in extreme circumstances, subjected a bank officer or director to fines of up to $1 million, and could have given the regulator the ability to impose strong sanctions against the bank as well. 
   That provision is not present in this bill. 
   The second provision of the old bill required a maintenance of a CRA rating in order for a bank to conduct certain activities. That provision is not in this bill. That is critically important, because that would literally have given the regulator the ability to force a financial services holding company, that might have hundreds of billions of dollars in assets in the holding company, to unwind investments as a result of literally one branch being out of compliance with CRA. 
   This bill is very simple and, again, the language is very precise, and meant to be. It says that on the day you become a financial services holding company, you have to have been in compliance with your last CRA report. In other words, with the last audit that was done, you have to have had one of those two ratings, satisfactory or outstanding. This would be in the last CRA report that was filed, and if you had that rating, you are automatically qualified. 
   Once a company becomes a financial services holding company, they can invest any amount of their money and grow any activity already in engaged in within the financial services holding company, without regard to CRA. If they want to commence a new activity, on the date they make that undertaking they have to have been in compliance with CRA as certified on their last CRA report. This does not trigger a new audit. This does not entertain any new protest. It simply is a verification by the regulator that on that day of commencing their new activity, their most recent evaluation will have shown that they had at least a satisfactory CRA rating. 
   The next issue we dealt with was financial privacy. When we dealt with the bill in the Senate, this had not yet become an issue that had inflamed the public's consciousness. We adopted the provisions of the minority substitute related to privacy, and it basically had to do with people who willfully misrepresent themselves to get financial data. We come down on them like a ton of bricks, as we should. But by the time the House acted, financial privacy had become a substantial issue, and the House included very extensive privacy provisions. 
   We have made changes to those privacy provisions, and I believe we have strengthened them, and we have made the bill better. I want to very briefly say a couple of things about privacy. 
   Obviously, in the new world in which we live, we have become accustomed to people knowing a great deal about us. The day I turned 50, I got a kit from AARP with all kinds of applications for AARP and a tube of Preparation H. One might say my privacy was invaded, that somehow AARP found out I was 50 years old. My children got a great laugh out of the Preparation H. One could say that somehow my privacy had been breached, but do we really want a society where an organization such as AARP cannot get access to information about when we turn 50 and invite us to join? I chose not to join because 50 sounded younger every minute to me; 57 sounds younger than it used to. 
   I have hunting dogs, and like many people who have enlightened habits, I subscribe to Gun Dog magazine. I guess because I subscribe to Gun Dog magazine, I get every hunting catalog, every fishing catalog, every dog food catalog, every dog accessory catalog on the planet. I literally get two or three of them a week. Quite frankly, I love getting them. 
   Did Gun Dog magazine violate my most intimate secrets by selling the list so that I get, every once in a while, free samples of dog food or dog bones or a dried pig's ear? I get a lot of things in the mail. I do not think my privacy is being violated. Maybe some people object to that, but I do not. 
   What I have tried to do, and what I think we have done in this bill, is we tried to set a rule of reason. Above the archway going into Delphi, the ancient Greeks wrote: Moderation in all things. It is a hard thing for somebody who feels as strongly about things 
   as I do to remember, but everyone should remember it. 
   We did not want to kill off the information age before it was ever born. We are not writing the final word on privacy. This is something we want to watch and follow and see where abuses are and, when they occur, try to fix them. But, on the other hand, we all benefit. Some people could say we lose. 
   I do not get a Neiman Marcus catalog. One might ask: How come I do not? Neiman Marcus catalogs cost a lot of money to print and mail, and they have somehow figured out enough about me to figure that I do not buy luxury items, so they do not send me a Neiman Marcus catalog. Again, is that an invasion of my privacy? Is my freedom somehow diminished? I do not think so. The point is, if Neiman Marcus can get the catalog to people who are likely to buy something, they can sell it at a lower price, so society benefits. 
   This is what we did on privacy: The most important thing we did was not  in the House bill. It was an amendment that was offered by Senator GRAMS and Senator SANTORUM that put into the bill for the first time a full disclosure requirement. It requires every bank in America, when you open your account, to tell you precisely what their policy is: Do they share personal financial information within the bank? Do they share it outside the bank? We have a comprehensive listing of the conditions they have to meet. Do they disclose nonpublic information once you are no longer a customer? And what do they do to protect information? 
   Why is this important? This is important because this is the ultimate protection of privacy. If I do not believe a bank protects my privacy, I do not want to bank with them. I can bank with somebody else. If millions of people feel the way I do, you will get banks that will set out policies of not sharing information, and they will attract customers. 
   For example, I am proud to have an American Express card. American Express is a great American company. And I am proud I have been a member since 1970 something. They say that they do not share my information on that card with anybody. 
   I do not get that same guarantee from another card, but I get that guarantee from American Express. I happen to have a variety of credit cards. Obviously, I am not very worried about it, but if I were worried about it, I could just use my American Express Card. 
   So I have an opt-in when people give me full information. If I do not like their policy, I do not become their customer. I can opt out. That is the basic freedom. 
   I just add, freedom is based on knowledge and the right to choose, not based on government. I believe that we are guaranteeing that with full disclosure. 
   Second, we adopted the House provision that said if the bank was going to use, or the financial services holding company was going to let people outside the bank have access to, the information, they have to give you the right to opt out. That provision was adopted. 
   Finally, we have a provision in the language which will allow financial institutions to partner with other financial services providers. This will give flexibility that we hope will be implemented to allow, in particular, small banks to share information with their business partners in a manner so that they can compete with a larger corporation that does a variety of activities within the corporation or among its affiliates. 
   Let me talk about one other issue, and then I want to say some thanks and stop, because I know Senator SARBANES wants to speak, and we want to go home. 
   This is not the end of the process. I believe this is the most important banking bill in 60 years. But there will be another banking bill within 10 years, and it will deal with commerce. Banking and commerce is already a reality. This bill is a pause, and it is only a pause, and it is not going to last very long. 
   One of the things that is in this bill, which I am opposed to--it was adopted by a two-thirds vote in the Senate, and here we live by majority rule, by and large--but basically this was a provision that said if you went in and invested money as a commercial company, in a thrift--and many people did when many thrifts were in trouble and we did not have money enough to shut them down--that now you cannot sell your charter unless the charter is broken apart into its component parts. 
   I do not believe this provision and other prohibitions against commerce and banking will last very long. It is just my opinion. I do not view with any great horror the possibility of going to Wal-Mart and having them sell financial services. In fact, I view it as something that would be good. They now do it all over America in partnership with city banks in those towns, but they can only get partners where they have enough customers to make it worthwhile to the bank. 
   The idea they might someday be able to provide the service as part of the overall functioning of Wal-Mart, through a thrift charter or through a credit union charter or a banking charter, I see that as a positive thing. I suspect that a very substantial number of Wal-Mart employees do not have a banking relationship with a credit union or an S&L or a bank. Many of their customers do not. And taking services to them, I would view as a public good, not a public evil. But other people see it differently. 
   What we are doing in this bill is agreeing that we have a pause. I do not believe it will last long. I think in 10 years we will have widespread commerce and banking in America. 
   I want to just say some thanks. 
   I thank Al D'Amato. I do not want people to forget that this bill did not start on my watch as chairman. This bill started when Al D'Amato was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. And while that bill did not become law, and while in some ways this bill is very different from that bill, in other ways the two bills are very similar. 
   Al D'Amato did probably his best legislative work in his career in helping to move this process forward. When we started, we started where Al D'Amato left off. So I think the former chairman of this committee is due a substantial amount of the credit. I wanted to be sure that I began with that, and I did not want to forget to say that. 
   I thank Senator LOTT for his strong, committed support. I think it is clear, without his support, with the long and difficult negotiations we have had, that this bill would be very different from what it is today. I can assure you, as every Member of the Senate knows, when you have your leadership's support, it is like having a good stone wall to your back in a gun fight. It does not keep you from getting killed, but at least nobody shoots you in the back. It has been a very important thing to me as we have negotiated out this bill, very important in a difficult process. 
   I thank Senator SARBANES, who is very knowledgeable and experienced on these issues. I thank him for his input, and that has been input that has varied, from issues to issues themselves, to advice on how, as a brand new chairman, I was conducting my part of the conference. I would have to say that more often than not I think he was right in the comments he made. I believe I have learned from that process. 
   I thank Senator JOHNSON, the first Democrat who signed the conference report. 
   I thank Senators DODD and EDWARDS and SCHUMER and BAYH. They were real catalysts in getting the administration together with us to push the ball over the goal line. I think they contributed significantly in doing that. 
   I thank Chairman LEACH, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, who also served as the chairman of the conference. There have been people in the media who tried to portray this conference as a contest somehow between Congressman LEACH and me. I do not think that is fair to me or to Congressman LEACH. I think Chairman LEACH did a great job. I think he contributed to the process. I would have to say there were difficult times in trying to work things out. Our approaches were very different. But in the end, it worked. And the great thing about success is, it has a thousand parents, and we can all claim credit; and we would have all rightly gotten blamed had we failed. 
   I thank Chairman BLILEY. I knew TOM much better than I knew Congressman LEACH when we started the process. I thank him for his leadership on securities issues and on the bill itself. 
   I thank Congressmen LAFALCE and VENTO, the ranking Democrat members of the House Banking Committee, for their input and their knowledge and their leadership. 
   I thank Congressman RICHARD BAKER, who I believe is a very talented young man, and certainly one of the most knowledgeable people in the House of Representatives on banking issues. 
   I thank Larry Summers and Gene Sperling. I had many hours of negotiating with them and others, and alone with them. If you could make a living selling them something or buying something from them to resell, you would be pretty good. They negotiated hard. They were totally honorable in their negotiations. I am glad that we reached a product that they have enthusiastically endorsed and I have endorsed. 
   I thank Arthur Levitt, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Chairman Levitt raised legitimate security concerns that I thought should be addressed. I and others sat  down with Chairman Levitt and heard him out, and he had a substantial impact on the bill. 
   I thank Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. I have said it on many occasions--and I am always happy to say it again--Alan Greenspan is the greatest central banker in American history; therefore by definition, the greatest central banker in the history of the world. He probably had as much impact on this bill as any non-Member did. His input and impact were always positive. And from the operating subsidiary issue, to virtually hundreds of other issues, his input was critically important. 
   And his general counsel, Virgil Mattingly, is one of these indispensable people who the public never knows about--thinks of them as faceless bureaucrats--but the reality is, his institutional knowledge and good sense had a substantial impact on this bill. 
   I thank all of my Republican colleagues on the conference. We had, at least in my opinion, an effort on the part of some on the House side to try to satisfy everybody. As a result, we got all sorts of amendments that came over to our side of the conference which basically were in conflict with the underlying logic of the bill, 
   many of them popular, as various interest groups tried to go back and recut their deal once more or gain some special privilege or special advantage. I thank Senator SHELBY, Senator MACK, Senator BENNETT, Senator GRAMS, Senator ALLARD, Senator HAGEL, Senator ENZI, Senator SANTORUM, Senator BUNNING, and Senator CRAPO for consistently and courageously voting down every one of those amendments. 
   We have one of the cleanest pieces of major legislation I have seen and, I believe, one of the cleanest bills that has passed Congress in the last 20 years, in large part because these Members knew what they wanted to do. They took a position, and they stuck with it consistently throughout the process. 
   I thank Senator BENNETT, who was chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions, the subcommittee with jurisdiction over major portions of this bill. I thank Senator HAGEL for his leadership on Federal Home Loan Bank issues. I thank Senators GRAMS and SANTORUM on privacy issues. 
   Finally, I want to thank some people on my staff. I thank Dina Ellis, who has done all the hard work on CRA. She is a very sweet lady with a very soft voice, but she is a very serious, tough person. Much of our success in bringing sunshine to CRA and regulatory relief to smaller banks has been due to her great work. 
   I thank Christi Harlan, who has taken the dullest of issues that are totally incomprehensible to most people and done an excellent job in trying to communicate to the media in a form they could understand what was going on and why it mattered. 
   I thank Steve McMillin, who is an indispensable staff member to me. He came to work for me right out of college from the University of Texas. I am from Texas A&M, so I didn't start with any kind of overwhelming expectations. But Steve McMillin has become an indispensable person to me as a legislator. It would be virtually impossible to run my office and do what I do without him. 
   I thank Geoff Gray for his legal work in burrowing in on the issues that didn't seem important until he spoke up. But when he spoke up, they became very important. 
   I thank Linda Lord. Linda Lord, throughout this process, has known more about this bill and more about the underlying law that it changed than all the staff members of all the Members of the House and Senate, of all the staff members of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and all of the outside lawyers who were hired by people to represent their interests, all combined. Her knowledge and the force with which she has presented it have had a dramatic impact on this bill. In fact, the words of this bill are largely her words. She has been an indispensable person in doing this bill. 
   I thank Joe Kolinski, who organized the conferences. It was a nightmare, moving from place to place. He was able to do it all. The mikes always worked. There was plenty of water. It was always crowded, which made people uncomfortable and got them to move on, which was very helpful. 
   Finally, I thank our staff director, Wayne Abernathy. Wayne started on the Banking Committee as an intern and is now the staff director. He knows everything about these issues. I trust his judgment as well as I trust my own judgment. I think I can sum up his contribution--the way I feel about him--by simply quoting a great philosopher who once said: In no way can you get a keener insight into the true nature of a leader than by looking at the people with whom he surrounds himself. I would be very proud to have anybody on Earth judge me by Wayne Abernathy. I think they would be giving me mercy and not justice by doing it. 
   I thank everybody for their contribution, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank Senator SARBANES for his kind remarks and for remembering Bob Rubin, who was a very major contributor to this bill. Let me also say that I think it would be helpful if in the morning everyone will come over so we do not have long pauses. My concern is that we do have a lot of people who are going to want to speak on this bill. We are going to be forced to try to stay with the schedule because the House wants to vote on this tomorrow afternoon. So I hope people will come over and speak so we do not end up with this problem where people are given 1 or 2 minutes when they have something they need to say. 
   I think that can be avoided if people come over early.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Nevada for his amendment and for withdrawing it, and for joining our effort to try to pass the Export Administration Act. 
   As some of our colleagues will be aware, there have been 11 failed attempts to pass a new Export Administration Act since the last one expired. 
   We now find ourselves in a position where despite the Cox report, despite concerns that have been raised about lost American technology, and despite the growing obsolescence of the residual permanent law the administration is forced to operate under, we have not reauthorized the Export Administration Act. I think it is a terrible indictment of the Congress that we have not done that. 
   That is the bad news. 
   The good news is that under Chairman ENZI we have put together an excellent bill. Chairman ENZI has done something I am not aware of any Member of the Senate ever doing. He has gone over and sat through meetings of the current bodies of the executive branch that make decisions related to export licensing. So he has, through practical experience, come to understand the process. He has provided leadership whereby we have put together a bill. He has provided leadership where we literally sat down with everybody who has any interest in this bill. We have had numerous meetings. We have let people submit concerns in writing. I believe we are on the verge of having a bill that is uniformly supported. 
   What our bill tries to do is simple to say and very difficult to achieve. We have a conflicting interest. We want to sell things on the world market which embody new technology because those are items that we have a comparative advantage in producing, and they are items that are high-wage items in the production process. 
   Finally, they represent commodities that will dominate the future of the world economy. So we want to be the leader in selling these types of goods. 
   On the other hand, we have legitimate concerns about technologies. If they are in the hands of people who may be potential terrorist nations or potential enemies of the United States, they could end up hurting our national security. 
   We have taken those two conflicting concerns, and we have put together a bill. The two major features of it are the following: 
   One, we define a brand new concept called mass marketing. It is a very simple and powerful concept. It says if an item is for sale at Radio Shack, if you can buy it over the web site of Dell Computers, if it is generally being marketed in the United States and around the world--though you might wish that it is possible that all of this could happen without it falling into the hands of a potential adversary--the bottom line is there is no practical way at that point that you can keep anybody from getting the technology. 
   So we take mass marketed items out of the process and, hopefully, reduce the number of different items that are under licensing in any given year from about 10,000 to 1,000 so that we could put the focus of attention where it belongs. 
   Second, under current law, if companies are accused and found guilty of wrongdoing in China, despite numerous accusations, all of which carry some penalties, the maximum fine under current law would be $132,000, which for corporate America is a relatively insignificant amount of money. Under our bill, we have a $10 million fine per violation. We also have for a conscious, knowing violation where individuals are involved, prison sentences of up to 10 years, and in aggravated cases, life in prison. 
   So there is a dramatic strengthening of current law. 
   I agree with our colleague from Nevada. This needs to be adopted this year. I believe we have eliminated opposition to it. 
   It simply is now our task to provide leadership where we can bring the bill to the floor later this week, or early next week, and get an agreement that this is not going to become a vehicle for a bunch of unrelated amendments. 
   Having said that, let me stop before I sit down. I want to say a couple of words about the African trade bill. 
   First of all, I congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee for his leadership on this bill. I endorse the African trade bill. Our President went to Africa, did an extensive tour, and talked about what we could do to try to break the bonds of poverty--this crushing, grinding poverty--that people in sub-Saharan Africa face. I think the President rightly understood, if we take all the important aid provided by all the countries in the world and combine them, we have about $40 billion a year. There are 700 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, so if they get all the foreign aid provided by all the countries in the world, we will have relatively little impact on them, and there is relatively little evidence that foreign aid has produced economic development in areas where no economic development ever existed before. 
   As a result, the President proposed bringing in the most powerful tool for economic development ever to evolve in the history of mankind; that tool is trade. The President proposed we open up a fiber trade agreement in textiles with sub-Saharan Africa. I remind my colleagues, under existing agreements internationally, by the year 2005, under the Multifiber Agreement, we will no longer have quotas on tariffs anywhere in the world. We are not talking about a permanent advantage for sub-Saharan Africa; we are talking about giving them a little bit of a head start. 
   Let me briefly define the problem. The average per capita GDP of countries in sub-Saharan Africa is $490 a year; 40 percent of the people in sub-Saharan Africa earn less than $1 a day. The current estimates are, we import about .86 percent of textiles and apparel imported into America from sub-Saharan Africa. The International Trade Commission has estimated that if they devoted their productive capacity to textiles, under this agreement, still within 10 years we couldn't expect more than 2 percent of our textile imports to come from sub-Saharan Africa. We are talking about expanded trade, and we are talking about trade with countries that have no significant capacity to impact American imports of textiles. 
   I believe this bill is needed. I think it is a step in the right direction. I remind my colleagues, for any country in sub-Saharan Africa to take part in this program, they have to do the following three things: they have to make progress toward a market-based economy, they have to institute a democratic society, and they have to open  their trading system. These are all actions that will mean stronger economic growth in Africa, that will mean greater human happiness in Africa, and that will ultimately mean a greater demand for American goods and services. 
   I believe this is an important bill. I believe it should be adopted. I am hopeful we will adopt it today. I intend to vote for cloture and for final passage. 
   There is one provision in this bill in the Senate that is not in the House bill. That is a provision that requires, for textiles and apparel to be imported from Africa, they have to be made out of American fabric and yarn. That same agreement is in the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which I support. But the problem with Africa is that given the transportation costs, and given that their ability to market products is basically based on using longer strand cotton and basically producing different types of textiles that would be relatively new to the American market, I believe the provision in the Senate bill for all practical purposes kills the African trade bill. 
   I am not going to offer an amendment to strike this provision because it is not in the House bill. I hope it will be dropped in conference. We are talking about a relatively small effort to benefit 700 million human beings. The worst thing that could come out of it is that we would have greater diversity in the textile goods that would be for sale in American stores and they would be at lower prices. I can't see anything but good that can come out of this. Anywhere in the world, when we can encourage people to move toward a market-based economy, toward a democratic society, and toward open trade, we are doing things that benefit them and benefit the world. 
   These are important bills before the Senate. I am for them. Trade is vitally important. It is an amazing thing to me that, due to ignorance and prejudice, we continue to restrict the importation of goods and services into America. Why we should give government the ability to impose a tax on working Americans and deny them the ability to purchase, with the fruit of their own labor, better and cheaper goods if they are produced abroad, I don't know. That the greatest trading nation in the world would continue textile laws that cost every working American family of four $700 a year is an absolute outrage. Something needs to be done about it. This is not going to solve that problem, but it is the right thing to do. I hope it will become the law of the land this year. I am hopeful it will. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Let me pose another question. I have a memorandum to the chief actuary at the Social Security Administration which analyzes the President's proposal. I will read one part of a paragraph that analyzes the point the Senator from New Mexico outlined, and that is, the President is saying that in the future, long after it could have any impact on the amount of money we are spending now, we should pay the Social Security Administration for the interest savings we are accruing in the budget from using Social Security surpluses to pay down the debt. 
   When the Social Security Administration in their memorandum of October 23 analyzed that, they concluded the following:  
   Calculation of the assets in the combined trust funds on September 30 of the year 2011 through 2015 would treat all amounts transferred as if--  
   ``As if''--  
   they had been invested in special obligations of the United States. This provision is not likely to have any effect under enactment of this bill alone because the managing trustee of the Social Security trust funds is not authorized to invest any asset of the fund in stock, corporate bonds under either current law or this proposal.  
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-gramm-tx-8-19991026</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAMM. In essence, the Social Security Administration says the proposal acts as if there is a transfer that can be invested, but since it cannot be invested, what you are doing is simply giving Social Security more meaningless IOUs, and the net result is no impact on anything. 
   When the President said in his State of the Union Address now 3 years ago, ``Save Social Security first,'' we never heard a program as to how we were going to save it. When he said last year, ``Save it now,'' we had all of these meetings and all of these proposals, and the President ultimately proposed nothing. 
   Now what we are seeing, sadly, is another gimmick where we do not do anything until the year 2011, and then it is simply a meaningless IOU where the Government owes Social Security but no money is available to pay for it other than if we raise taxes or cut Social Security benefits or cut another program in the 
   future. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding. If there has ever been a fraudulent proposal, this is it. The tragedy is, the President had an opportunity to lead on this. There were Democrats and Republicans willing to follow him, and he did not do it.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what a pity it is that America today is focused on the fact that the President has vetoed the tax bill and is not paying a bit of attention to this debate. So much passion, it is a shame it is wasted, but it is. 
   The President has vetoed the tax bill. It means the average working couple in America will bear $1,400 a year of marriage penalty because the President doesn't believe they ought to get relief. It means all over America people who inherit family farms and small businesses from their parents, who worked a lifetime to build the farms and businesses up, will have to sell them to give the Government 55 cents out of every dollar of value for which their parents worked a lifetime. 
   Because the President has vetoed the tax bill, it means we are not going to have a small across-the-board tax cut for every working American who pays income taxes. Because the President vetoed the tax bill, we are not going to make health insurance deductible for Joe and Sarah Brown, the same as it is deductible for General Motors or General Electric.  
   We know, based on the makeup of the House and Senate and based on the votes of our Democrat colleagues who have been steadfastly opposed to cutting taxes for working families, that we can't override the President's veto. So the tax debate is over. 
   Thank goodness we will have a new President in 15 months. The American people are going to get to vote in part on whether or not Government ought to spend a surplus or give part of it back. When they vote, we will vote again. 
   I say this to the President: I hope the President will not send down to Congress more spending bills, because they will pass over my cold, dead political body. I hope the President is not going to propose raising taxes and spending money because they are going to pass over my cold, dead political body. We can't make Bill Clinton cut taxes, but we can stop him from spending the Social Security surplus. That is exactly what we are going to do. 
   We are going to hear all kinds of whining from the White House about how the President has ``got to, got to, got to'' have more money, even though we are spending more than ever in American history. He has to have more, and we have to steal it from Social Security or raise taxes to pay for it. It is not going to happen. End of that debate. 
   Now, I want to say I have never, since I have been in the Senate, seen a debate so out of kilter with the real issue that is before the Senate. Quite frankly, I have seen few debates that are as mean-spirited as this debate. 
   Here is the issue in a nutshell: For 4 years, the Congress has decided, when we wrote a law setting out royalties on oil production that would be paid to the Federal Government and establishing a system to collect them, we meant what we said; that when the Government entered into contracts with people, that those contracts were binding; and that if people wanted to raise those royalties, that ought to be voted on in Congress. After all, we went to the inconvenience to run for public office, and the Constitution says Congress shall have the power to raise taxes and to spend money. 
   It must be wonderful to have all these things my colleagues hate--big oil, big medicine, big pharmaceuticals--but we are talking about $22 million a year worth of royalties. This is not about money, this is about principle. It is about whether 
   or not Congress ought to set the law and whether Congress has the power to tax, or whether the Federal bureaucracy, through its own power and by its own agenda, with no support from Congress, can override Congress' will and make law. 
   I am proud of my dear, wonderful colleague from Texas. I love my colleague from Texas because she is tough. I have never seen an issue so demagogued as this issue. I have to say to her, she has not backed up an inch and she has won. I think it is a great testament to her courage and to her toughness. I congratulate her on both. 
   The issue is not big oil versus schoolchildren. If the Federal Government raises royalties and therefore raises the deliverable price at the filling station, or when you buy home heating oil, who pays for it? Who pays for it is working men and women. That is food, clothing, shelter, and education they take away from their children. 
   This is not an issue about oil companies versus children; this is an issue of whether we want to take an action through regulation on which Congress constitutionally should be voting. 
   Second, do we want to raise those prices? I do not. In terms of all of this stuff, big oil and political power, they do not have anything to do with this debate. This debate is about whether or not the Mineral Management Service should have unilateral powers to change royalty rates, or whether Congress, which set the rates to begin with, established the process, should have the power to make those changes if they choose. 
   Our Democrat colleagues use terms such as ``fairness'' and ``big oil'' and ``excess profits.'' It all reminds me of when their policy was in effect under President Carter, and we all waited in line to buy gasoline; when their policy was in force under President Carter and we had double-digit inflation. Maybe they want to go back to that. I do not. But to turn this into some kind of political shouting match when we are talking about a debate that involves $22 million a year, which is a small amount but a fundamental principle of American government which is beyond setting a price on, and that is who makes the law in this country? Does the bureaucracy make law or does the Congress make law? 
   Our colleague from Texas has, for 4 years in a row, set out in law the principle that Congress made the law to begin with, and when we are ready to change it, we will change it. We do not need the Clinton administration acting as executive branch, legislative branch, and regulator all combined. 
   So I say to my colleague, I am proud of what she has done. I am proud that she has won, and all the whining and all the moaning and all the groaning does not change the fact that the Senator from Texas stands on the firmest ground that you could stand on, on the floor of the Senate. The Constitution, in article I, gives Congress the power to impose taxes. It does 
   not give the Mineral Management Service the power to impose taxes. Nor will we ever give them that power. That is what this issue is about. I think we demean the legislative process and demean debate by trying to turn this into something that it is not. 
   I know someone from the Mineral Management Service has said --and our colleague from Texas is going to give the exact quote --that we need this issue to demagog. Maybe they need this issue to demagog. But this is the greatest deliberative body in the history of the world. Here we are supposed to be debating real issues.

   Mr. GRAMM. That is the quote I am talking about. I thank our colleague for using it. 
   Let me say this. He can demagog all he wants to. But if he wants to raise taxes, let me suggest to him he quit his job, go back wherever he is from, and that he convince millions of people to elect him to the Senate. Then he can come up here and vote to raise taxes. But as long as he is there and not here, I do not care what he thinks about taxes. It is not his duty to raise them. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am eager for this bill to be complete. I don't intend to offer an amendment, but I would like to say a couple of words. 
   I am somewhat taken by the fact that suddenly the Senate is made up of numerous Members who want to run the airlines. We have undertaken tremendous efforts to be elected to the Senate. In doing so, we have taken up a high calling. We have a responsibility in American Government. 
   But for some reason, yesterday and today, all of a sudden Members of the Senate have decided we ought to take it upon ourselves to tell the airlines in the United States how they ought to be run, and we want to do it without the inconvenience of having to go out and invest billions of dollars. 
   My point is a very simple point. That is, for some reason --I don't know if it is the weather, the change in the barometric pressure, whatever--suddenly Members of the Senate have become experts in running airlines, all without the inconvenience of having to go out and raise money or invest their own money and without the inconvenience of having to take responsibility if their plans go bad. 
   My basic view is that we have good airlines in America. All of us have had bad experiences on airlines: The weather went bad. We have had experiences where we bought a cheaper ticket and would have liked to have flown on a different flight. We wanted a cheap fare, but it would have been nice had they let us fly on the other flight. 
   The point is, we deregulated the airlines. We have benefited from a dramatic decline in the cost of air transportation. Millions of average Americans have moved out of the bus station and into the airport. Now all of a sudden it has become the popular mania in the Senate to want to start having the Congress--in this case, the Senate--run the airlines. I just didn't want it all to pass without making some comment on it. 
   I thank the Chair for the time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I do object to this amendment. 
   Here is the issue in a nutshell. It happens all the time. Someone buys a discount ticket. They get a lower price. They get a lower price because they commit that they are going to use that ticket on that day and they are going to use it as a through ticket. If it is round trip, they commit they are going to use it going and coming. 
   What happens is, they get to the airport early. They find out there is another flight going exactly where they want to go that is getting there an hour earlier. So they go to that other airline and say: Will you take my excursion ticket or my discount ticket? The airline says: Yes, we have an empty seat; we would like to have the money. But they go on to say: The airline you bought the discount ticket from does not allow us to take this excursion ticket. 
   Now, why is that? Basically when they entered into a contract with the airline, they got the discount fare because they committed to fly on that plane on that day. 
   Now, they could have gotten a ticket that would have allowed them to change airlines, but they would have had to pay a higher price for it. Many people agonize constantly when they go on vacation and buy a discount ticket and have to lock in those tickets in advance. It can be misery wondering whether or not you are actually going to be able to leave that day. But the point is, the reason you are getting the lower rate is you are committing to use the full ticket. 
   So the original way the amendment was written is subject to rule XVI. The amendment was not filed at the desk prior to the deadline. I don't doubt anybody's intention, but it is not the sense of the Senate--at least this part of the Senate--that we ought to be getting into the business of trying to tell airlines how their ticket structure should be made. If you don't want to buy a discount ticket, don't buy it. But the idea that we are going to set up a study where we are going to have the Government recommend to Congress, and we are going to begin to try to change laws that say you can have a discount fare, and then you can do things that the discount fare is not based on, that violates the contract. 
   The contract you entered into with the discount ticket is a contract, whereby you agreed you are going to use that ticket on that day or you are going to lose it. It might be convenient to change the day. It might be convenient to fly on another airline, which would mean that the airline you entered into the discount fare with would lose their half of the fare to another airline. But the point is, that is a violation of the contract. I don't need the Government to study whether or not we ought to abrogate private contracts. 
   Therefore, I object to this amendment.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Louisiana for working with me. I think we have worked out language that I can live with and which I think basically does what she wants, which is gather information, and then as a policy-making arm of government we could choose how to deal with it and what to do with it. 
   I will not object to the modification of her amendment. I think it deals with that problem. 
   I say to the Senator from New Jersey that it is a stormy Thursday and we all want to finish the bill. But my objection is for preserving private property with the sanctity of contracts and free enterprise. If the government could run airlines better we all would be trying to rebuild our airlines based on the Soviet model. It didn't quite work out that way. We had an empirical test in the world, and our approach won. 
   I am not trying to defend any interest here other than private property and contracting, and simply noting that for some reason on this stormy day all of a sudden everybody wants to run the airlines. 
   I want to especially thank the Senator from Louisiana. She has been very kind to me. Thank you.

    Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, at the request of the Honorable Elton Bomer, Secretary of State for Texas, I rise today to bring to the attention of my colleagues House Concurrent Resolutions 2, 59 and 133, as passed by the 76th Legislature of the State of Texas. House Concurrent Resolution 2 urges the United States Congress to provide funding for infrastructure improvements, additional personnel and extended hours of operation at border crossings between Texas and Mexico. In order for all Americans to fully enjoy the economic benefits of trade, we must ensure that the Customs Service obtains the resources necessary to reduce delays, promote commerce and combat illicit drug trafficking. The Senate recently passed the Customs Authorization Act of 1999--largely based on legislation I crafted to facilitate trade along the Southwest border--which authorizes the funds necessary to improve our border infrastructure and stem the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. 
   Secondly, House Concurrent Resolution 59 urges the United States Congress to pass legislation allocating a portion of federal offshore drilling royalties to coastal states and local communities. I believe coastal states deserve more than the 5 percent of the $120 billion they helped generate during the past 43 years. States and local communities are more qualified than bureaucrats in Washington to allocate resources to address their specific local needs, and should be given the freedom to do so. By passing this resolution, the Texas Legislature has sent a clear message, and it is time for Congress to act. Common sense invites it, and fairness demands it. 
   In addition, House Concurrent Resolution 133 supports the United States Congress in ensuring that the critical infrastructure for the United States military defense strategy be maintained by withdrawing from public use the McGregor Range land beyond the year 2001. The Military Lands Withdrawal Act of 1986 requires that the withdrawal from public use of all military land governed by the Army, including the McGregor Range, must be terminated on November 6, 2001, unless the withdrawal is renewed by an Act of Congress. As my colleagues may know, the McGregor Range at Ft. Bliss is America's principal training facility for air defense systems, maintaining our military readiness in air-to-ground combat by providing the highest level of missile defense testing for advanced missile defense systems. Texas has a long and impressive history of supporting America's defense, both at home and on the front lines, and I strongly believe that no state contributes more to the defense of our nation than Texas. I look forward to working to ensure that if the lion and the lamb lie to down together in this world, that the United States of America always be the lion.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me remind everyone how we came to this point under the leadership of Senator COVERDELL. A resolution was introduced condemning the President's decision to grant clemency to 16 terrorists who were part of a wave of violence and death across the country that started in the mid-1970s and ended when these terrorists were incarcerated. We sought to bring that resolution to a vote on the floor of the Senate. Our Democrat colleagues, using their rights under the rules of the Senate, objected. We were forced to file cloture to force the consideration of this resolution, and that cloture motion carried. Now we are in the process of debating a resolution where Congress, in this instance, takes the strongest action it can under the Constitution, and that is condemn the President's actions. 
   The President is given, under the Constitution, the power of pardon. There is nothing we can do that would override that constitutional prerogative. But while the President has the right to pardon, I believe the President is profoundly wrong in pardoning these terrorists. 
   Now, I wish I had the ability of our President to articulate so clearly and to put a human face on so many of the public policy issues he discusses because there is a very real human issue involved here. It started with a bombing of historic Fraunces Tavern in Manhattan. 
   This is the front page of the New York Times from Saturday, January 25, 1975. In this article, in excruciatingly painful and bloody detail, it outlines how a bomb was set the day before, how it decimated this restaurant, injured 44 people, killed 4 people, decapitated 1 person. These were innocent people who just had the bad luck to go to lunch at this place, at that time on Friday, January 24, 1975. 
   Some of my colleagues may have read a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, written by two sons of a man who had the bad luck of going to lunch that day in that tavern. Basically, they put a human face on that one brutal  murder. The picture they drew was that of a young man who grew up in a very poor family. Actually, he grew up in a Puerto Rican neighborhood in New York and worked his way up to be successful. Today, both of his sons are investment bankers. So in that sense, he was successful. But he died--and he was 33 years old--because a group of brutal murderers, calling themselves a ``liberation army,'' planted a bomb that day in New York that took this man's life, took him away from his family. The FALN--this terrorist group--claimed responsibility and, in fact, left a note near the bomb scene outlining their grievances. 
   They said they had grievances. So they injured 44 people and brutally murdered four people. 
   That started a reign of terror--the greatest terrorist assault in the history of the United States of America in our homeland among our people, innocent people. This reign of terror continued until these terrorists, now pardoned by the President, were arrested and incarcerated. 
   Our President says, and I quote, talking about these terrorists:  
   They had served very long sentences for offenses that did not involve bodily harm to other people.  
   It is true that while they are the core, or were the core, of this terrorist organization, while they were its leadership, and while they were arrested and convicted for engaging in terrorist activities--they were convicted of things such as unlawful storage of explosive materials--it is also true that the terrorist attacks ended when they went to jail. 
   So you can say they weren't convicted of these specific, brutal tavern murders in New York. They weren't convicted of the bombing on New Year's Eve in 1982 when a New York City police headquarters and other sites were bombed, and in the process you had victims who were blinded in both eyes, who lost five fingers on their right hand, who lost hearing, who required 13 major surgical operations on their face alone, and had 20 titanium screws put in place to hold their face together. They weren't convicted of those particular crimes, but they were leadership, the core, of the organization that claimed credit. Those crimes ended when they went to prison. 
   They were part of the leadership of that organization. They were accessories whether they were there and planted the bomb or not; we do not know, we may never know, but they were accessories before and after the fact as part of FALN. Yet the President says they were nonviolent. 
   If you are going to put a human face on it, you would have to go back and talk to these police officers who have been blinded, and who have had their faces destroyed. You would have to talk to the children and grandchildren of these people who were murdered in the tavern in New York. 
   I call that violence. I call that a fundamental assault on the American people. This is not a violence where someone is selected for retribution, wrong as it may be, for an act they committed. This is violence against people who had nothing to do with this desire to see Puerto Rico an independent nation. These were people living their lives, routinely going about their business, who certainly didn't know about this group, or if they knew, they weren't in any way involved. 
   So to say that these people were nonviolent, who were the core of this terrorist organization that planted 130 bombs that killed and maimed across America, is an outrage. 
   While I know our President has no shame, he ought to be ashamed of that statement. 
   What are we doing? We are here because the President of the United States decided, based on pleas made by various individuals and groups around the country to grant a pardon--clemency--to these people who were leadership of a group that planted 130 bombs in America over a 7-year period and that brutally killed and maimed our fellow citizens. 
   I don't understand the President's action. The FBI was reported to be opposed to it. The Justice Department and the prosecutors who were involved were opposed to it. Maybe I should take the Justice Department out. I don't know. They probably have not heard about it yet. But the prosecutors who were involved were opposed to it. Law enforcement officials across the country were opposed to it. It was supported by some political leaders of the Puerto Rican community in New York. 
   Quite frankly, I don't understand that. Many of these terrorists weren't even from Puerto Rico. They were born in the United States of America. 
   Yet somehow, despite the fact that Americans were killed and maimed, these terrorists are given special status, seemingly because they could identify a cause, a cause, interestingly enough supported by only 2.5 percent of the people who voted in the December 1998 plebiscite in Puerto Rico. 
   We will never know why the President did this. If he did it to court political support for Mrs. Clinton running for the Senate in New York, it turned out to be a bad deal. It turned out to be something that probably was harmful and not helpful. 
   But let me tell you why I am concerned, which goes beyond politics. 
   What the President did was lower the cost for committing acts of terrorism in America. He lowered the cost for committing acts of terrorism in America by pardoning people who participated in a reign of terror that, as far as I am aware, is unparalleled in America's history. 
   If we are going to pardon people who brutally murdered innocent citizens, who maimed and mutilated police officers, then what is the penalty for terrorism? 
   The President says President Carter urged him to pardon them. 
   It is very interesting to note when these acts of terrorism accelerated. In fact, the police headquarters in New York City was bombed 3 years after then-President Carter pardoned the Puerto Rican terrorists who came into this sacred temple of American democracy--the Capitol Building--when there was a quorum call on in the House of Representatives and stood in the House balcony and shot and wounded Members of the House of Representatives. In fact, there is still a bullet hole in the ceiling of the House of Representatives. There is still a bullet hole in the drawer of the Republican leader's desk from that day in 1954. 
   President Carter decided in 1979, 4 years after the Fraunces Tavern bombing, to pardon the Puerto Rican terrorists--which is an inaccurate media description because many of these people were born on the mainland of America--who in this great temple of democracy assaulted civilization itself. He pardoned them and let them out of prison. 
   Three years later, this terrorist group bombed New York City police headquarters, the Manhattan office of the FBI, and the Metropolitan Corrections Center in New York. 
   Here is the point. Jimmy Carter, as President, lowered the cost of committing terrorist acts. Those terrorist acts accelerated after that pardon in 1979. 
   Now the President has pardoned the members of the very group that claimed credit for those acts, and who were convicted, among other offenses, of storage of explosives and conspiracy to make bombs. So, obviously, they were planning more attacks and more bombing. They claimed credit for the bombings in New York--the bombing of the police headquarters, the killing of innocent citizens, the mutilation of police officers. 
   Now the President has pardoned them. I would like to conclude with these points. 
   The President and his spokesman on many occasions have said that fighting terrorism is the No. 1 objective of his administration, that the greatest threat we face in the world today is the threat of terrorists. Obviously, there is some other objective somewhere that is of a higher order because for some reason the President pardoned these terrorists. 
   I think it was a terrible mistake. I believe the American people will hold President Clinton accountable for it. I want to know how the process occurred and whether the process outlined in law was followed. Whatever the process was, the decision was wrong. I believe we should condemn it in the strongest possible language. 
   I hope we get strong bipartisan support. I hope we don't have in the Senate what we saw in the House when some Democrat Members of the House didn't vote yes and didn't vote no. The best they could do is to say they were there that day, and they voted ``present.'' I don't think this is an issue  where Members want to vote ``present.'' 
   I want people to know I think it was an absolute outrage that the President did this. He ought to be ashamed of it. The American people ought to hold him accountable. The Congress, in the strongest action we can take in this matter, is deploring the President's action. 
   I thank our colleague from Georgia for his leadership on this issue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I want to talk about the tax cut. But I can't help but comment, if only very briefly, about the fact that some of the terrorists pardoned by the President are schedule to be released today. They were imprisoned for up to 90 years in response to the convictions that were achieved following some 130 bombings in America--the worst terrorist assault in the history of the United States. 
   We are told by the White House that fighting terrorism is a No. 1 priority. But obviously it is not as important as politics. 
    It is outrageous that at a time when the greatest national security threat facing America is terrorism, that the President of the United States is pardoning radical Puerto Rican nationalists who helped carry out the worst wave of terrorist violence in the history of our country. I think it sends a terrible signal. 
   I notice the President was saying yesterday that among those who had recommended to him that he pardon these terrorists was former President Jimmy Carter. What an interesting paradox it is that this wave of terrorism, in fact, increased in intensity after then-President Carter pardoned the terrorists who were in prison as a result of an attempt to kill President Truman and were in prison as a result of a shooting in the Chamber of the House of Representatives where Members of Congress were wounded. Those acts of violence were perpetrated in the name of the same cause as that espoused by the terrorists who have now been granted clemency by President Clinton. 
   I don't know how long it will take President Carter and President Clinton to understand that terrorism is a threat to America and to every American. When you pardon terrorists, you lower the cost for committing terrorist acts. 
   Our Democrat colleagues have objected for the second time to a simple resolution that condemns the President's actions in pardoning these convicted terrorists. I don't know whether they intend to vote no or whether they intend to vote present, but I don't think there is much confusion. You either believe the President ought to be pardoning these convicted terrorists, or you believe he shouldn't. I wish our Democrat colleagues would let the Senate state its opinion on this important subject as the House did.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, turning to the whole tax issue, I would like to try to set it in perspective. Our President is a master of defining an issue in such a way as to induce the public to support his position. One of his secrets is, he doesn't always tell the truth. So I will try to set this in perspective by trying to define why we believe there should be a tax cut and then outlining the two options that we actually face. 
   I have several charts that I think will speed the process along. The first chart shows the 7 years in American history where the tax burden on the American people has been highest. Interestingly enough, the highest tax burden in American history, as one might expect, was under President Truman in 1945. National defense was taking 38 cents out of every dollar earned by every American as we were winning World War II. 
   The second highest tax burden in American history is the tax burden we'll have on Oct. 1. That tax burden is occurring, by the way, when national defense is taking only about 3 cents out of every dollar earned by every American. 
   The third highest tax burden we have ever had in American history is right now under President Clinton. The fourth highest tax burden occurred last year under President Clinton. The fifth highest occurred in 1944 under President Roosevelt. National defense spending was 38 percent of the national economy. 
   The sixth highest tax level was in 1997, under President Clinton, and the seventh highest tax level was the day President Reagan became President. As we all know, soon after his inauguration, we set about an effort, a successful effort, to cut taxes 25 percent across the board. 
   If you look at these 7 years, you will see that we are facing the second highest tax burden on working Americans in the history of the United States and we have never, except during World War II and under President Clinton, faced tax burdens that approached this level, the only one that was close was the year that we initiated the 1981 tax cut. 
   As to my second point, while the President continues to talk about how risky and dangerous it is to let working Americans keep 
    more of what they earn and why we shouldn't repeal the marriage tax penalty and the death tax, the reality is as shown in this chart, which shows three circumstances. 
   First, it shows the tax burden the day President Clinton came into office. The day President Clinton became President, the Federal Government was taking 17.8 cents out of every dollar earned by every American. Today, the Federal Government is taking 20.6 cents out of every dollar earned by every American. 
   If we adopted a tax cut that took the entire non-Social Security surplus,--and our tax cut is significantly less than the entire non-Social Security surplus because we have finally reached an agreement, which the President initially opposed but finally was shamed into accepting, that we will not spend the Social Security surplus. But if you took the whole non-Social Security surplus and gave it back in tax cuts, the tax burden, when that tax cut was fully implemented, would be 18.8 cents out of every dollar earned by every American, which is still substantially above the tax burden that existed the day Bill Clinton became President. So the adoption of our  smaller tax cut and its full implementation would still mean that during the Clinton Presidency, the tax burden on the American people rose dramatically. 
   A final chart has to do with the part of the story that President Clinton is not telling the American people. President Clinton, interestingly, has it both ways. He says: Don't cut taxes; let's pay down the debt. Then he says: But if you cut taxes--Senator DOMENICI has heard this; Senator NICKLES has heard this--if you do cut taxes, it will jeopardize all these spending programs. 
   I ask my colleagues: If the President's plan is to use the revenues that we are not using to cut taxes and instead pay down debt, why does that jeopardize spending programs? How is that possible? What the President is doing, interestingly enough, is he is getting credit with some Americans for saying let's pay down the debt. He is getting credit with other Americans for saying let me spend it, and in an incredible paradox, he can have it both ways. 
   But facts are stubborn things, and they don't lie. It is hard to cover up facts. I want to remind my colleagues, using the final chart here, that earlier this year, in fact on July 21, the Congressional Budget Office, which is the nonpartisan budgeting arm of Congress, looked at the President's budget and asked the question: How much does it propose to spend and how much would it pay down debt? 
   What the Congressional Budget Office found is that over the next 10 years, the President is proposing spending a net new $1 trillion 33 billion. The President, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is proposing to spend every penny of the non-Social Security surplus, plus spend part of the Social Security surplus. 
   So when the President says: Don't give this money back to working Americans in tax cuts, let's pay down the debt, he is saying something that does not comport with his own budget because the reality is, the President's own budget calls for spending every penny of this surplus on some 81 Government programs. 
   The reality we face is that the President, as he outlined in the State of the Union, has set out some 81 Government programs on which he wants to spend this non-Social Security surplus and part of the Social Security surplus. 
   The real choice is not do you want to buy down debt or do you want to give a tax cut to working Americans. The real choice is, do you want to spend this surplus on 81 Government programs, or do you want to give the money back to the American taxpayers. 
   If I could run the Government by myself, or if the Presiding Officer and I could run the Federal Government, I know exactly what we would do. We would take every penny of the surplus and we would pay down the debt. We would wait until after the election--I am no longer speaking for the Presiding Officer but for myself; I believe my Governor is going to be elected President--and then we would set about doing a real tax cut. 
   The only reason I supported cutting taxes now is we are spending this surplus as fast as we can spend it, and I am worried that it will be gone on 81 new Government programs before we can have an election and elect a new President and address this issue again. 
   So if it were up to me, I would do what President Clinton claims he is doing but something he is not doing; that is, I would stay with the spending caps which have already been broken. I would draw the absolute line and not let a penny of Social Security money be plundered. The President is already proposing to plunder it and is going to veto appropriation bills this year because we don't plunder Social Security money. Remember I made that prediction. I will remind you when it happens. 
   So basically the proof of what I am saying is the following: When the President talks about his budget paying down debt and says our plan does not pay down as much debt, the truth is, when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked at our tax cut, our budget, and looked at the President's budget, CBO found that the President's budget, for the next 10 years, actually pays down $219 billion less in the debt that we owe as a nation than the Republican budget does even with our tax cut. 
   Now, how is that possible? It is possible because the President proposes to spend $1.33 trillion on new spending programs, which is the entire non-Social Security surplus, plus part of Social Security money. So that is the real choice. I think what the American people need to think about next week when the President vetoes the tax bill is they need to look at those 81 Government programs, and they need to look at our tax cut. Look at the 81 Government programs the President wants to expand, or create and then look at our tax cut and decide which would benefit their family more. I think if they benefit more from the Government spending, they ought to support the President and they ought to vote for a Democrat for President and Democrats to control Congress. But if they believe they can spend their money better than the Government can spend it for them, I think they ought to vote for a Republican President and for Republican Members of Congress. 
   Lest anybody has forgotten, let me conclude by simply going over what our tax cut does. Our tax cut repeals the marriage tax penalty. As many Americans are aware, because a married couple has a lower standard deduction than two single individuals, and since a married couple gets into the 28-percent tax bracket quicker than two single individuals, the average American couple actually pays the Federal Government $1,400 a year for the privilege of being married. 
   Now, as I like to point out, I want to make it clear that my wife is worth $1,400 a year--a bargain at the price. But I think she ought to get the money and not the Government. 
   So that is the first thing our tax change does. It eliminates the marriage tax penalty. Now, marriage may not be for everybody, but it is the most powerful institution for human happiness and progress in history. I think having a Tax Code that discriminates against people who get married is a bad mistake and ought to be corrected. 
   The second thing we do is lower tax rates. We lower each individual bracket by 1 percent, so that every person in that bracket is taxed 1 percentage point less. If you are being taxed at 15 percent, we lower it to 14. If it is 28 percent, we lower it to 27. If it is 31 percent, we lower it to 30. 
   We repeal the death tax. We believe when Americans work a lifetime to build up a business, to build up a farm, and they pay taxes on every penny they earn, and then they invest their aftertax money in building up a family business or family farm, it is wrong for the Government to force their children to sell that business or that farm in order to give Government up to 55 cents out of every dollar that they built up in that farm or business in their working life. 
   I know we have Democrat colleagues who say, well, some rich people will benefit. That may be true. But this tax is wrong. It is not right. It is double taxation, and it is very harmful to force children to sell off farms and businesses to give the Government taxes when somebody dies. It is not right when your parents die that the first official contact you get from the Government is from the Internal Revenue Service, in essence, telling you that the lifetime work of your parents has to be sold off to give the Government up to 55 cents out of every dollar that they have earned and set aside in their lives. It is not right. 
   Another provision of our bill is that we make health insurance tax deductible for the self-employed and for those people who work for companies that don't provide health insurance. Why should health insurance be tax deductible for General Motors but not for Joe Brown? We think that is discrimination. We think everybody ought to be treated the same. 
   Now, my final point. You have heard our Democrat colleagues and our President say that the Republican tax cut is unfair. Normally, what they mean in saying it is unfair is something like: Do you realize that about 30 percent of Americans will get no tax cut from the Republican tax cut? You hear that and you say that doesn't sound right. But what they never point out is, roughly 30 percent of American families pay no taxes. We are talking about cutting income taxes, and about a third of American families pay no income tax. 
   Let me tell you how I feel about this. Taxes are for taxpayers. Tax cuts are  for taxpayers. Everybody doesn't get Medicaid. Everybody doesn't get Medicare. Everybody doesn't get food stamps. Everybody doesn't get welfare. You have to qualify for those programs by either paying money in, in the case of Medicare, or being poor, in the case of Medicaid, food stamps, and welfare. 
   Republicans feel very strongly that tax cuts are for taxpayers. If you don't pay taxes, you don't qualify for a tax cut. That brings me to the final point I want to make. Some people say, well, maybe there could be a compromise between Congress and the President. Let me tell you why there can't and why there is not going to be. It looks as if the President has proposed a $300 billion tax cut, we have proposed almost $800 billion, and there is $500 billion between us. So it doesn't take a genius to figure out you could end up somewhere in the middle. 
   Let me tell you why it is not going to happen. When the Congressional Budget Office looked at the President's tax plan, they found $245 billion for USA accounts and concluded that it actually increases spending by $95 billion, net, over 10 years. 
   Basically the President's tax cut is a set of subsidies that are given to people who by and large do not pay taxes, so that it is really an expenditure instead of a tax cut. 
   Instead of being $500 billion apart, the plain truth is, we are closer to $1 trillion apart. I think in this case, rather than fool around in trying to find some midpoint between minus $95 billion, which is a tax increase of $95 billion, and an $800 billion tax cut, the best thing to do when the President vetoes the tax cut is to let the veto stand. We don't have the votes to override the veto. The best thing to do is to take it to the American voters and let the voters decide in November of next year what they want. 
   I don't think at this point that a compromise can be worked out. I think basically we are going to have to make a decision as to what we want. That is how democracy works. You make a decision when the American people go to the polls. I think on this tax cut we are not going to find a middle ground. I think we are going to have to let the American people move the middle ground in the election. 
   But I think there is something we have to do. I want to stay with the spending caps. It is clear now, when you count all the emergency spending, much of which is not emergency, when you get into all of the bookkeeping gimmicks that ultimately will be used, that we are not going to stay within the spending caps, that we are going to spend beyond those caps. I am sorry about that. I think it is a mistake. 
   But there is one barrier we have not yet broken. It is a barrier where I believe, when the President vetoes the tax bill, we have to draw the line. We have to draw the line in saying, Mr. President, we can't make you give this money back to the American people but we can stop you from spending the Social Security surplus. 
   I hope Republicans will have courage enough to stand up and say no to any proposal that takes the Social Security surplus, plunders it, and spends it on general government. I can tell you that I intend to stand by that position. I am hopeful that Republicans in the Senate and the House will stand by it. It is not going to be easy. 
   Our appropriators in both the House and the Senate and the President tell us that unless we spend vast amounts of additional money, the world is going to come to an end in one of a variety of ways. 
   I think the time has basically come to say to the President that we can't make you cut taxes but we can stop you from spending this money. 
   That is what we want to do. 
   I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the majority leader for offering the resolution condemning the President's action in granting this clemency to convicted terrorists. What I want to do is begin by reminding people about the activities conducted by the organization to which these 16 terrorists belong. I then will remind people that we are about to see history repeat itself because a President has pardoned and given clemency to Puerto Rican nationalist terrorists before. Then I will make some basic observations about how outrageous I believe the President's action is. 
   First, I remind my colleagues that on November 1, 1950, two terrorists who were, or at least claimed to be, promoting independence for Puerto Rico attempted to shoot and kill President Truman. One of the gunmen was killed and the other was sentenced to death but President Truman subsequently commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. On March 1, 1954, three such  terrorists opened fire from the gallery of the United States' House of Representatives--in fact, there is a bullet hole in the ceiling of the gallery of the House of Representatives to this day and to this day, a bullet hole remains in the desk of the Republican leader on the House floor. Several Congressmen were wounded in the attack, one of them quite seriously. This was in 1954. 
   In 1979, then-President Jimmy Carter pardoned the three Puerto Rican terrorists who were involved in the House of Representatives attack and the terrorist who attempted to take the life of President Truman. 
   The point I want to make, and I think if you will listen to this pattern of activity you will see that we are in grave danger of history repeating itself. Several terrorists tried to kill the President; others actually shot and wounded Members of Congress; Jimmy Carter becomes President and pardons them, and I believe you will see when I go through the list of terrorist acts committed by those terrorists who are now being given clemency by President Clinton that there was a surge in such terrorist activity after the Carter pardons, when it appeared to became clear that you could actually attempt to murder the President, shoot Members of Congress, commit terrorist acts, and be pardoned by the President of the United States. In short, history is about to repeat itself. 
   We use clinical terms in talking about these people. But I want to go back and give first a review of history and then I want to talk about four of their acts. Then I will talk about three of their victims. I will make my point and get out of the way and let other people have an opportunity to speak. 
   Let me review the following facts. On Wednesday, August 11, President Clinton offered clemency to 16 terrorists who were members of the notorious FALN, Armed Forces of National Liberation, terrorist group in exchange for the simple act of agreeing not to use violence to promote their political agenda. I wonder if one looked at every felon, every murderer, every terrorist, every drug dealer in every prison in America and asked them, Would you be willing to say you won't do it again if we let you out, my guess is there would be no one left in any prison anywhere in America. That is the President's standard. 
   The New York Times reported on August 27 that the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, and the U.S. attorneys in Illinois and Connecticut, flatly opposed President Clinton's offer of clemency to these terrorists. 
   Newsweek reported this week that some of the 16 terrorists offered clemency were captured on tape by the Bureau of Prisons discussing a return to violence upon release from prison. 
   The FALN carried out 130 bombings of key political and military locations throughout the United States. The number of such attacks, and their frequency, has never been rivaled by any terrorist group in the history of the United States. 
   The 16 terrorists who were offered clemency are serving prison sentences ranging from 15 to 105 years. 
   Most of the 16 terrorists were charged with seditious conspiracy and weapons possession connected to 28 bombings that occurred in northern Illinois in the late 1970s. 
   Despite the President's generous deal, and demonstrating a clear lack of remorse for their reign of terror and destruction, 13 of the 16 terrorists have called the President's offer of clemency ``intolerable.'' 
   On Wednesday, September 8, 12 of the jailed Puerto Rican terrorists accepted President Clinton's offer of clemency. 
   That is a recounting of the recent events. 
   Let me talk about four of the crimes that were committed because, again, it is easy to talk about this act of clemency and pardon by the President, and sometimes it is hard to remember what happened. 
   In January of 1975, members of this terrorist group bombed a historical site in lower Manhattan and killed 4 people and injured 53 people. 
   In August of 1977, they bombed the Mobil Oil Corporation building on East 42nd Street in Manhattan and killed a 26-year-old young man. 
   On New Year's Eve in 1982, their terrorist acts accelerated; they bombed the New York City Police Headquarters, the Manhattan office of the FBI, the Metropolitan Correctional Center, and other locations, seriously injuring several New York City police officers, including Detective Richard Pastorella. 
   Let me tell you about him. 
   Detective Pastorella was blinded in both eyes. He lost all five fingers on his right hand. He is deaf in his right ear and lost 70 percent of his hearing in his left ear. He required 13 major operations on his face alone. He had 20 titanium screws used to hold his facial bones together. 
   Let me give you a quote from him: ``You wake up with nightmares at night, cold sweats. It never leaves. It never goes away.'' 
   The second police detective who was wounded in this terrorist attack on New Year's Eve in 1982 was Anthony Senft. He underwent five operations in 1983 alone. He is blind in his right eye. He has diminished hearing in both ears. His nose, eyeball sockets, and hip have been reconstructed. 
   Police Officer Rocco Pascarella had his left leg amputated below the knee. He is deaf in his left ear. He lost 20 percent of his hearing in his right ear. He is legally blind in his left eye. 
   Let me make two other points of fact, and then I will say what I have to say. 
   Carmen Valentin, one of the 16 terrorists offered clemency, called the judge a terrorist when she was being sentenced and said that only the chains around her waist and wrists prevented her from doing what she would like to do; and that is, kill the judge. 
   Ricardo Jiminez shouted to the judge, when he was sentenced to prison, ``We're going to fight ..... revolutionary justice will take care of you and everybody else!'' 
   The worst wave of terrorist attacks in the history of America were committed by the group to which the 16 people whom the President is in the process of pardoning and letting out of jail, belong and all he asked is that they say they won't do it again. 
   Joe Lockhart, the White House Press Secretary, on September 8, 1999, when he was talking about the Osama bin Laden terrorist case, said: ``You know, I think that our efforts to bring terrorists to justice are one of the highest priorities of the president's national security agenda.'' 
   I ask my colleagues, if bringing terrorists to justice, if deterring terrorism is one of the President's top priorities, what is he doing pardoning 16 terrorists who killed Americans on our own soil? 
   When we are facing, as our greatest national security crisis in the world, terrorist acts, when we are threatened with terrorism in our homes and in our cities and in our businesses, in our capital, in the Capitol Building, in our embassies, when we are trying to deter terrorist acts, what is the President of the United States doing pardoning people who have committed such acts? 
   I think I know what he is doing. I think he is playing New York politics. We have offered a resolution condemning this action by the President. 
   I wonder, if the First Lady were a Senator, if she would cosponsor this resolution. I wonder if our Vice President, who is running for President, supports the President's policy. I wonder if he would support this resolution. 
   But I say I think it is an absolute outrage, at the very moment when we face terrorist attacks and threats to our embassies all over the world, when we face the very real threat of terrorism in the heartland of America, at the very moment when our No. 1 national security problem in the world is terrorism, we have the President of the United States pardoning terrorists who are reported to have no remorse about the acts they have taken, and at least some evidence is available that they have said they will commit these acts again if they are freed. 
   As I have said earlier, I do not know what kind of standard it is, saying you are sorry and you won't do it again. By that standard, we would release every criminal in every prison in America. 
   But I believe Congress should go on record. Let me also say that if we could overturn the President's decision, I would be in favor of doing it. The President has the right to pardon under the Constitution. We have no powers, as far as I am aware, to overturn that decision. But if we could, I would offer an amendment to do it. 
   Let me say to the minority leader, it is true that this resolution was just introduced last night. But there is hardly  anything startling in this resolution. Basically, this resolution says that we deplore what the President has done. You either deplore it or you do not deplore it. So I think we can engage in these parliamentary gimmicks for a while, but I think eventually people are going to understand. 
   I say, as one Member of the Senate, we are going to vote on this resolution or we are going to vote on a cloture motion related to it. 
   We are going to have Senators on record. I think people have a right to know whether you think it is a good idea for the President of the United States to be pardoning terrorists who have killed Americans. I think this is a very serious matter. 
   It is a very serious matter, not because it has to do with New York politics, not because we have gotten into this absurd charade where the President clearly undertakes this action to respond to a political constituency in New York only to see it backfire--the First Lady is opposed to it unless they say they are sorry and they won't do it again--I think that is, to a large extent, beside the point. The real point is, at a time when the greatest threat we face to national security is terrorism, what are we doing pardoning terrorists? 
   I conclude by asking my colleagues, do we never learn anything? When we had terrorists promoting with violence and attempted murder exactly the same cause of the terrorists that the President is pardoning today, when we had terrorists with the same goal shoot Members of Congress in 1954 and try to kill President Truman in 1950, and when we see Jimmy Carter as President in 1979, pardon those terrorists. What happened in the 1970s and 1980s? New members of the terrorist group committed acts of violence in the same name to promote the same objective. We have a process. If people in Puerto Rico want to be an independent nation, let them choose to do it. But let's not use violence to promote an objective. I think civilization breaks down when we allow that to happen. 
   We saw terrorist acts in 1950 and 1954. Jimmy Carter came into office, pardoned the terrorists in 1979, and you have heard me describe some of the terrorist acts that took place in the early 1980s, and now we are about to repeat, in my opinion, the same sad history. I think this is a bad idea. I think it is wrong. I am opposed to it. I think it is outrageous. I think the President ought to be ashamed of it. I think the American people need to hold him accountable. I think the American people have a right to know who finds the President's act deplorable. 
   I do. I want people to know it. I think our colleagues ought to be on record, and they will be as a result of this resolution. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have been called many things, some not always so flattering or nice, but I have never been called unconservative because I thought we ought not to let Government spend working people's money rather than giving it back to them. 
   There have been a lot of issues raised, and I want to go through and answer each and every one of them. Let me start with the rhetoric of our dear Democrat colleagues about, let's pay down this debt; don't give this money back to working people; we don't know what they are going to do with it; they might waste it; they might use it in an unwise way. Let Government keep it and we will pay down the debt, our Democrat colleagues say. 
   But the problem with that rhetoric is it does not comport with the facts. Our problem is what they are doing speaks so loudly on this issue that we cannot hear their words. 
   I have here a chart. I know this chart is hard to read because my mama saw it on television and could not read it. But believe me, I can read it, and I am going to read it to you. 
   Both sides tend to claim we are right about figures. But to make Government work, we have a nonpartisan organization called the Congressional  Budget Office that is made up of experts, accountants, economists, that basically serve as a reality check on both Democrats and Republicans. 
   They just completed what they call their Mid-Session Review, where in the middle of the year they looked at the President's budget, which our Democrat colleagues are supporting, and they looked at our budget resolution, which included our $792 billion; and they reported to the Congress and the American people about these two competing programs and what they would mean in terms of the Government budget. 
   If you listened to our Democrat colleagues, they are trying to tell you it is a bad idea for us to give back roughly 25 cents out of every dollar of the projected surplus to working people. They say: Let us pay down debt. 
   But when the Congressional Budget Office looked at the President's budget, they found that the President is proposing, over the next 10 years, in his budget, to spend $1.033 trillion on increases for 81 Government programs. They found that the President proposes spending $1.033 trillion on 81 programs as an alternative to our tax cut, and since our tax cut under the Republican budget is $792 billion, we actually pay off $219 billion more in debt than the President does. They talk about this money being used to pay down debt, but the President not only spends every penny of the non-Social Security surplus, he has to plunder the Social Security trust fund in 3 of the 10 years just to pay for all of his new spending. 
   So when you hear one of our Democrat colleagues say: Oh, it is a terrible idea to give working people back roughly 25 cents out of every dollar of the surplus because wouldn't it be better to use it to buy down debt? Please remember that the budget they support, written by President Clinton, spends every penny of the non-Social Security surplus, plus roughly $29 billion. So while they say: Let us buy down debt. Their program is to spend every penny of that money on increasing 81 government programs. 
   The reason this is so important that people understand is, this is not a debate between buying down debt and tax cuts. In fact, as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has shown, after you look at all the spending the President wants to do, he would buy down debt $1.959 trillion. Our budget, with this tax cut, would buy down debt $2.178 trillion, or $219 billion more. 
   The debate is not between buying down debt--in fact, we pay off more debt than the Democrats do. The debate is between spending the money on these 81 Government programs versus letting Americans keep more of what they earn. 
   If we were going to have a totally honest debate, it would be our Democrat colleagues standing up and talking about these 81 Government programs and the $1 trillion they would spend, and asking working Americans tonight to listen to what they say; listen to our tax cut; and then sit down around their kitchen table and ask themselves a question: Can Government in Washington, with President Clinton's programs, spend this money to help our family more than we could if we got to keep the money to spend on our own family? Can they do a better job spending our money than we can? 
   Obviously, that is a very different debate. Our colleagues do not want to have that debate. But their budget would spend every penny of the non-Social Security surplus. 
   So when people are saying: Don't give this tax cut. Let us buy down debt, their budget spends every penny of this money, plus 
   plundering some of the Social Security trust fund. 
   So the debate is about whether we let the American people have the money and save it or spend it or invest it or whether they want to let Government spend it. 
   Our colleague said: Let's put some money away in case the good times don't last. Who is better to put money away in case the good times don't last? Working people, with their own money, or Government? When is the last time anybody remembers the Government putting money away for a rainy day? 
   I don't remember it. We are already $21 billion over the spending totals that the President and the Congress agreed to. We are not putting any money away here in Washington. 
   Yesterday, we had the adoption of a farm bill that spent another $7.4 billion, taking every penny of it right out of the surplus. So this money is being spent, is the first point, and that is the debate. 
   The second point is, some of our colleagues have said: Well, boy, this is a huge tax cut, and we don't need this tax cut. 
   And so I have two sets of figures I want to ask you to look at. The first is very interesting to me. These are the 7 years in American history where the tax burden on the American people has been at its highest level. One of my staffers, clever as he is, summed this up by saying, the ``Causes of Record Taxes: War and Clinton.'' Because if you look at the record tax burdens in American history, out of the six highest, four of them are Clinton years, and two of them are World War II--Harry Truman and Franklin Roosevelt--when defense was 38 percent of the economy and 37 percent of the economy. Now it is less than 3 percent. 
   The only other year where we have had a tax burden even approaching the one we have now was the year Ronald Reagan became President, and we were debating cutting taxes across the board by 25 percent. 
   Our colleagues say: Well, it was just a terrible thing to do. We should have never cut taxes when Ronald Reagan was President. 
   A couple making $50,000 a year, had we not had the Roth-Kemp tax cut, would have been paying $12,626 a year now in income taxes instead of paying $6,242. Our Democrat colleagues think that would be great. We thought it was a bad idea. So in the Reagan budget we cut taxes. The economy started to grow. We rebuilt defense. We won the cold war. We tore down the Berlin Wall. A lot of good things happened. 
   But this is the most telling chart of all. You hear all this stuff about: Oh, this is a huge tax cut, and many of the writers and many of the columnists are beginning to pick this up. But nobody goes back and looks at the facts.

   Mr. GRAMM. I will be glad to yield when I get through if I have time. 
   Now here are the facts. If you take revenues over the next 10 years that are projected, our tax cut is less than 3.5 percent. In other words, our tax cut cuts taxes, in terms of projected revenue, by under 3.5 percent. That is this huge tax cut we are talking about. 
   But this chart is really telling. The day Bill Clinton became President, before we raised taxes--or President Clinton raised taxes--many of our colleagues have pointed out that not one Republican voted for that tax increase; and I am proud to say that is true--before he raised taxes in 1993, the Government was taking 17.8 cents out of every dollar earned by every American in Federal taxes. 
   Today the Federal Government is taking 20.6 cents out of every dollar earned by every American in Federal taxes. That is the highest peacetime level of government taxes in American history, the second highest tax burden, second only to 1944 in American history. If we took the whole $1 trillion non-Social Security surplus--and I note that we are taking less than $800 billion--if we took all of it and cut taxes, we would still be taking, when the full tax cut is in effect 10 years from now, 18.8 cents out of every dollar earned by every American in Federal taxes. 
   Why is that important? It is important because what is being called a huge tax cut actually leaves taxes substantially above where they were the day Bill Clinton became President. So what is being called a huge, irresponsible, riverboat gamble--I was thinking Senator BREAUX might want to defend riverboat gambling--what is being called a huge gamble, we are simply talking about giving back some of this huge tax increase. By the way, the President said later, at a fund-raiser, that he raised taxes too much in 1993. Our tax cut would still leave the tax burden substantially above where it was when Bill Clinton became President. 
   Let me address the issue very briefly about rich people getting this tax cut. You need to understand when our Democrat colleagues speak that they have a code. The code is, every tax increase is on rich people; every tax cut is for rich people. So you don't ever want to cut taxes because it helps rich people.  You always want to raise them because it hurts rich people. You are not for rich people. 
   The problem is, when that argument was made on the President's tax increase in 1993, they taxed gasoline, and gasoline is bought by both the rich and the poor. They taxed Social Security benefits on incomes of $25,000 or more. That is hardly what we call rich. 
   When we debated this issue when it first came to the Senate, one of our colleagues got up and said: The Roth tax bill gives 60 percent of the tax cut to the top 25 percent of income earners in America. Can you imagine that this tax cut gives 60 percent of the benefits to the top 25 percent of income earners? But nobody bothered to point out that the top 25 percent of income earners pay 81.3 percent of the taxes. The truth is that the Roth tax cut, in terms of the rate cut, actually makes taxes more progressive, even though it reduces everybody's taxes. It reduces lower-income people's taxes more. 
   Actually, I wanted it to be cut across the board. You have heard many people say: Some 30 percent of Americans under this tax cut get no tax cut. Can you imagine a tax cut where almost 30 percent of the people get no income tax cut? That sounds crazy until you realize that roughly 30 percent of Americans pay no income taxes. Most taxpayers don't get food stamps. They don't get TANF. They don't get Medicaid because they are not poor. Those programs are not for them. 
   Tax cuts are for taxpayers. If you don't pay taxes, you don't get a tax cut. It is not because we don't love you. It is not because there is something wrong with you. It is just that tax cuts are for taxpayers. So we are cutting income taxes. If you don't pay income taxes, you don't get a tax cut. Remember that when you hear all this business about rich people and poor people. 
   Quite frankly, I think we do our country an injustice when we keep trying to pit people against each other based on their income. The plain truth is, if we could calculate this out, the Roth tax cut, the parts of it that we have enough data on in this short period of time to look at, it probably makes the tax code a little more progressive than it is. I don't think we ought to be doing that. I don't have any problem in saying, if you don't pay any taxes, you don't get a tax cut. If you pay a lot of taxes, you get a lot of tax cut. 
   If we had a 10-percent across-the-board cut--unfortunately, we don't quite get that; I am proud of what we got--but if 
   Senator ROCKEFELLER makes 10 times as much money as I do, he would get 10 times as big a tax cut. Some people get upset about that, but I don't get upset about it. 
   Alan Greenspan has become, his utterances at least, almost like a bible. Everybody quotes him to make their point. Generally the people quote him to make points that are 180 degrees out of sync. If you listen to the quotes by many of our Democrat colleagues, you would believe that Alan Greenspan has said: Never, ever, ever, under any circumstance, should we give anybody a tax cut. The reality is, what Alan Greenspan has said is very clear. His first preference would be to not spend any of the surplus and to not give any of it back in taxes. But Alan Greenspan says:  
   If you find that as a consequence of those surpluses they tend to be spent, then I would be more in the camp of cutting taxes, because the least desirable outcome is using those surpluses for expanded outlays.  
   I submit that is exactly where we find ourselves when we look at the fact that we are spending the surplus as quickly as we can spend it, and the President has proposed spending $1 trillion of it over the next 10 years. 
   The final point I will make, before summing up, is that several of my colleagues have been joshing me--and boy, it is legitimate. When I was in economics, I never made predictions that would either prove true or false within 100 years. And then I didn't worry about it. 
   It is true that when President Clinton submitted his economic program, as we debated it in those first 2 years, I said some awfully unkind things about it--not things you couldn't print in the paper, but they weren't generous. I suggested that if it was adopted, we would have a recession. 
   Our colleagues have said: Well, look at the wonderful economy we have. 
   In my final, major points, I will, as Paul Harvey, give you the rest of the story. To listen to our colleagues today, they would have you believe that all of the Clinton program was just a tax increase. But there were two other parts of it. If we are going to be fair to my quote, we need to be fair in saying there were two other parts of the Clinton program in those first 2 years. It certainly did raise taxes. I certainly was against it, and I still believe the economy would be better off if we had not done it. But the other two parts our Democrat colleagues want to forget. The first was a major spending program that spent $17 billion in the first year.

   Mr. GRAMM. The second part of the program that everybody doesn't talk about is a proposal to spend $17 billion to ``stimulate the economy.'' Our colleague from Oklahoma remembers it because we discovered, in one of the happiest discoveries in recent political history, that when you looked at that program, it was going to spend money on programs off a list submitted by communities, and on that list was an Alpine slide in Puerto Rico and an ice-skating warming hut in Connecticut. 
   We had endless good times about that and, in the end, while we had a Republican minority and a Democrat majority, we actually filibustered and killed the $17 billion of spending. 
   I don't have my copy of the Clinton health care plan here, and that is probably good because if I picked it up, I might get a hernia. The third part of the program was for the Government to take over one-eighth of the economy by having one giant HMO--I think it was called a health care purchasing collective, or something--and all the doctors would work for the Government and the Government would run the health care system. So if we are going to be fair in quoting my statement, let's remember that the plan had three parts; we killed two of the three. 
   The final thing--and I probably ought not do this, but we are getting ready to go on recess, so why not. ``Bill Clinton balanced the budget and made everything wonderful.'' We have all heard that. We heard it right before I got up to speak. But I have in my hand President Clinton's budget for fiscal year 1996. This was the budget that the new Republican Congress got in January of 1995. I do remember this. One of my staff provided me with these unkind remarks, when I said in 1993, regarding this Clinton health care bill, ``If we pass it, we will be hunting Democrats down with dogs all over America.'' Well, we didn't pass it, but we did elect the first Republican majority in both Houses of Congress since 1952. 
   In any case, to finish my point, when this new Republican Congress got here, this was the budget the President had sent them. This budget, right on page 2, projected a deficit of roughly $200 billion through the year 2000. The new Republican majority took this budget and threw it into the trash can, and we adopted a new budget. 
   On this chart, here is the Clinton deficit projected in 1996. This is what we achieved with the Republican majority. Now, did we really do all that? No. Did Clinton do all that? No. The plain truth is that we had basically a stalemate, and we stopped virtually all new spending. In fact, with all this talk about the gloom and doom, we were able to control spending a little bit. The economy took off and we balanced the Federal budget. 
   So let me sum up by simply saying this. I want to congratulate our chairman, who has put together a tax bill that is as good a tax bill as you can write in the Senate and get 51 people to vote for. I want to congratulate him for his leadership. If you trust the American people and their ability to spend their own money better than the Government, vote for this tax cut. If you believe the Government can spend it better and will make America richer, freer, and happier by spending it, rather than letting them have it, then you ought to vote against it. That is the choice. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I know it is kind of late tonight and everybody is eager to go home, and I know we are dealing with a farm bill, an agriculture appropriations bill. I also know that this amendment is cloaked in the garb of being a sense-of-the-Senate resolution and sense-of-the-Senate resolutions tend to be viewed as relatively insignificant. 
   I want to argue that this is not insignificant, that this amendment is not based on any scientific study. We should not be making a major energy policy decision in America tonight at 7:30 as we debate the agriculture appropriations bill. I want to argue that we should table this amendment. Let me explain why. 
   First of all, we all have trouble pronouncing it. MTBE is an ether derivative that EPA has certified lowers the amount of pollution generated when an internal combustion engine burns gasoline. This ether derivative makes gasoline burn more thoroughly. As a result, it is the dominant oxygenate used in reformulated gasoline all over America. It has been a major contributor toward improving the environment in those areas of the country where there is both a high concentration of automobiles and people. 
   We have had relatively limited scientific analysis of this problem, other than a clear finding that California's underground storage tanks are leaking gasoline into the ground. If there are holes in these tanks, it seems the obvious solution to the problem is to fix those underground tanks. 
   When gasoline leaches into the ground, the gasoline and all of its components start to leach through the soil. What has been found, and what our dear colleague from California is referring to, is the discovery that this ether derivative, in areas surrounding leaking underground storage tanks, is starting to show up in ground water and in wells. Ultimately, if these leaks are not fixed, all the other components that make up gasoline will be found in ground water. 
   Here are the problems: 
   No. 1, compared to MTBE, ethanol is in very limited supply, and our Nation's capacity to produce more of it is substantially limited from year to year. 
   No. 2, ethanol has several problems that MTBE does not. Let me state two. One, it tends to vaporize at a much lower pressure. We are going to create a problem because ethanol vaporizes  more rapidly than MTBE and could in itself create another environmental problem. Two, Distributors have a very difficult time getting it into various parts of the country. It is quite competitive where it is produced, but it is very difficult to transport. If this should be implemented, the result of these two problems would be a spike in gasoline prices. 
   Ethanol is a wonderful derivative, and I am not arguing one against the other. I am trying to explain that if you remove the dominant derivative and attempt to ban it, you force the substitution of another derivative which has a fixed supply from year to year based on agricultural production levels. You are going to produce shortages that will be exacerbated by the fact that ethanol tends to degrade in a pipeline. 
   I urge my colleagues to not get into a long debate on a subject that few Members are qualified to debate. Fortunately, the distinguished chairman of the Environment Committee is here, a man respected by people on both sides of the aisle, who opposes this amendment. I will let him explain why. 
   To sum up, here is the problem. We have leaking underground tanks. We need to fix the leaks in the underground tanks. It is bad to go around pouring gasoline, no matter what additives are in it, into the ground. Rather than California fixing its leaking underground tanks, we are being called on by the Senator from California to take a major step in going on record by encouraging Administrator Browner to ban MTBE, which she has the power to do. 
   This is not a trivial, throw away sense-of-the-Senate resolution. We are, by taking this position, in essence, encouraging the Administrator to take action that would produce gasoline shortages in over half the country, that would spike gasoline prices, that would create a new environmental problem because of vaporizing ethanol. Why are we doing it? Because we have leaking underground tanks. Let's fix the tanks. 
   If the Senate were asking support for programs to do something about the leaking tanks, that would be one thing. But to ban a gasoline additive, which is the dominant additive in producing clean air in America because you have holes in tanks that are not being fixed in California is a policy which I think is totally irresponsible. This is not a decision that should be made by the Senate on a farm bill at 7:30 tonight. 
   I urge my colleagues, when the motion is made to table this amendment, to vote to table it. Not because Members are not concerned about leaking underground tanks and about MTBE in potential underground water or drinking water, because I think we ought to be concerned.

   Mr. GRAMM. Let me finish and I am happy to yield. 
   I think we ought to be concerned. But the Committee on Environment and Public Works is holding hearings; they are working with Administrator Browner; they are trying to come up with a comprehensive policy in committee. 
   This is an area that is very complicated. I don't think there is anybody here, without reading it off a piece of paper, who can pronounce the ether derivative that is MTBE, much less understand its chemical makeup and its advantages in clean air and its disadvantages if you spill it in a creek. 
   So I do not doubt the Senator from California is well intended, trying to do something that she thinks sends a good signal. But we are not talking about signals. We are talking about the energy policy of a nation that is dependent on energy. This is not a good policy to decide on the floor when the committee of jurisdiction is working on this problem right now on a bipartisan basis. So I urge my colleagues to not support this amendment, and in tabling it, simply refer it to the committee of jurisdiction. Let's get a comprehensive look at it; let the committee decide how to deal with this problem. 
   Might I say, I am from one of the ten largest corn-growing States in the Union. I hope my colleagues from farm States are not going to jump onto bad science, bad environmental policy, and disastrous economic policy in the name of trying to ban the use of MTBE, which receives no Government subsidy, in favor of ethanol, which is already highly subsidized. I hope we will not get into this deal, ``I am going to support it because I have corn in my State.'' 
   I have corn in my State and I have oil in my State. I am glad the Lord put one there and we brought the other there to grow it. But the point is, this is a serious issue that deserves more attention than it is going to get tonight in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I hope my colleagues will vote to table this amendment and give the committee an opportunity to do something about it.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say I admit I have not read the study, as probably 98 other Members of the Senate tonight have not read it, which is the reason we ought to have the committee of jurisdiction look at it. 
   Second, when we are talking about something leaking into ground water from tanks, my point is that this is a problem with tanks. We do not have this problem in Texas. We have gone to  great lengths to try to deal with underground tanks that leak. We have required the tanks to be dug up in every old filling station in the State. 
   I think the Senator has raised a legitimate problem about leaking and underground water sources. But the point is we need to fix the tanks. I know of no study that suggests that fixing tanks does not solve the problem. 
   In any case, I want to conclude so Senator CHAFEE and others can speak. But I want to remind my colleagues that the EPA has the power to act in this area. I urge my colleagues not to put the Senate on record, on a subject that we have relatively little knowledge about, on a farm bill, when we are talking about a policy that has profound environmental impact, including the potential for more air pollution because of the higher vapor pressure for ethanol as compared to MTBE; second, shortages of gasoline potentially in huge quantities of the country because of, one, eliminating the dominant oxygenate in fuels from consideration; and, second, the problem of transporting the alternative to MTBE; and, finally, the potential spike in gasoline prices that could occur. 
   This is simply a policy we ought to be dealing with in a systematic way. I am delighted the chairman of the committee is dealing with it because it is a serious problem. 
   I yield the floor. Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I did not come over this morning to get into a political debate about farm policy. But the issue is so important that I thought there were some things that need to be said that I do not believe have been said. I would like to preface my remarks by saying that, to the best of my knowledge, my State is the biggest beneficiary of American farm programs, not on any kind of per capita basis but because we have a lot of farmers and ranchers. 
   I am very concerned about the drought in some parts of the country, which we have a long tradition of responding to and dealing with. That tradition has been based on documenting the drought, documenting the loss, and then compensating people who lose. It has not been based on anticipating a loss, estimating it, appropriating money on a widely discretionary basis and allowing bureaucrats to give out literally billions of dollars. That has never been the policy in the past. I do not think we ought to undertake it today. So before I get into the text of what I wanted to talk about, let me make it clear there are many areas of the country that are suffering from drought. We have a long tradition, an established program. I have been supportive of that program and I intend to continue to be. 
   What I want to talk about is not the drought. What I want to talk about is what is happening in agriculture and my concern that we are partially misreading what is happening. I want to talk about farm prices, and I want to talk about the two remedies that have been proposed and that are currently before the Senate, and I want to voice my concern about both of them. 
   I do not want to get into a political debate about farm policy, but I want to make the point that I believe we are drifting far afield from any kind of rational farm policy in America in what we are doing. Maybe some would view it as an unkind judgment, but in my opinion we are engaged now in a political bidding contest where we simply are seeing figures made up on both sides of the aisle, I would say, where we are competing to show our compassion and competing to show our compassion with somebody else's money. I would be moved into thinking this was pure compassion if we were debating giving our own money. But since we are debating giving the taxpayers' money, it is hard to be compassionate with somebody else's money. 
   Having said that, I see this farm problem a little bit differently than most of my colleagues. Since I do not think this point has been made in the debate, I want to make it. 
   First of all, it is clear, and I think everybody is in agreement on this, that American agriculture has been affected by the Asian financial crisis and that the demand for American farm products from Asia has fallen off by 40 percent. The demand for farm products is what economists call ``inelastic.'' That is, when the price changes, it doesn't have an immediate, instantaneous or substantial impact on production. So this decline in the demand for products in Asia has had a substantial impact on price. 
   Obviously, we are all hopeful that Asia is going to recover from its financial crisis and that they are going to be back in the market and that this part of the factors that are driving down farm prices will go away over time. That is the basic logic of the proposal that has been offered by Senator COCHRAN. It basically is that as the Asian financial crisis is solved, as Asians get used to, once again, consuming American farm products--the best rice, the best meat, the best cotton; as they get used to the joys of wearing cotton underwear made of American cotton--they are going to buy a lot more of it and everything is going to come back and prices are going to be good again. To the extent that thesis is correct, the right thing to do is to adopt the Cochran substitute. 
   The Democrat substitute is really based on the logic that there are no markets. Our Democrat colleagues do not largely believe in markets and do not, by and large, believe in the basic 
   principles of economics. They would rather the Government make the price of farm products. So it is not surprising that their substitute has grown from $9.9 billion to $10.7 billion, 50 percent bigger than Senator COCHRAN, but they would basically begin to take steps to go back to the old supply management program where the Government would be the setter of prices and where we would, in essence, take American agriculture ultimately under this program out of the world market. 
   The problem with that, besides having a substantial impact on the state of the American economy, is that primarily, while there are many farm State Senators, there are relatively few farm district Members of the House. If we go back to supply management, given the apportionment of representation in the House, we will never set prices that will be high enough to produce prosperity in rural America. 
   So I know all of the rhetoric, going back to the 1920s, much of which has very leftist roots, would lead many of our Democrat colleagues to believe if we could get Government to manage agriculture, we could make it great. The problem is--and I say this as a person representing an agricultural State, a State that produces most farm products, the only State in the Union that produces both cane and beet sugar, a State that is in virtually every kind of agriculture that you can name--the plain truth is that agriculture does not have enough political clout, day in and day out, to get the Government to set prices high enough that we will ever have true prosperity in rural America. That is why I am never supporting going back to the Government managing agriculture. 
   The only chance we have to make rural America not just a good place to live--because it is the best place to live. When I ultimately leave Washington--and I hope to be here as long as STROM THURMOND, which would give me another 40 years--I do not ever plan to live in a town that has a stoplight again. I prefer rural America. I think it is the best place to live. I want to make it one of the best places to make a living, which is why I was for Freedom to Farm and why the underlying philosophy of the Cochran program is superior. 
   It does not appeal to people who want Government to manage things, who believe that Government can do it better. But the plain truth is, without being unkind, there is only one place in the world where socialism still has dedicated adherents, and that is on the floor of the Senate and the floor of the House of Representatives. Everywhere else in the world it has been rejected. But here it still has dedicated adherents, people who believe if we just let Government run things--health care, agriculture, whatever--that it would go better. I do not believe that is true. 
   But I want to go beyond simply pointing out the superiority of the Cochran approach to the Democrat substitute. I want to raise a question about both because there is another force at work that nobody is talking about, and with which we are going to have to come to grips. Frankly, in representing a farm State, it is something about which I worry. 
   It is a blessing that creates a problem. The blessing is that while America is in the midst of a technological explosion, technology in agriculture is growing twice as fast as technology in the economy as a whole. Productivity  per farm worker is growing twice as fast as the productivity of the worker in the economy as a whole. So there is an underlying factor which is driving down farm prices which has nothing to do with the Asian financial crisis. That underlying factor is the explosion of farm technology. Farm technology, by driving down the cost of production, is driving down the cost of farm products by increasing supply. 
   Let me give an example of it. We have fewer chickens in America today than we had 10 years ago. Yet we are producing more poultry. We have fewer pigs today and yet we are producing more pork. How is that possible? Because of a technological revolution that is occurring in American agriculture. 
   As I look at agriculture and as I look at the use of sensors, as I look at the use of new technology, nobody can know the future but it seems to me, looking at it--the only way we can see the future is by looking to the past. Looking at the recent past, it seems to me we are probably on the edge of an explosion of technology driven by biotechnology, driven by sensing devices, driven by the communication age where we are probably looking at a 20-year period where the natural trend in farm prices, independent of the Asian financial crisis, will be down. 
   Please do not believe because I say this that I want the trend to be down. But I think if we are going to set out a long-term policy, we have to understand the world at which we are looking. I believe these technological changes, which are partially responsible now for declining farm prices, are probably not going to go away. 
   One of the things I think that is hidden--I will get to these figures in a moment--is that while farm prices are down, so are farm costs. So this is leading some people to look at farm prices and define a financial crisis which is clearly there but not to the degree that the price of the final product alone would show. 
   Let me note that we had a recent estimate come out by USDA of net farm income. Let me also remind my Democrat colleagues that the Clinton administration runs the Department of Agriculture, not the Republican majority in Congress. The Clinton administration is now forecasting 1999 farm income to be $43.8 billion. Farm income in 1998 was $44.1 billion. So that is three-tenths of $1 billion below last year. 
   If you look at the last 8 years, from 1990 through 1998, average farm income has been $45.7 billion. We are looking at an income level that is basically $1.9 billion below that level. If you look at the last 5 years of average farm income, it has been $46.7 billion. So in looking at that number, we are looking at an income level there where we are about $2.9 billion below that level. 
   Part of the story that is not being told in this debate, as we sort of jockey back and forth as to who can tell the grimmest tale in agriculture, is that the current farm program is doing a lot for American agriculture. 
   Last year, the American farm program, in dealing with a decline in prices, put into American agricultural $12.2 billion of income. Under the existing programs that are in place, through guaranteed minimum prices, and other programs, we are looking already, without any legislative action, because of the way the current law is written, at the taxpayer paying $16.6 billion of payments to farmers. Or, in other words, when the Department of Agriculture estimates that net farm income next year is $43.8 billion, 39 percent of that estimate is made up of payments that are being made under the existing farm program. 
   Especially when our Democrat colleagues get up and talk about the sky falling, they completely leave out of the story that under existing programs we have guaranteed minimum prices, through our loan program, that will mean $16.6 billion of payments from the Federal Treasury to the American farmer without any legislative action whatsoever by the Congress. 
   So I guess the first question that I pose is, that if farm income today is $2.9 billion below the average of the last 5 years, and if the income for the last 5 years has been the highest level of income in the modern era, Why are we talking about $10.7 billion of new payments to American agriculture? 
   From where did the $10.7 billion come? And $10.7 billion added to the level of farm income today would put average farm income substantially above the average for the last 5 years, substantially above the average for the last 8 years, and substantially above the average of farm income in the modern era of America. From where did the $10.7 billion come? 
   It seems to me that the $10.7 billion figure is simply a political figure. It started out fairly low at the beginning of the year. It has gotten bigger every month. I now understand that in the House, Democrats are asking for $12.9 billion. So what is happening is we are in a bidding contest. 
   Let me also say that in terms of the $6.9 billion that has been proposed on our side of the aisle, I do not see the logic of that number, either. It seems to me that since we have a loan program which in some cases has yet to be triggered because we have not harvested the crops, so that we do not know, in the final 
   analysis, the extent of the drought or the impact of the bumper crop that is being produced in some parts of the country --we know the impact on price for corn and wheat and cotton and soybeans; we have a guaranteed minimum price--the logical thing to do would be to not get involved in a political bidding game but to simply allow the crop to be harvested, assess the drought damage, and decide how much to do and how to target it to the people who have actually lost money instead of a giant effort to simply throw money at the problem. 
   I am sure all of my colleagues are aware that from the disaster assistance for agriculture last year, still some of those programs have yet to be spent by the Clinton administration. So rather than getting in a bidding contest, it seems to me, with all due respect, that what we ought to be doing is waiting until our crops are harvested and assess what farm income is, compare it to a norm for the recent historic period, and then decide what we want to do to try to make a correction, see to the extent to which programs that are now in effect have an impact on farm income, and then figure out what the gap is compared to the norm, and then decide who lost money, and then see what we might do about it. 
   But with $10.7 billion, if you spent the money by giving it to farmers, you would drive incomes far above the national norm, you would be overcompensating, in some cases, several times; and in reality, much of this money goes to a bureaucracy in Washington and not to the farmer. 
   So I am sorry that we have gotten into this debate, which ultimately had to come when we brought up Ag appropriations because we are going to have an election on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of next year. So we are engaged in this political bidding contest for the support of American agriculture. I do not see how these kinds of numbers can be justified, especially when we do not know what farm income is going to be. 
   Let me also say that this appropriations bill does not even go into effect until October 1. 
   Not one penny that would be spent by the adoption of either one of these amendments will be available to farmers until October 1, and given the record of the Clinton administration, it is highly probable that most of this money won't even be distributed until next year. My point is, why don't we wait until we have the actual data, until we know who actually lost money, and make a rational decision. 
   Another point I would like to make----

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, there are some other figures I think we need to look at in deciding what we should be doing. I want to raise these. I know people are going to object to the fact that someone would actually try to raise concerns about the actual numbers we are talking about in American agriculture, when we are engaged in a debate about trying to outbid each other and spending money. This is from the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This  is their agricultural outlook, just published in July of this year on page 55. 
   Let me tell my colleagues why this is important, and then I will go through the numbers. Why this is important is, we are basically pointing fingers back and forth saying we are not doing enough for American agriculture and that we ought to spend $10.7 billion or we ought to spend, in the House, $12.9 billion. I will go over a few figures which stand out to me in that somehow what is being shown in the actual numbers about agriculture and what is being debated on the floor of the Senate are two entirely different things. 
   Facts are persistent things. In listening, especially to our colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle, one would assume that farm assets are falling right through the floor. One would assume we are virtually back in the Depression and the Dust Bowl and that USDA initial estimates for 1999 would be falling dramatically. Anybody who is listening to this debate would believe that is true. 
   Well, it is not true. In fact, in 1998, the preliminary number is that the total value of farm assets was $1,124,700,000,000. The initial estimate by USDA--this is the Clinton administration--is that farm assets at the end of this year will be $1,140,300,000,000. So while we are talking about the world coming to an end in agriculture, we have to junk the farm program and go back to letting Government dictate farm prices and engage in artificial scarcity and pay farmers not to plant and basically turn agriculture into one giant cooperative on the Soviet style plan because of the collapse in American agriculture. The reality is that we are projecting farm assets to rise this year and not fall. In fact, last year was a terrible year in agriculture. We had a huge farm payment at the end of the year as part of our emergency spending. 
   What do you think happened to farm assets last year? They went up, not down. They rose from $1,088,800,000,000 to $1,124,000,000,000. Something about this picture doesn't fit. 
   Let me go on. What do you think is happening to financial assets held by American farmers and ranchers? If you listen to all this doomsday scenario from our Democrat colleagues about how we have to junk the farm program and go back to a Government-run program, you would think farmers and ranchers are having to sell off financial assets, cash in their retirement, withdraw money out of the bank, close down their IRAs to try to stay in agriculture. 
   Facts are persistent things. In fact, we are projecting that financial assets held by American agriculture will actually rise this year from $50 billion to $51 billion. 
   Now, what do you think is happening to farm debt? You listen to all of this doomsday discussion about how we have to junk the farm program and have an American commissar of agriculture who has to go in and say: You cut back production by 20 percent; you plant this crop; you plant that crop; we will guarantee your prices. We will have artificial scarcity, and then we will make all this work through Government edict. What is the justification for all these program proposals? The justification, you would think, would be that farm debt is exploding; right? We are having a crisis? 
   Does anybody listening to this debate believe that farm debt in America is not exploding? You would never believe it wasn't exploding. You would think farmers are going deeper and deeper and deeper into debt. You would be wrong. In fact, the USDA estimate is that farm debt will actually decline in 1999, and it will decline from $170.4 billion to $169.1 billion. 
   What would you think would be happening to real estate debt? In listening to our Democrat colleagues talk about how we have to have the Government take over agriculture and go back to a program where you basically work off Government edicts because of a collapse in agriculture, you would think real estate debt is rising. People are having to borrow money against their land. They are having massive foreclosures. Could anybody listening to this debate not believe that real estate debt was exploding in America? They couldn't. They would know it had to be happening. But facts are persistent things. The fact is that real estate debt is actually declining in America. The projection by USDA is that the amount of real estate debt that farmers and ranchers have will decline from $87.6 billion to $86.7 billion. 
   Could anybody listen to this debate and not believe that non-real estate debt that farmers have is exploding? That is not possible. You listen to this debate, you have to conclude that every farmer in America is going deeper and deeper and deeper into debt. They are borrowing money. They are losing money. There is a catastrophe, a crisis, and we have to have Government take over agriculture. But astounding as it is, when you look at the numbers, non-real estate debt in agriculture is actually projected to decline in 1999 from $82.8 billion to $82.4 billion. 
   Finally, there could be no doubt about it, listening to this debate. Equity in farms and ranches in America has to be plummeting. There is no way that you can have all these catastrophes we have heard about, leading us to the argument that we need to spend in excess of $10 billion right now in agriculture, and we need to junk our whole export production-based farm system to go back to a program that we couldn't make work in a simpler era when the Government basically ran agriculture. No one could doubt, not one person who listened to this debate, if you did a survey, not one person in 1,000 would have any doubt that farm equity, the equity of farmers and ranchers, what they own, has to be declining as a result of this agricultural crisis. But it is not so. In fact, equity, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is projected to not only rise but to rise substantially in 1999, to rise from $954.3 billion to $971.2 billion. How can farm equity be rising when we have a crisis of such magnitude that we are debating having the Government take over American agriculture? 
   Well, the reality is, it is rising. 
   Let me mention two other figures. Could anybody listening to this debate believe that the debt-to-equity ratio in American agriculture is actually declining in 1999 or that equity is rising and debt is falling? Could you believe that, listening to this debate? You probably could not, but it is. And in terms of debt-to-assets, it is also declining from a ratio of 15.2 to a ratio of 14.8. 
   Now, the reason I went through all these numbers is, we should not be having this debate right now. This has turned into a political bidding contest where we are literally bidding to see who can spend more money. We need to know what is going to happen in terms of this year's harvest, and we need to know what farm income is when the harvest is in, before we set out a program to spend billions and billions of dollars to, A, be sure we are helping the people who need help and, B, be sure that the program makes sense. 
   There are some things we should be doing. We should be working to open world markets. Part of Freedom to Farm was a commitment to change trade policy. We ought to be debating trade today. We ought to be talking about how we can get the President to go ahead and finish the negotiations with China on WTO accession, so that they would have to lower their trade barriers against American agriculture. We should be debating taxes today. We committed to a program of letting farmers not only income average but to set aside a certain amount of income for a 5-year period, so that when times are good, they can set aside money so they have it when times are bad. 
   We ought to be talking about risk management and what we can do to deal with it. We ought to be talking about regulatory reform, where regulations are having a heavier and heavier burden on American agriculture. But we are not. What we are doing is talking about spending vast sums of money when we have no documentation of the exact magnitude of our problem or the distribution of that problem. 
   Now, I know the vote is going to be on, and I know we are going to have it this afternoon. I know we are going to have an opportunity to spend $10.7 billion to junk the American farm program and go back to supply management. I know we are going to have a vote on spending $6.9 billion to keep the current system and just allocate $6.9 billion to be given away if and when, later on, the administration gets around to allocating it. But surely there must be some question raised when average farm income for the last  5 years has been $46.7 billion. The projection by USDA is that farm income will be $43.8 billion, and the adoption of either one of these amendments will produce farm income far above the average of the last 5 years. 
   Why is that a problem? It is a problem because if I am right that this explosion of technology in agriculture, which is growing twice as fast in terms of technological advances as the whole economy, if this is going to mean that for 20 years we are going to tend to have downward pressure on agriculture prices because of expansion in production and lower cost of production, to be in essence subsidizing and encouraging people to come into agriculture, or stay in it if they are inefficient, we are working counter to what we know has to happen for agricultural prosperity to occur. 
   The reason I went to the trouble to come over here and raise all these unpleasant facts in the midst of a debate about giving money is that there is one other figure that just is extraordinary to me. What would you think is happening to the amount of land being rented by American farmers? Prices are falling. We had prices falling last year, and we had an emergency spending bill. What would you think would be happening to cash rents? Well, everything I know about economics and about agriculture would tell me that, knowing what happened last year with prices declining and knowing the projections for this year, cash rents would have gone 
   down. Everything you know would suggest that. But, in reality, cash rents are up--up--so that farmers are spending more money renting land in 1999 than they did in 1998. What does that suggest? Well, it suggests that what we did in 1998 actually pulled in more production, not less, and that we actually contributed to this problem by what we did in 1998. 
   The world is not going to come to an end if we spend $10.7 billion or $6.9 billion. Every penny of it is going to be added to the deficit. That is money that is not going to go to reduce debt, or fix Medicare, or pay for Social Security. We have all heard and used all those arguments--mostly when it benefited our side of the argument. 
   But please consider what is going to happen if we continue with these programs where the net impact is to bring more resources into an industry that is having a technological explosion, which is expanding supply, where we are producing more pork with fewer pigs, more poultry with fewer chickens--what is going to happen if we continue for 3 or 4 more years the kind of program we had last year, which apparently--and I simply raise the concern because nobody has mentioned it--what is going to happen if we are paying so much money that we are actually encouraging more production rather than compensating people partially for their losses. The adoption of either one of these amendments will mean that farm income next year will be above the average for the last 5 years. 
   Now, I would like farm income to be high. But the point is, I am afraid we are overriding the natural adjustment mechanism whereby, as people can produce more and more product with fewer inputs, what tends to happen is, they put fewer inputs into the industry. If I am right about this technology change, we are, with either one of these dollar figures, planting a seed that is going to destroy American agriculture as we know it because we are going to end up exacerbating oversupply and driving prices further and further down, and then we are going to have no choice except to let an awful lot of people go broke or to have the Government come in and say: OK, you produce at 50 percent of your capacity, and you produce at 50 percent of your capacity. 
   I just wish we were having somebody look at these kinds of problems before we got into this bidding war in the midst of an Agriculture appropriation bill. I wish we could wait until the fall and know what the losses were. None of this money will be available until October 1. Then we can come up with a reasonable program to try to compensate for some of these losses. But to simply be making up numbers in the billions is very dangerous and irresponsible, and we could end up really hurting the most efficient farmers and ranchers. 
   I thank my colleagues for giving me all this time. I yield the floor.

    Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Rear Admiral (Select) Barry Costello, United States Navy, for the excellent job he has done as the Director of Senate Liaison for the Navy. I want to recognize Admiral Costello for his many achievements and commend him for the exemplary service he has provided to the Senate, to the Navy, and to our great nation. 
   Barry Costello is a sailor's sailor who has distinguished himself through his seamanship, tactical acumen, and inspiring leadership. He has served on some of our country's finest warships, including command of the destroyer U.S.S. Elliot (DD 967). Prior to coming to the Senate, he commanded the prestigious ``Little Beavers'' of Destroyer Squadron 23, following in the footsteps of Admiral Arleigh ``Thirty-One Knot'' Burke, who famously led the ``Little Beavers'' to a decisive victory over Japanese forces in the Battle of Cape Saint George in 1943. 
   In March 1997, Admiral Costello took the helm of the Navy's Senate Liaison Office. His integrity, enthusiasm, and foresight have earned the admiration of all members of the Senate who have worked with him, and it is not an exaggeration to say that through his service to the Senate, Barry Costello has helped to ensure that our Navy remains the best trained, best equipped, and best prepared naval force in the world. 
   Mr. President, Rear Admiral (Select) Barry Costello exemplifies what is best in the Navy and in America. The Senate, the Navy and the American people are indebted to him for his many years of distinguished service. As he departs for his first assignment as a flag officer, I know that my colleagues wish Barry, his wife LuAnne, and their sons Aidan and Brendan the very best. I have a feeling we will work with Barry again in another more important role for our Navy and our nation.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, you would have had to have just come in on a turnip truck not to realize this Congress is a major funder of Pell grants. We provide substantial funding in Pell grants in guaranteed student loans. What we have before us is not another assistance program, not another program that is trying to single out every interest group in America and give them something, but instead we have a tax bill that is aimed at letting working Americans keep more of what they earn so they can help send their children to college. 
   I hope we might see an amendment such as this withdrawn and not have to vote on it. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have the highest admiration for the chairman of the Finance Committee. I am supportive of the tax cut he has crafted in committee. I intend to vote for it on final passage if this amendment fails. 
   But I believe we need a clearer vision. I believe we need to define very precisely what we would like to use this tax cut to do, rather than running around trying to stick a nickel in everybody's pocket with a targeted program. 
   I would prefer to have a tax cut that has clear themes and this is a very simple substitute because it consists of simply five things. So this is a tax cut that you can explain to every American, and it contains basic principles that I believe every American can understand and support. 
   The first principle is we ought to have an across-the-board tax cut of 10 percent. Now, I know our Democrat colleagues are going to jump up and down and say, first of all, that 32 percent of American families pay no income taxes, and so if you have an across-the-board tax cut, they will not get a tax cut. And that is right. Tax cuts are for taxpayers. If you don't pay taxes and we have a tax cut, you don't get a tax cut. Most Americans don't get food stamps; most Americans don't get TANF; most Americans don't get Medicaid because they don't qualify for those programs. If you don't pay taxes, you don't qualify for a tax cut. 
   Our Democrat colleagues are obviously going to jump up and down and say that Senator ROCKEFELLER, who pays 10 times as much taxes as I do, with a 10-percent across-the-board tax cut, will get 10 times as big a tax cut. That is right, but he pays 10 times as much taxes. If you ask people in your church to take up money to build a new parsonage and it turned out you had taken up too much money, and you decided to give it back, isn't the logical way to give it back to simply take how much an individual gave and take the amount that you didn't need and give it back to them proportionately? 
   So the point is, the first principle we believe in is there ought to be an across-the-board tax cut, so every American who pays income taxes will get a tax cut. Now, our Democratic colleagues have said they believe if you are rich, which means you are in the upper half of the income distribution--and they design that as roughly making somewhere around $50,000--you don't deserve a tax cut. In their proposal, you basically don't get one. I want to remind my colleagues that by excluding people who pay 99 percent of the income taxes in America, they are excluding from a tax cut 62 percent of all homeowners, 66 percent of all Americans between the ages of 45 and 64, 67 percent of all families who have children in their homes, 67 percent of all full-time workers, 68 percent of all Americans who have some college education, 69 percent of all married couples, and 80 percent of all two-wage earner families in America. 
   Our Democrat colleagues love investment, but they hate investors. They love the benefits of capitalism, but they hate capitalists. An across-the-board tax cut gives everybody a tax cut, and if people pay a lot of taxes, they get a bigger tax cut--not proportionately, but they get the same tax cut. If that offends you, if you believe that somehow people who make over $50,000 a year are the enemies of the people and they ought to continue to be punished, you would want to be against this provision. 
   The next thing this provision does is it eliminates the marriage penalty. Most Americans are not aware of that because our Tax Code is so perverted, if two young people, both of whom work, fall in love and get married, they, on average, pay the Federal Government $1,400 a year in taxes for the right to be married. My wife is worth $1,400, but the point is, she ought to get the money, not the Government. We eliminate the marriage penalty. 
   Secondly, we have income splitting. Now, I know some of our Democrat colleagues are going to get up and say, well, look, if the husband earns all the money and the wife stays at home and raises the children, they ought not to get the correction for the marriage penalty. Well, we do income splitting. We have decided we don't want to inject the Tax Code in the decision about whether people work outside the home or not. My mama worked every day that I was a child, and she did it because she had to do it. My wife has worked every day that our children have been alive because she wanted to do it. I am not trying to distort the decision one way 
   or another, or make a judgment. All I am saying is that people who stay at home and raise their children contribute to America. They make a big contribution. By allowing a couple, where only one of them works outside the home, to split their income and attribute half to each one of them--that is what the partnership of marriage is about--we are able to give them a substantial reduction in the penalty they pay for being married. 
   The next provision is, we repeal the death tax, which is a certain kind of death penalty. I like the death penalty where we put murderers to death. I don't like the death penalty when working people die and we end up forcing their children to sell their business or their farm. All over America, people work a lifetime to build up a business or a farm, and then when they die, their children have to sell that business or sell that farm to give Government 55 cents out of every dollar they earned in a death tax. This provision repeals the death tax. 
   Now, I know that our Democrat colleagues are going to get up and say, well, these are rich people. But I want to give you an example. When I first met a printer from Mexia named Dicky Flatt, I met him about 25 years ago. He was in business with his daddy, who worked on these old calculator machines that businesses use. His mama kept all the books, his wife basically was working in their stationery shop, and Dicky Flatt did the printing business. They had an old building in Mexia, and it was cracking right down the middle. They kept putting sand in the bottom and kept tar-papering over the top. They had one bathroom, and it didn't have a door on it; it had a curtain on it. So when you went in to use the bathroom, you pulled the curtain. 
   Now, they worked hard in that business. So now Dicky Flatt has torn down that building. He has built a Morton building, a metal building, and he has a good size print shop and stationery shop. He sent his two sons to Texas A&M. They have come back and have gone into business with him. He works every day. He gets in at 6 and leaves about 8. He is there on Saturday until 6 o'clock. Whether you see him at the PTA, Boy Scouts, or the Presbyterian Church, try as he may, he never gets that blue ink off the ends of his fingers. 
   Now, Dicky Flatt may be rich, for all I know. He doesn't live like a rich guy. When his brother died of cancer, he took over his school supply business with his wife. My basic point is that Dicky Flatt and Linda, his wife, have worked 6 days a week their whole lives. They built up this business. Every penny they put into it has been in after-tax dollars. How can it be right to force their two boys, who now work in that business, to sell that business when Dicky and his wife Linda die in order to give the Government 55 percent of it, in order to take the money from Dicky Flatt and give it to people who have been sitting on their fannies in Mexia, not working on Saturday, and in some cases, not working at all? I am sure we are going to hear that this is for rich people. I want to put a human face on it. 
   When we revolted against King George, he wasn't doing things such as the death tax. This is an outrage. This is an assault on every value this country stands for, and I want to repeal it and repeal it outright. 
   I want to index the capital gains tax. 
   That is the fourth provision of this bill. 
   I want to say that from this day forward, if you buy a house as an investment and the price doubles and you sell the house for twice as much as you paid for it, you haven't made any money, you simply kept up with inflation. But under current tax law, you have to pay the Federal Government a capital gains tax on the doubling of your house's price even though that new price will buy only the amount of goods you could have bought with the money for which you bought the house. So the next thing we do is index the capital gains tax for inflation. 
   Finally, we eliminate not the last outrage in the Tax Code but it is a big  outrage. If General Motors buys you health insurance, it is tax deductible for them, but if you buy it for yourself, it is not tax deductible. We eliminate that by saying that no matter who buys health insurance in America, the employer or the employee, a retiree or a worker, a homemaker or someone who is employed in the economy, that health insurance is tax deductible. 
   It is a simple tax cut that you can put on one piece of paper. If you pay taxes, you are going to get a 10-percent reduction in income taxes out of this bill. It is easy to figure. If you pay $1,000 in income taxes, you are going to get $100. If you pay $10,000, you are going to get $1,000. If that breaks your heart, so be it. I think most people will like it. 
   Second, we eliminate the marriage penalty and we allow income splitting. If you have one parent who stays at home, you are able to divide the income in half and have each of them claim half that income that belongs to them. This is endorsed by every family group in America because it is the right thing to do. 
   We repeal the death tax outright over a 10-year period--no ifs, ands, or buts. If you live 10 more years, under this bill, and you build something with after-tax dollars, it belongs to your family forever. 
   That is simple arithmetic. I think we can all understand it. 
   We index the capital gains tax so that you never pay capital gains tax again on inflation. This is a big issue for every homeowner and for every investor in America. 
   Finally, we provide full deductibility of health insurance. This is an equity issue. It is something that ought to be done. 
   This is a tax cut you can understand. It represents what I believe is the vision of the party of which I am proud to be a member. I hope my colleagues will vote for this substitute. I believe it represents a dramatic improvement and simplification in the Tax Code. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in Ronald Reagan's own words, I want to take our Democrat colleagues down memory lane. They have such fond memories of what President Clinton has done, and I would like to tell the rest of the story. It is true that Bill Clinton was elected President. It is true that he came to Washington and proposed the largest tax increase in American history. It is true that not one Republican voted for that tax increase. It is true that it passed by one vote. It is true that the largest tax increase in American history now bears heavily on working Americans. 
   Everything else they said is not true. Let me try to explain why. They quote people saying harsh things about the Clinton program. Let me tell you the rest of the program. The rest of the program was a massive stimulus program where the Clinton administration proposed spending $17 billion, in 1993 alone, on everything from ice skating rink warming huts in Connecticut to alpine slides in Puerto Rico. I had harsh things to say about it, and I am proud of that. I am very proud that Republicans, who were in the minority, killed that bill with a filibuster. 
   Bill Clinton didn't just propose the largest tax increase in American history, he proposed having Government take over and run the health care system, collectivizing American medicine, forcing everybody into a Government-run health care collective, which was a giant HMO run by the Government. It would have meant Government taking over one-eighth of the American economy. I said it would be a disaster. I am proud that I helped lead the effort to kill it, and I am proud that it is dead where it belongs. That is the Clinton program. The point is, we were able to defeat every part of it, except the tax increase. 
   Now, when the Republican majority showed up in Washington, DC, in January of 1995, they received this budget from President Clinton. On page 2 of this budget, President Clinton outlines what his budget was. It had a deficit for fiscal year 1995 of $192 billion, and then the next year $196 billion, $213 billion, $196 billion, $197 billion, and $194 billion. That was the Clinton budget. 
   But we elected a Republican majority in Congress. What happened? With that Republican majority in Congress, we were not able to pass every bit of our Contract With America, but we reformed welfare, we cut spending, we stopped the runaway spending freight train of Bill Clinton. And under a Republican majority, while Clinton's deficits looked like this, the real deficit started to fall and turn into a surplus which is indicated on the chart. 
   The question is, Who led, who followed, and who got out of the way? I believe that the Republican Congress led, the Democrats in Congress followed, and Bill Clinton got out of the way. 
   So if we are going to tell the history of what happened in the Clinton era, let's not just remember his tax increase, let's remember his stimulus package, which we killed. The Democrat majority could not get 60 votes, and it died. Clinton was heartbroken, but it died. And we defeated the Clinton health care bill. It would have taken over one-eighth of the American economy, and Americans were so shocked at the Clinton program that they elected the first Republican majority since the 1950s. 
   When we took over, things changed. With the same old Bill Clinton who was here in 1995, when the deficit was $200 billion, what changed was the Republican majority. 
   I just say to the American people, give us a Republican President, and we will again control spending, and we will let working people have more of what they earn. 
   Mr. President, I yield Senator HAGEL 5 minutes off the amendment.

But it would be my intention, if it suits everybody else, to go ahead and try to answer all of these points that have been made, and try to deviate from my background as a schoolteacher and not take all day, and then go ahead and yield back my time if they would yield back theirs, and then we will set my vote aside and let Senator KENNEDY offer his amendment, if that will suit everybody on time. 
   The only thing I want to be sure of is--since I want to be sure I get to answer every point that has been made--I would like to be the last speaker on my substitute. So if that works with everybody, I am happy about it; if not, we can do it another way. 
   Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GRAMM. I will be through before that. Senator KENNEDY may want to start making his way over here. 
   Mr. President, we are about to wrap up the debate on this amendment. I think sometimes it is easy to get carried away and get in the business of trying to look at people's motives. I would like, in my concluding comments, to try to set this whole thing in perspective. 
   I wonder sometimes if our Democrat colleagues do not just rediscover every once in a while how progressive--and that is the term that was made up by the people who wanted the Tax Code to be highly skewed, where higher income people paid the great preponderance of taxes in America. 
   We are today talking about cutting income taxes. Our dear colleague from Minnesota points out that if you make less than $30,000, you are going to get less than $100 of income tax cuts in this bill. But what our colleague fails to recognize is that 50 percent of Americans pay only 4.3 percent of the income taxes; 32 percent of American families pay no income taxes whatsoever. 
   So I know it makes for a good sound bite to say 32 percent of Americans will get no income tax cut if you cut taxes across the board by 10 percent, but they do not get a tax cut because they do not pay income taxes. 
   Tax cuts are for taxpayers. The people who will get a tax cut under this bill get no food stamps. Is that an outrage? People who will get a tax cut under this bill do not qualify for Medicaid. Is that an outrage that they do not qualify for Medicaid? People who will get a tax cut under this bill do not qualify for Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Is anyone outraged about that? I am not, because AFDC, food stamps, Medicaid are not for everybody; they are for poor people. Tax cuts are for taxpayers. 
   So when our colleagues stand up and say the top one-quarter of the taxpayers in America will get 60 percent of the tax cut under this bill, don't forget that the top 25 percent of income earners in America today pay 81.3 percent of all the taxes. 
   Why would anybody be shocked that a group of people who pay 81.3 percent of the taxes might get 60 percent of the tax cut? In fact, what our dear colleague from Michigan was pointing out is that the Roth bill is, from the point of view of the existing Tax Code, putting a heavier burden on higher income people. My amendment does not do that. 
   Now, some of our colleagues, a few minutes ago, suggested that I was offering the House bill. The House tax cut bill is 457 pages long. The tax cut I am offering is 46 pages long. This is a very simple tax cut. At the end of my comments, I will go over what it does and does not do. 
   It is true that the top 1 percent will get more tax cut than the bottom 50 percent. The top 1 percent of income earners in America earn 16 cents of every dollar earned, but they pay 32.3 percent of the taxes. The bottom 50 percent pay only 4.3 percent of the taxes. So if you are giving a tax cut, people who pay taxes get it. If you are giving welfare or Medicaid, people who are poor get it. I don't know why that comes as a shock to our Democrat colleagues. 
   Our dear friend from South Carolina said the rich get it all. Well, the plain truth is that the average family in America making $50,000 a year, they are rich, according to the Senator from South Carolina. But the average family making $50,000 a year will get $624 in a tax cut by the 10-percent across-the-board tax. 
   How is it that only rich people are getting the tax cut? Well, you have to remember that when the Democrats, in 1993, raised taxes, they defined ``rich'' as anybody making over $25,000 a year when they taxed people earning $25,000 a year on their Social Security benefits. I hope people are not confused when they hear the Senator from South Carolina say under the Gramm amendment rich people get it all. I hope they understand that rich people are people over $25,000 a year. When Senator HOLLINGS was saying, yes, he voted to raise taxes on Social Security, that was on rich people who made over $25,000 a year. Don't forget the code when we are talking about these things. 
   There are a lot of people on the Democrat side of the aisle who say hold off on the tax cut. Well, I don't find that unappealing. Just to level with people, if we could stop the spending spree that is underway and hold off on the tax cut and have an election--I believe we are going to have a Republican President; I think I know who it is; I believe we are going to have a Republican majority in both Houses of Congress--I think we could do a better job 2 years from now. So when Senator LEVIN says hold off on the tax cut, why do I not end up supporting his position? 
   Well, the problem is, this is the Congressional Budget Office analysis of President Clinton's budget. He is proposing to spend $1.033 trillion, not only every penny of the surplus, but he is having to plunder Social Security for 3 out of the 10 years. So while our colleagues are saying don't cut taxes, what they are not telling is that the President has proposed spending every penny of the non-Social Security surplus, plus part of the Social Security surplus. 
   We are already $21 billion over the budget this year. I would be willing to wait when we had a President who I think would support a better tax package, but under President Clinton's budget, we will have spent every penny of the surplus before we can elect a new President. So that is why we have to act now. 
   The second thing is about how large this tax cut is, how outrageous, how obscene. If you want to spend all the money, any tax cut is obscene. If you don't want a tax cut, all tax cuts are for rich people, all tax increases are on rich people. So most people, at least in that language, don't have a stake in it. 
   But the problem is, all tax increases are on working people and our tax cut is for working people. The question is, Is it too big? 
   When Bill Clinton became President, Government was taking in taxes, 17.8 cents out of every dollar earned by every American. Because of the massive tax increase in 1993 and because  people, as incomes have gone up, have moved into higher brackets, Government is now taking a peacetime record 20.6 percent of the economy in Federal taxes. 
   Now, if we took all $1 trillion of the non-Social Security surplus and gave it back to the American worker in tax cuts--and I remind Senators, we are giving less than $800 billion because we are keeping $200 billion for Medicare and for emergencies--if we gave it all back, the tax burden, at 18.8 percent of every dollar earned, would still be substantially higher than it was the day Bill Clinton became President. So even if you adopt our tax cut and even if the President signed it, when he left office and when this tax cut was fully implemented, he could say: Taxes were substantially higher when I left than when I came--even though supposedly we are talking about a huge tax cut. 
   Now, finally, if you take the arithmetic and you say: How big is this tax cut relative to the level of taxes we are collecting, over a 10-year period, the tax cut is a whopping 3.5 percent. Over a 10-year period, if we adopt our tax cut, we are reducing revenues by 3.5 percent. 
   How can the President say this tax cut endangers the American economy? In fact, the day before yesterday he was saying it endangers women's health care; if we let working people keep more of the money they earn, it is going to hurt women's health. 
   I don't know, if this debate goes on another day or two, he may say that infantile paralysis will be back, that polio will suddenly descend on America. If you let people keep more of what they earn, it could happen. The bubonic plague could come back. The point is, we are talking about 3.5-percent tax cuts over 10 years. 
   Why are we doing this? We are doing it because we are going to collect $3 trillion in taxes over the next 10 years above the level we are going to spend. We are taking $2 trillion and putting it away so when we get a President that has the courage to fix Social Security--we do not have such a President today, I am sad to say, but when we get one, we will have the money and we will be ready to do it. 
   Then out of the trillion that is left, we are saying, let us give eight-tenths of it back in tax cuts and let us keep two-tenths of it for Medicare and for any emergencies we might have. 
   Our colleagues say, if you give these tax cuts, the money is gone forever. That is interesting because we raise taxes round here all the time. But yet when they spend this money on $1.033 trillion of new programs, it is as if we can snap our fingers and have it back. 
   The truth is, you can always get money back that you give to the American public in tax cuts. If we start 81 new programs, which is what President Clinton wants to do, we will never be able to get that money back. We will never be able to end those programs. That is what the debate is about. 
   I see that one of my colleagues who had asked to speak before, came and waited for others to speak, has come back. How much time do I have at this point?

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have worked up an example that I think tells the story here at the end of the debate. The question is, If we have a simple tax cut that cuts taxes across the board by 10 percent, eliminates the marriage penalty, repeals the death tax, indexes capital gains taxes, and gives a full deduction for health insurance, what will it mean to your family? 
   Obviously, it is easy to take how much taxes you pay and then take the 10 percent. Here is an example. Take this couple Senator HUTCHISON talked about, where you have a teacher and a football coach and they are married. Together, they make $70,000 a year. Now, I know there are some people on the other side of the aisle who are going to say they are rich. They have two children, and they might have one of them in college. If they have both of them in college, they are among the most financially stressed people in America. 
   But what would happen under this bill is that the 10 percent tax cut would mean that this family--a coach and a teacher, making $70,000 a year--would get an $800 tax cut; actually, it would be an $809 tax cut because of the 10 percent across-the-board cut; they would  get a $1,400 tax cut from the marriage penalty elimination, meaning, in total, they would get $2,200 in tax cuts. That is roughly, I think, what working middle America is about. 
   Mr. President, I yield all my time back.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Gramm amendment, No. 1405, be temporarily set aside in order for Senator KENNEDY to offer a motion relative to prescription drugs. I further ask consent that following the debate time on that motion, the Senate then proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Gramm amendment, No. 1405, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the Kennedy motion. I ask unanimous consent that no other amendments be in order to the amendment prior to the vote. I further ask consent that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding me so much time and for letting me speak last on our side as we begin the amendment process. 
   We have heard some awfully strong language here. Our colleague from West Virginia begs us not to give Americans back some of this money that we have taken from them in taxes. 
   We are projecting a $3 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. Nobody disputes that. We have before us a bill that would give about 25 cents out of every dollar of the projected surplus back to taxpayers. Our Democrat colleagues say: Please, don't do that. Our President is quoted in AP on July 25 as saying that our effort to give 25 cents out of every dollar of projected surplus over the next 10 years back to working people in tax cuts ``will imperil the future stability of the country.'' In fact, yesterday the President said it would hurt women's health care. Perhaps today it will be that it will bring back the bubonic plague. 
   But it is clear that the President is against giving back 25 cents out of every dollar of surplus--out of every dollar we are taking in above what the Government needs. He thinks giving back 25 cents out of every dollar is too much. 
   Our Vice President says that the tax cut before us is a ``huge, gigantic, risky tax scheme.'' 
   This is very extreme language we are hearing. Let me try to explain why it is so shrill. It is shrill for two reasons, really. 
   No. 1, giving people back their money so they can spend it themselves rather than Government spending it for them hardly seems extreme to the American people. With the projected surplus of $3 trillion, giving about one-fourth of it back in tax cuts hardly seems extreme. 
   But the other reason the President and his supporters are so shrill is, the President is not telling the truth. Let me explain why. 
   I have a chart here that has the cover page and one page of text of the analysis of what is called the Mid-Session Review. This is an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that was just completed of the President's budget; that is, what he proposes we do with the surplus, what the budget adopted by the Congress proposes we do with the surplus; and then it compares the two. The important point being, this is not me talking, this is not Bill Clinton talking, this is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office talking. 
   To listen to the President and to listen to our Democrat colleagues, you get the idea that this is a debate between cutting taxes and paying down debt. The problem is, that is not what the debate is about. This White House has turned misinformation into an art form. Here is the living proof of it. 
   In the analysis of the Mid-Session Review that was just published by the Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional Budget Office basically has two findings. One, while the President had initially proposed spending some of the Social Security surplus, we have so shamed the administration that they now have agreed with us that the roughly $2 trillion of surplus caused by Social Security should be set aside to either pay down debt or to fix Social Security. 
   It is interesting that we have voted many times on a lockbox procedure to require that that money not be spent, and we have been unable to get the support of the minority in making that the law of the land. But that is something that at least to this point we have agreed on. 
   Where the disagreement is--and the Congressional Budget Office shows it very clearly--is, what do you do with the non-Social Security surplus? Basically, what the Congressional Budget Office finds, that the administration desperately does not want anybody to know, is that their answer is, spend it. They are not paying down any debt with the nondefense discretionary surplus. In fact, over a 10-year period they spend every penny of it. And 
   they spend so much money in their budget that in 3 of the years they have to plunder the Social Security trust fund, basically, in contrast to what they have committed to do. 
   In fact, the Congressional Budget Office concludes, in looking at their own budget--and, again, this is the nonpartisan CBO--that in total, the President, over the next 10 years, would spend $1.033 trillion of the non-Social Security surplus, which is a little more than the entire surplus. 
   So when our colleagues are saying, don't give money back to taxpayers, pay down the debt, they are not talking about their program. The problem is, and the frustration is, if the President stood up and told the truth and said, don't give this money back to families, let me spend it, don't give this money back to working couples because they can't do as good a job spending it as the Federal Government could, then we could have a meaningful debate. But it is hard to have a meaningful debate because the administration basically is engaged in a concerted effort to mislead people. 
   But numbers and facts are persistent things. The Congressional Budget Office concludes two things about the Clinton budget that are devastating. No. 1, it would spend an additional $1.033 trillion more than the budget we have adopted and the spending caps to which the President is committed. 
   Secondly, and equally devastating, despite all this talk about buying down debt, with Chairman ROTH's tax cut, the budget adopted by Congress, which includes this tax cut, still pays down the Federal debt $219 billion more than the President's budget. Why? Because Senator ROTH's tax cut gives $792 billion back to working families. The President's budget spends $1.033 trillion. As a result, even after the tax cut, the Republican budget reduces debt held by the public by $219 billion more than the President's budget. 
   So his rhetoric is great. His sound bites are flawless. But the point is, he is not telling the truth. The reality is, the President proposes to spend every penny of the discretionary surplus on Government programs and plunders Social Security for additional money in 3 out of the next 10 years. 
   So the debate is not between reducing debt and cutting taxes. The debate is between letting Government spend the money or letting the taxpayer spend the taxpayer's own money. 
   But in addition to that, the tax cut that is being called ``huge,'' ``vulgar,'' ``dangerous,'' by President Clinton and his supporters is actually substantially smaller than the massive spending spree the President would take us on with 81 programs. 
   I ask you, how can it be more dangerous to start to cut taxes by $792 billion with a trillion-dollar surplus than it is to fund 81 programs and spend $1.033 trillion? Obviously, no one can argue that it is even equally dangerous. So what does the President do? He basically does not tell the truth. 
   Point No. 2, let's talk about: Why a tax cut now? 
   This chart really shows the highest 7 years in American history, in terms of the tax burden on working American families. The highest tax burden in American history by the Federal Government was in 1945 when Harry Truman was President. By the way, 38 cents out of every dollar earned in America is what we were spending on defense in 1945. That was the highest tax burden in American history. 
   The second highest tax burden in American history is today. Under President Clinton, in the year 2000--which is the budget year we are considering--the Federal Government will take 20.6 cents out of every dollar earned by every American. That is the second highest Federal tax burden in American history. 
   The third highest is under President Clinton in 1999. 
   The fourth highest was under President Clinton in 1998. 
   The fifth highest was under Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, when defense was 37 percent of the economy. 
   The sixth highest was under Bill Clinton in 1997. Hence, why we have on this chart ``Cause of Record Taxes: War and Clinton.'' 
   The seventh highest tax burden in American history was the day Ronald Reagan became President. What did we promptly do? We cut taxes by 25 percent. So we have never had, except  under President Clinton, tax levels approaching the level we have today. 
   Now, in terms of this ``dangerous'' tax cut, this is probably the most telling chart of all. The day Bill Clinton became President, the Federal Government was taking 17.8 cents out of every dollar earned by every American in Federal taxes. Today, we are near an all-time record of 20.6 cents out of every dollar earned by every American. Hence, since Bill Clinton has been President, with the 1993 tax increase as people have moved into higher tax brackets, the tax take on the American people has grown from 17.8 to 20.6 percent. 
   Now, if we took every penny of the non-Social Security surplus, which is $1 trillion, under current services, actually, bigger if you take a spending freeze, but if we took every penny of that, and we are not proposing that here--we are talking about $792 billion, not over $1 trillion--but if we took the entire trillion and gave it back in tax cuts, 10 years from now, when that tax cut is fully implemented, taxes would still be 18.8 percent of the economy, and taxes would still be substantially above where they were the day Bill Clinton became President. 
   So when he is calling this tax cut ``dangerous and huge,'' it is a tax cut that would not get us back, in terms of tax burden, to where we were the day Bill Clinton became President. It would still mean the tax burden during the Clinton administration, even with this tax cut, would have grown by more than in any modern Presidency. 
   Let me address the idea that this is a huge, dangerous tax cut. It is very interesting how people make up these things and nobody goes and looks it up. But let me give you some figures. 
   We are projecting next year, the first year of this tax cut, that revenues are going to be $1.9 trillion. We are going to collect that much in taxes. This tax cut next year is a whopping $4 billion. So out of $1.905 trillion of taxes we are going to collect, this would give $4 billion back. That is .21 percent. Now, that is the ``huge, dangerous'' tax cut about which we are talking. It is implemented over a 10-year period. But over that entire period, what is being called a ``dangerous'' tax cut would reduce taxes on the American people by 3.48 percent. So it is less than a 3.5-percent reduction in taxes, far less than President Clinton would increase government spending, I remind my colleagues, and somehow that is ``dangerous.'' 
   Well, it is dangerous if you are Bill Clinton, because if we give this money back to the American people, he can't spend it. There are 81 programs he would like to have that he won't get. What the President should be asking, rather than misleading people, is: Here are my 81 programs. This is what I am going to do for 
   you. I love you and this is what we are going to do for you. And we ought to be forced to say: We are going to give you this tax cut, and we are going to let you decide how to spend it. 
   The people could look at the President's 81 programs and look at our tax cut and they can say, ``I would rather President Clinton do it,'' or ``I would rather do it myself.'' That is the legitimate debate we ought to be having. But we are not having it because the White House continues to mislead the American public. 
   Let me make a few other points. Our colleagues keep talking about tax cuts for the rich. I have noticed there is a code here: Any tax cut is for the rich. Any tax increase is a tax on the rich. 
   So when the Democrats pushed through the largest tax increase in American history when they last had a majority, in 1993, that was a tax on the rich. Remember? Well, it raised taxes on gasoline for everybody. Do only rich people drive cars and trucks? I don't think so. It defined as ``rich'' anybody who made $25,000 a year or more because that is the tax it put on Social Security. Now, I don't know about some of the States that people may represent, but where I am from, $25,000 a year is not rich. But to our Democrat colleagues, obviously, since the Clinton tax increase was a tax on the rich, $25,000 in income made you rich. 
   According to them, our tax cut is for rich people. They get very excited about the fact that they have discovered when you cut taxes, people who don't pay income taxes don't get tax cuts. In fact, they will point out, I am sure a hundred times here, that 32 percent of American families pay no income taxes, which I personally think is an outrage. I think everybody ought to pay something. But 32 percent of American families pay no income taxes, and their obvious question is: Well, under your tax cut, 32 percent of families don't get a tax cut; how can that be fair? 
   Let me explain why it is fair. These taxpayers don't get food stamps, the great majority of them. They don't get Medicaid. And unless they are elderly, they don't get Medicare. They don't qualify for those programs. Our point is that tax cuts are for taxpayers. When we are cutting taxes, if you don't pay income taxes, you should not expect to get a tax cut. 
   Some of our colleagues would like you to believe the Roth package benefits the rich relative to the poor. Well, the plain truth is that the Roth package makes the tax system more progressive, not less progressive. Now, it is true that when you cut taxes, people who pay taxes get to keep more; people who don't pay taxes don't get a tax cut. But our colleagues have basically discovered that, over the years, we have made the tax code more and more and more progressive. In fact, today, the top 50 percent of income earners in America pay 99 percent of the income taxes. So is anybody surprised that, when the top 50 percent pay 99 percent of the income taxes, that when you cut income taxes, the top 50 percent tend to get more tax cuts? In fact, our colleagues like to rant and rave about across-the-board tax cuts by saying, well, a 10-percent tax cut means that Senator ROCKEFELLER, who pays at least 10 times as much in taxes as I do, would get 10 times as big a tax cut. 
   I am not offended by that. If he pays 10 times as much, and we have an across-the-board cut, he would get 10 times as big a tax cut. 
   Let me run over these figures real quickly so people understand. 
   The top 1 percent of income earners in America earn 16 percent of all the income earned, but they pay 32.3 percent of all the taxes. 
   The top 5 percent earn 30.4 percent of all the income earned, but they pay 50.8 percent of the taxes. 
   The top 10 percent earn 41.6 percent of the income earned, but they pay 62.4 percent of the taxes. 
   Should anybody be shocked when you cut taxes, when the upper 50 percent of American income earners pay 99 percent of the taxes, and they are going to get most of the tax cut? 
   Only our Democrat colleagues and the President would be outraged about that. Our view is that tax cuts are for taxpayers. 
   Who is rich? I decided to look at this top 50 percent of income earners and basically ask: Who are these rich people who the Democrats think should not get a tax cut? 
   Let me go down who they are. 
   They are the 50 percent of people who pay roughly 99 percent of the income taxes. 
   They are 62 percent of all homeowners in America. They are 66 percent of all people between the age of 45 and 64. They are 67 percent of all full-time workers in America. They are 68 percent of all workers who went to college. They are 69 percent of all married couples. And they are 80 percent of all two-earner households in America. 
   These are the people who the Democrats tell us are unworthy and should get no tax cut--that these are rich people and they deserve no tax cut. They pay 99 percent of the income taxes, but they deserve no tax cut. 
   Let me tell you what the code is. The Democrats are always for a tax increase, and the tax increase, no matter who it is imposed on, is always a tax on the rich. They are always against the tax cut, and the tax cut always goes to the rich, and that is basically the code. 
   When you break through the code, the code is they are for tax increases. They are not for tax cuts because they believe the Government can do a better job of spending your money than you can. 
   The final two points: We often hear from our colleagues that this is the worst tax cut since the Reagan tax cut of 1981. This is the worst tax since the Reagan tax cut. Do we want to do it again? 
   Let me remind my colleagues the day Ronald Reagan became President, an average family in America making  $50,000 a year was paying $12,626 in Federal income taxes. They were paying 25 cents out of every dollar they earned. Thanks to Ronald Reagan, today they are paying $6,242, or 12.5 percent. 
   The Democrats think that was terrible. This is the worst tax cut since Ronald Reagan. They must have liked the tax burden under Jimmy Carter. They must have liked the 21-percent interest rates under Jimmy Carter. They must have liked the 13 percent inflation rate under Jimmy Carter. But we had sense enough to end that policy and let working people keep more of what they earn. 
   Final point: Alan Greenspan's statements have become similar to the Bible--nobody reads them very closely, and everybody quotes them. They quote him on both sides of the argument. 
   I would like to let him speak for himself. I would like to do it in the context of what the President has proposed. 
   Alan Greenspan said:  
   If you find that as a consequence of those surpluses they tend to be spent, then I would be more in the camp of cutting taxes, because the least desirable is using those surpluses for expanding outlays.  
   When the President is proposing increasing spending by $1 trillion over the next 10 years, don't we find ourselves in a position where the surplus is being spent? 
   The answer is obviously, yes. It is being spent just as fast as it can be spent. 
   Then Alan Greenspan is in favor of giving part of it back--in this case a very conservative amount, 25 cents out of every dollar we have in surplus. 
   I think we should do it. I think it is the responsible thing to do. I believe we will do it. 
   If this is taking us back to the terrible days of lowering the tax burden, I am ready to go back.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think there are a lot of ways you can argue this point. The Byrd rule, as the distinguished Senator from Montana argued, is to try to protect us from provisions that have not been debated, provisions that have not been considered in committee, but provisions that show up in a reconciliation bill where we have rules that are distinctly different from the Senate rules, principally, that you have limited debate for 20 hours and that, therefore, you can't filibuster it and, therefore, you don't have to have 60 votes to pass it. 
   I am a supporter of the Byrd rule. I think it is a good rule, and I think it is a rule aimed at exactly the kind of offense that the Senator from Montana is talking about; that is, issues that have not been widely debated, issues that have not been considered in committee, and issues that have not had a full airing of public opinion. But can anybody argue that any one of those points applies to this tax bill? Does anybody here believe this tax bill has not had a full airing of public opinion? 
   The President, daily, issues some new statement. Yesterday, it was going to be the end of health care for women in America if we cut taxes. For all I know, by this afternoon there could be a new coming of the bubonic plague if we cut  taxes. Daily, the Vice President comments on it. 
   We have had a running debate now for weeks on this issue. We held extensive hearings in the Finance Committee on the issue. We held a markup. We have had extensive debate. Nobody in America has any doubt as to what we are doing in this bill. So my point is that all the reasons we have the Byrd rule, all the reasons that were adequately explained by the Senator from Montana, are good reasons to strike provisions from a reconciliation bill. And that is, if the provisions have not been widely discussed, if the public is not generally aware of them, if there have not been committee hearings and a markup on them, you don't want to give them the special privilege of being in a reconciliation bill. But surely I don't have to make a lengthy argument to convince people that none of those points apply here. 
   It is true that our Democrat colleagues, using this technicality, can force us to sunset this tax cut in 10 years. They can do it. And in doing so, we have the tax cut for 10 years. Nobody believes the Congress or the American people will just allow them to fall off the end of the Earth in 10 years. It is not the complete undoing of our tax cut if this point of order should be sustained. I don't know that it would be of great practical importance. But I simply say that on an issue that is the No. 1 issue in the country, on an issue that has been extensively debated, on an issue where we held hearings and a markup, on an issue where every American knows the subject is being debated--it is referred to on a minute-by-minute basis on most of the major outlets for news in America--there is no logic to sustaining this point of order. 
   I really see this as creating instability in the Tax Code. It wasn't our intention to raise a similar point of order against the Democrats' bill. Basically, it seems to me they have a right to propose a permanent tax cut. We could have raised a point of order against such a tax cut if it had been proposed. We would not have done it--basically believing they ought to have a chance to say to the Nation what their vision is. We know their vision. They want to spend this money and they don't want to give it back. It is perfectly legitimate; I just don't agree with it. 
   I hope our Democrat colleagues will not take this technicality as an opportunity to create a Tax Code that is in effect for 10 years and, at the end of 10 years, it goes away. I think it is unstable. I think it is an irresponsible way of doing it. I don't object. The minority has the right to do this. If we can't get 60 votes, they have every right under the rule to do it. It doesn't undo our tax cut. It is not the end of the world. It certainly makes what we are doing still of great importance. 
   I argue to those who have not hardened their hearts to a tax cut to allow us to have a permanent tax cut. If you are not for it, vote against it. We are willing to let you offer a permanent tax cut. So that is really the issue. The Byrd rule technically applies to this provision, but the logic of it does not apply. Therefore, I argue that we should waive the point of order, and that is going to take 60 votes. There are 55 Republicans, so if every Republican voted to waive it, we would have to get five Democrats. My argument is, if you are against the tax cut, great; it is perfectly legitimate to be against it. But don't use a technicality to try to undermine a legitimate proposal, which has been debated extensively, which is known to virtually everybody who hasn't been hiding under a rock for the last 6 months; don't use a provision of law that is really aimed at preventing extraneous material from getting into the bill to undermine basically, at least today and tomorrow, and I think for a long time, the No. 1 issue in the country. I hope our Democrat colleagues who are not just hell-bent against a tax cut will vote to waive this point of order so we don't have the absurdity of adopting a tax cut and have it temporary and have it end in 10 years. 
   Hopefully, we are going to have an opportunity to improve this during 10 years. I am still for it if it is sunset in 10 years. But I don't think this is good policy, and I urge my colleagues to rise above the politics of the moment and vote for good policy. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators LOTT and MCCONNELL in introducing the New Workers for Economic Growth Act, which will increase the number of H-1B temporary work visas used by U.S. companies to recruit and hire foreign workers with very specialized skills, particularly in high technology fields. In addition, the legislation eliminates the reduction in Social Security benefits now imposed on individuals aged 65 through 69 who continue to work and whose earnings exceed $15,500 annually. This bill will ensure that the U.S. economic expansion will not be impeded by a lack of skilled workers. 
   With record low unemployment, many U.S. companies have been forced to slow their expansion, or cancel projects, and may be forced to move their operations overseas because of an inability to find qualified individuals to fill job vacancies. We will achieve our full economic potential only if we ensure that high-technology companies can find and hire the people whose unique qualifications and specialized skills are critical to America's future success. 
   Last year, the Congress increased temporarily the number of annual H-1B visas from 65,000 to 115,000 for Fiscal Years 1999 and 2000, and to 107,500 in 2001. The number of H-1B visas is scheduled to drop back to 65,000 for Fiscal Year 2002 and subsequent years. The New Workers for Economic Growth Act will increase the H-1B visa cap to 200,000 for Fiscal Years 2000, 2001 and 2002. By the end of that period, we will have the data we need to make an informed decision on the number of such visas required beyond 2002. The bill retains the language of current law which protects qualified U.S. workers from being displaced by H-1B visa holders. 
   According to a recent study by the American Electronics Association (AEA), Texas has the fastest growing high technology industry in the country and is second only to California in the number of high technology workers. This legislation will ensure that these companies have access to highly skilled, specialized workers, in order that such businesses can continue to grow and prosper, and in doing so, create jobs and opportunity for U.S. workers. 
   Additionally, our bill expands work opportunities for America's retired senior citizens by removing the financial penalty which is now imposed on those who choose to continue to work while receiving Social Security and whose wages exceed specified levels. The Social Security earnings test robs senior citizens of their money, their dignity, and their right to work, and it robs our Nation of their talent and wisdom. I believe that this legislation represents a fair and effective way to address a critical need in our Nation's economy, and I hope my colleagues will quickly approve this important proposal.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Senator DOMENICI and I are here to talk about the tax cut, but I cannot listen to our dear colleague from West Virginia without giving a little bit of response. 
   First of all, I agree with virtually everything the Senator from West Virginia has said. I do believe we tread on our institution and we potentially reduce its ability to preserve our freedom and our Republic when we engage in  partisan politics. I agree with virtually every word Senator BYRD said. 
   We all know we have used the appropriations process to offer amendments that were not part of any national agenda, that did not represent any real debate on behalf of causes, but in many cases both parties have engaged in the kind of politics where the minority--and that minority changes sides from time to time. I hope that will not occur in the future, but knowing institutions as I do, I am sure it will. What happens is, too often, the minority delays the work of the majority, and then at the time for electioneering accuses the majority of not getting its work done. If we ought to preserve this great institution and all we love about it and all it stands for for America, one of the things we have to do is to prevent partisan abuse of the system. 
   When we voted to overturn the Chair now several years ago, I was very reluctant to overturn the Chair. I found myself in a position of having a colleague who had offered an amendment with which I strongly agreed and who also was in a position where it was critically important to her to see the Chair overturned. I knew no good could come out of it. I thought it would be easier to fix than it has turned out to be. I intend to vote to fix it today. 
   I do not believe we ought to be legislating on appropriations bills. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia is correct in that it has become so easy for the authorization process to be disrupted that we have virtually trivialized authorizations. Authorization committees often go an entire term without having any kind of authorization bill passed. Legislation builds up, we end up putting it on appropriations bills, and in doing so, we also hurt the institution. 
   I have heard every word our colleague from West Virginia has said. I believe we do need to set a threshold for offering legislation on an appropriations bill. It can be overcome with 51 votes. But every Member has to know that when they do that, when they overrule the Chair, they open that avenue for anyone else to do it in the future. In doing so, we take down a small shield which I think is as big as it needs to be, because there are times when the minority deserves the right to speak, and if they feel strongly enough about it and they can convince a majority to do it, they have a right to do it. 
   I intend to vote today to put rule XVI back into place. I do not intend to be in any hurry to see it pulled down again because it is a very good and important barrier.

   Mr. GRAMM. I do not believe I will. It is something that should be looked at. I remind our colleague from Nevada that our effort today is not to change the rules of the Senate but to put 
   the rules back where they were before we overrode the Chair on the endangered species provision to an appropriations bill, now several years ago. 
   Senator BYRD has raised a critically important issue. Too much work is done in conference. Anyone who has ever chaired a conference--and I am relatively new at it as a new committee chairman--immediately discovers that the only rule of the conference is you have to get a majority of the members to sign the conference report. Other than that, for all practical purposes, there are no rules. 
   This should be looked at, but I am not ready today to change the rules of the Senate. I am ready to go back and undo a mistake that we made some 4 or 5 years ago. I will be willing to look at this. I will be willing to study it, to participate in a discussion about it. We ought to hold hearings on it and look at it, but I am not ready to overturn the rules of the Senate today.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about taxes. I want to deviate from my background in schoolteaching to be brief because I have to run over for a 2:30 meeting on the banking bill and I want to hear a little bit of what the Senator from New Mexico has to say before I leave. 
   We are beginning a debate that is a very proper and important debate. I am frustrated in this debate because, in trying to discuss this issue with the White House, we have a concerted effort on their part to try to confuse the issue and mislead the American people as to what the choices are. 
   I want to direct my comments to the choice we face. Basically, we have the great and good fortune of having two things that have occurred at the same time. No. 1, beginning in the mid-1980s we started the process of gaining control over spending. It was not a dramatic change in policy, but over the years we have seen a gradual slowdown in the rate of growth in Government spending, beginning in the mid-1980s. 
   In the early 1990s we started to see an explosion of productivity as modern technology became incorporated in the workplace in America, and the result has been rapid economic growth and, with that economic growth, a growth in Federal revenues. We therefore have a situation which anyone would dream of having during their period of service in public life, and that is, we have a very large budget surplus. 
   Initially, the President proposed spending part of the surplus that comes from Social Security. I am proud to say that Senator DOMENICI, I, and others rejected that, and finally the President reached an agreement with us, in the best spirit of bipartisanship, that we were not going to spend the Social Security trust fund. 
   We are trying to lock that into law in the so-called Social Security lockbox. We have an agreement with the President on the principle. We have not reached an agreement with the President and with the minority party in the Senate on exactly how to lock it up, but we are working on that. 
   The debate we are beginning today is a debate about what to do with the surplus that comes from the general budget that does not come from Social Security, and, try as they may at the White House to confuse the issue and to mislead the public, there really are two stark choices being presented to the American people. 
   The first choice is presented by the President and his administration. In regard to what is called the President's mid-session review, the Congressional Budget Office, which is the nonpartisan budget arm of the Congress, reviewed both the Republican budget and the budget submitted by the President. They concluded that the President's budget proposes $1.033 trillion worth of new Government spending on approximately 81 new programs, above and beyond increases for inflation. 
   That $1.033 trillion of new spending that the President's budget has proposed is so big that it not only uses up, for all practical purposes, the non-Social Security surplus, but in 3 of the next 10 years it will require plundering the Social Security trust fund or running an outright non-Social Security deficit because the level of spending is too big. 
   As an alternative, Republicans have proposed that out of the $1 trillion non-Social Security surplus, we give $792 billion back to the working people of America who sent the money to Washington to begin with and that we keep $200 billion plus to meet the basic needs of the country and to meet uncertainties we might face. 
   That is a pretty clear choice. The President's budget says spend $1.033 trillion on new Government programs. That is how they would use the non-Social Security surplus. Our proposal says, take about 80 percent of it and give it back to working people in broad tax cuts and keep 20 percent of it to meet critical needs and to deal with contingencies. 
   If that were the debate we were having, Republicans might be winning the debate, we might be losing the debate, but we would be having a meaningful debate. The problem is, the administration continues to mislead the American public and basically to claim they are not proposing to spend this money. While proposing $1 trillion of new spending, they say that, by giving less than $800 billion back to the public in tax cuts, in the words of the President, we ``imperil the future stability of the country.'' This is quoting the President at a fundraiser, naturally, in Colorado, that by giving this $800 billion back in tax cuts, we ``imperil the future stability of the country.'' Yet to spend $1.033 trillion on new programs, the President would do wonderful things for the country. 
   If the President were honest enough to stand up and say, Don't let Senator DOMENICI, don't let Senator LOTT, don't let Senator GRAMM give this money back to working people, let me spend it, I would have no objections to the debate. But I have to say that it begins to grate on a person when day after day after day this administration says things that are verifiably false with a level of dishonesty in public debate that is without precedent in the history of this country. No administration in debate on public policy has ever been as dishonest as this administration is. When you look at the actual numbers in their budget and then listen to what they are saying, it is as if  we are talking about two totally separate budgets.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me make a point that I think goes right to the heart of the statement by the President that something is extreme about our fairly modest tax cut. I have a chart here that I wish every American could see and understand. It shows the percentage of the economy that was coming to Government the day Bill Clinton became President. 
   The day Bill Clinton became President, the Government was collecting in taxes 17.8 cents out of every dollar earned by every American. As you will recall, in 1993, we had a very big tax increase, and with the growth in the economy, the Government is now taking in 20.6 percent of every dollar earned by every American. If we took the entire surplus--not the $794 billion being proposed by Republicans, but the whole $1.33 trillion, or whatever it is--if we took the whole surplus, which we are not proposing to do, and gave it back in a tax cut, 10 years from now, when it was fully implemented, the Federal Government would still be taking 18.8 percent of every dollar earned in taxes, which is substantially more than it was the day Bill Clinton became President. 
   So what Bill Clinton is calling a ``dangerous, huge tax cut'' is actually a  relatively modest tax reduction as compared to the tax increase and revenue growth that has occurred in the 6 1/2 years that Bill Clinton has been President, even if we cut taxes by the amount of the entire surplus, which we are not proposing to do. But even if we did, the tax burden would still be higher than it was the day Bill Clinton became President. That is a point I think people need to understand.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I guess, despite the rules of the Senate, we all have our own rules that we apply to ourselves about what we say. 
   One of the problems is that if one side of the debate insists on getting up and saying things that are verifiably false, we end up with a shouting match going back and forth. 
   Our bill guarantees access to emergency care. Our bill guarantees that any woman at any point at any time can get access to an OB/GYN physician. Our bill deals with people under the Federal jurisdiction because the States have already done a very good job in dealing with the people under their jurisdiction which they cannot reach without Federal action. 
   We have talked at great length. Our colleagues keep saying this bill cost $2 a month. The problem is that the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan budgeting arm of the Congress, says this bill will cost $72.5 billion, this bill will take insurance away from 1.9 million Americans, and this bill will end up driving up costs for Americans who are able to keep their insurance. 
   Obviously, anyone who follows the debate around here realizes that Democrats aren't very much worried about cost. But why are we so worried? 
   No. 1, we are worried about 1.9 million people losing their insurance. We believe we can fix what is wrong with HMOs, and do it without driving up medical costs so much that people lose their health insurance. 
   But I would like to make two final points which I think are critical to this entire debate. If you came from outer space this morning and you listened to our Democratic colleagues, you would think they are opponents of HMOs. But let me read for you from congressional debate on February 10, 1978. I quote:  
   I authored the first program of support for HMOs ever passed in the Senate. The Carter administration has made the promulgation of HMOs one of its major goals. Clearly HMOs have done their job in proving themselves a highly desirable mechanism for medical care delivery.  
   That is Senator TED KENNEDY. That is not PHIL GRAMM. 
   Our Democrat colleagues are the fathers and the mothers of HMOs. Yet today they have decided to vilify an institution they created. Rather than fixing the problems that exist, they have decided, for political reasons, it would be basically a good idea to destroy HMOs. 
   Why are we concerned about destroying the private health care system? Why are we so concerned about cost? The reason we are so concerned about cost, the last time we had double-digit health care inflation, the Democrats and President Clinton sent a health care bill to Congress, the Clinton health care bill, that would have had the Government take over and run the health care system, a bill that would have required every American to buy their health care through a Federal health care collective. 
   Today, our Democrat colleagues are very concerned about ``medical necessity.'' We have heard them talk about it all day long. When we open the Clinton health care bill, which they supported, on page 86, it mentioned ``medical necessity'' under exclusions. Let me read their solution to the problem of medical necessity when they wanted the Government to take over and run the health care system. 
   Their bill says, on page 86, line 10, under ``Exclusions'':  
   Medical necessity. The comprehensive benefit package does not include any item or service that the National Health Board may determine is not medically necessary.  
   Today, our dear Democrat colleagues are all concerned about ``medical necessity,'' but when they wanted the Government to take over and run the health care system they defined medical necessity as whatever the National Health Board determined it to be, and the National Health Board was the Federal Government. 
   Today, our colleagues have gone on and on about medical access and point of service. When the inflation rate on health care was above double digit and they proposed having the Government take over the health care system, do you know what their point of service option was? If you didn't join the Government plan, you got fined $5,000. The choice they provided in their point-of-service option is if the doctor who had to work for the Federal Government provided care he felt you needed but their Government health board felt you didn't need, he got fined $50,000 for doing that. If he provided a service they didn't allow and you paid privately for it, the physician could go to prison for 15 years. 
   Now, the same people who proposed all these things and came within a heartbeat of forcing Americans into this totalitarian system because they wanted to deal with inflation and access, today they are proposing legislation that would drive the inflation rate up by 6.1 percent and would, by Congressional Budget Office numbers, force 1.9 million people to lose their health insurance. 
   Why are we so concerned about starting runaway medical inflation again? Part of it is because we care about the people who lose insurance. Part of it is because we care about the $72.5 billion in costs for people who get to keep their insurance. But a lot of it is because we remember what Bill Clinton and the Democrats wanted to do the last time we had runaway medical inflation. 
   I am sorry, but I have a very hard time listening to my Democrat colleagues talk about medical necessity when only a few years ago they proposed to let Government define what medical necessity was, and if their board didn't say it was necessary, you didn't get it. I have a very hard time listening to them talk about a point-of-service option when virtually every one of them supported and cosponsored a bill that would have put a physician in prison for 15 years for providing a service that their Government board said was not needed. 
   In listening to our colleagues, it's easy to forget their support of legislation for the last 25 years that created HMOs. One forgets they love HMOs so much that they tried in 1994 to force every American into an HMO run by the Government. And one forgets that  they were so concerned about patients rights they let the National Health Board determine what was medically necessary with no review whatever, and they put a doctor in prison for 15 years if he didn't comply with their rules. 
   There is a certain disconnect between what they are saying today and what they have proposed in the past. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, one of the frustrating things about this debate is that when facts are established, our dear colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to use information that has no foundation in fact and which, in fact, is at variance with the facts. So what I would like to do is to go through and present the facts, not as I would like to make them up, or as our colleagues may have made them up, but the facts in terms of the findings of the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan arm of Government which does estimates on the basis of which we run Government. 
   First of all, the CBO estimate which I have here says that the ultimate effect of the Kennedy bill would be to increase premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance by an average of 6.1 percent. That is not my number, that is the number of the Congressional Budget Office. That converts into $72.7 billion of costs that will be borne by companies that pay insurance and employees that often match that expenditure. 
   Senator KENNEDY has made headlines by saying we are talking about a hamburger a month. The reality is that the estimate of the Kennedy bill by Congressional Budget Office is enough money to buy every franchise of McDonald's in America. It is estimated that this cost will mean that 1.8 million Americans will lose their health insurance. That is 1.8 million people who won't have access to health care at least paid for by insurance of any kind. 
   Our colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle don't seem very concerned about 1.8 million people losing their health insurance. But we are very concerned. We looked at public opinion strategies nationwide poll of small businesses which asked what they would do if the Democrat bill were adopted and you could sue not only the HMO, or the health care provider, but sue the company that bought the insurance policy. The responses indicated that 57 percent of small businesses in America say that they either would be very likely to drop health insurance coverage, that is 39 
   percent, or somewhat likely, 18 percent. That is 57 percent of the insurance for some 70 percent of the working people in America that would be jeopardized by this bill. Yet, over and over and over again, we hear this talk as if there are no costs involved. 
   Now our colleagues go on and on as if repeating something would make it true, by saying that their bill covers 161 million people and our bill covers 48 million people. The way Federal law and State law is structured, the federal government has jurisdiction over 48 million people in terms of health insurance under a Federal law called ERISA. My State has passed a comprehensive health care Bill of Rights. Maybe Senator BOXER would not support their Bill of Rights, but Senator BOXER would not be elected in Texas. I might not support the Bill of Rights in California, but I probably would not be elected in California. 
   The point is, who elected Senator BOXER to write health care policy for State insurance in Texas? Nobody in Texas elected her. Nor did they elect me for that purpose. If I wanted to write State insurance policy in Texas, I would have run for the Texas senate and not the U.S. Senate. 
   So we have this absurdity that is stated over and over again that they are covering more people than we are. We are covering the people in America who are under Federal jurisdiction. They are preempting State law in every State in the Union, and Senators  who have never been to some States in the Union are dictating to them about the jurisdiction of their legislature. Yet, somehow it is suggested that I don't care about people in Oklahoma. I care about people in Oklahoma so much that if the State has the power to write their own health care Bill of Rights--which they do in Oklahoma--I want them to write it. That is how much I care about them. But in that area where it is Federal jurisdiction, I want us to write it. 
   In terms of continuity of care, if there has ever been any debate in history that could be referred to as somewhat contradictory of a previous position, it is this. I want to remind my colleagues who today aren't concerned about a 6.1-percent increase in the cost of health insurance, who aren't concerned about 1.8 million people losing their health insurance, who in 1994 they were so concerned about double-digit health inflation--an inflation rate we would match if their bill passed, they were so concerned that they wrote the Clinton health care bill. And they were so concerned about medical necessity that when they wrote it, here is what their medical necessity was:  
   The comprehensive benefit package does not include an item or service that the national health board may determine is not medically necessary.  
   Today they are jumping up and down about medical necessity. They want a doctor to choose. They want us to write in our bill that we are going to let the Federal Government define it. But when they wrote their health care bill in 1994, they said that a national board would decide. 
   They talk about point-of-service option. But when they wrote their health care bill, if you didn't join their health care collective, you would be fined $5,000. If your doctor prescribed a health treatment that was not approved by the Clinton administration, your doctor would be fined $50,000. And if they provided a health service that wasn't prescribed and you paid for it, your doctor could go to jail for 15 years. 
   Now, that is how much they cared about all these things when they were trying to put America under socialized medicine. They were trying to do it because people were losing health insurance, because costs were going up. 
   Yet today they are trying to pass a bill that would drive costs up and that would deny people their health insurance. 
   Having spent all of this time answering all of this misinformation, let me spend the rest of my time saying a few things that I feel strongly about. 
   No. 1, I have never been prouder of the Republican majority than I am today. I have never seen greater collective political courage than I have seen today. 
   It would be very easy with all of this demagoguery about insurance companies, HMOs, health, consumers, and charts showing scores of HMO's 12, consumers 0. 
   I remind you that our Democrat colleagues invented HMOs. TED KENNEDY in 1978 said:  
   I authored the first program of support for HMOs that passed the Senate. Clearly HMOs have done their job.  
   What is TED KENNEDY saying today? He loved them so much that he wanted to put the whole Nation under one run by the government. But, today, he is trying to kill HMOs. 
   We are not trying to kill HMOs. I am not ashamed of that. 
   I want to give people a choice so that if they don't want to be in HMOs they can get out. We broaden their options. We give people the right to fire an HMO. 
   Senator KENNEDY gives people the right to sue one. We guarantee people the right to see a doctor. He guarantees the people the right to see a lawyer. 
   I am proud, when it has been so easy to demagogue this issue, that we have stood up for the interests of this country. 
   We have written a very good bill. It cleans up the things in HMOs that needed to be cleaned up. But it doesn't kill off the only mechanism we have to control costs. 
   We provide tax deductibility for the self-employed. That will mean millions of people will get health insurance that do not have it today. 
   We let people have medical savings accounts--a new, innovative way to let people choose their own doctor and control costs at the same time. 
   I am proud of what we have done. It is easy to demagogue, but it is hard to lead. We have led, and America is going to benefit from our leading. 
   Finally, let me say we have come forward with a bill that works--a bill that works for people, a bill that holds down costs, a bill that promotes equality. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have to take exception to the comments that Senator KENNEDY made. I am not trying to get into an argument, but as anyone who has followed this debate knows, for 2 years we have offered the Democrats the ability to bring up their bill. Then we would bring up our bill and let the Senate choose. The Democrats dictated the format we are debating under, and they would not allow us to pass an appropriations bill until they got exactly the procedure they have today. Now that they have exactly the procedure that they dictated by holding the Senate up, they are unhappy with the procedure. 
   Might I also say, with all of these cries of partisanship, not one Democrat voted for any amendment offered by any Republican yesterday or Monday. Now, I don't understand bipartisanship as existing when Republicans vote to let the Government take over the health care system and to bring lawyers into the system rather than doctors but it is somehow not bipartisan when Democrats refuse to vote for our proposals. You can't have it both ways.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have heard, for the last hour, in almost tearful terms, our colleagues talk about how in the amendment they now have before us ``we are down to the heart of what separates the two parties.'' 
   Well, I don't know whether it is the heart, or the lungs, or the liver, but we are sure down to what separates the two parties. Our colleague from Massachusetts has a sign that talks about how we are not protecting Tennessee. That is interesting because Tennessee protected itself by electing one of the Nation's premier physicians to represent them in the Senate and to become the Nation's foremost spokesman  on health care. Yet Senator KENNEDY believes he is somehow here to protect the people of Tennessee. I don't think they elected Senator KENNEDY. I think they elected Senator FRIST. I think they elected him because he does represent their views. 
   What is in this amendment that is supposed to be the heart of what defines the two parties? Well, it is very interesting. It is about two things. No. 1, they want to raise taxes about $5 billion. That does define the difference between the two parties. Whether it is the heart of the difference, or some other body part, I don't know. But the first thing that is different--and they are speaking in such passionate, tearful tones about it--is they want to raise taxes by $5 billion on this amendment. 
   So to take them at their word, if you want to know the difference between the two parties, the difference between the two parties is that they, by their own words and deeds and amendments, are the party that wants to raise taxes in the Senate. The tax burden is at the highest level in American history, but it is not high enough to suit them. They want $5 billion, and they want to take it $50 per household in America, and they want it in this amendment. That is the first thing they say defines the heart of the difference between the two parties. 
   The second thing they say defines the heart of the difference--and I agree with them--is that when they read the Constitution, they quit reading too soon because what the Constitution says in the tenth amendment is that those powers not specifically delegated to the Federal Government are reserved for the States and for the people. 
   Why is that relevant? Why it is relevant is, despite all the efforts to confuse people, under existing law, the States regulate insurance. There is a Federal statute that carves out between 40 and 50 million insurance policies where the companies actually underwrite the policies--a law called ERISA--where the Federal Government in these circumstances established its primacy and its jurisdiction so that the State legislature of Tennessee, and the State legislature of Texas, and the State legislature of all the States in the Union are prohibited from legislating in these ERISA plans where the company assumes liability for the insurance. 
   What we have done in our bill is, where the States can't reach, we have passed a bill that guarantees patients' rights, including the one right the Democrats preclude. The Democrats will let a patient look in the phone books' Blue Pages and call the Government if they are unhappy with an HMO, and they will let them look under ``attorneys'' in the Yellow Pages and hire an attorney if they are unhappy with an HMO; but the Democrats don't give them the freedom to fire the HMO. We give them that freedom. 
   Now, we have written a bill that is aimed at dealing with the part of this problem that comes under the Federal Government. Our 
   Democrat colleagues are very unhappy because they want a national health plan. They believe Senator KENNEDY and President Clinton know everything there is to know about health care, that Dr. FRIST knows nothing about health care, and they would like to write health care policy for Texas. 
   Now, they want to do it without the inconvenience of having to move to Texas, pay taxes in Texas, and run for office in Texas. They want to assume that if you are elected to the Senate from Massachusetts, that allows you to tell people in Tennessee how insurance ought to be regulated, and that allows you to tell people in Texas how things ought to be. Now, Texas has already passed a comprehensive patients' bill of rights, but that doesn't stop those elected to the Senate from some other State from the right to come in and say to Texas: You don't know what you are doing, you don't know anything about health care, and you don't care about the people of Texas. 
   Having been elected in Massachusetts, they care about people from Texas; but they believe the people in the senate and the house of the Texas Legislature are somehow deficient in caring to suit them. So the second thing they differ on is that while States throughout the Union have tried to tailor their programs to meet their individual needs, the Democrats would have us say: Take everything Texas has done, everything Maine has done, everything the 43 States have enacted, and the other States that are about to act, and throw it in the trash can because all wisdom emanates from Washington. 
   So this ``heart'' of the difference between the two parties that we have been listening to for an hour really boils down to two differences. They want to raise taxes by another $50 per family on the amendment they just offered and they want to say to States: We are going to take away from you a right that has been historically guaranteed under Federal law and under the tenth amendment to the Constitution, which allows States, in the area of insurance where they regulate, to state their own policy, to decide what kind of policies they want operating within their own State borders. 
   Our colleagues have decided taxes are too low and that we don't have enough Federal regulation. So what they would do is attempt to substitute Federal mandates for what our Texas Legislature has decided, which would be dictated and enforced by Federal bureaucrats. 
   With all due respect, who is doing a poorer job than HCFA in regulating health care in America? Who is doing a poorer job than we are doing at the Federal level? 
   Our approach is an approach which says where we have responsibility, where only we can deal with a problem, we have put together a comprehensive program that makes sense. Granted, we didn't do a public opinion poll; we didn't get together focus groups and try to say if you ran a 30-second TV ad on this subject, would people tend to agree with it? We have Dr. FRIST. We have SUSAN COLLINS. We have JIM JEFFORDS. We sat down for over a year with people who knew something about the problem and we wrote a bill we believe people will be glad we wrote 10 years from now. But the reality is that there are two differences Democrats want to highlight today. There are two things they claim represent the heart of what separates the two parties. 
   They believe taxes ought to be higher. So they raise taxes by $5 billion with this amendment. 
   Second, they don't believe that Maine ought to set its health policy. These people in Maine don't understand health, and they don't care about people in Maine. Only people in Massachusetts care about people in Maine. Only people in Massachusetts care about people in Texas. And we don't understand it. 
   They are right. We don't understand it. We don't accept it. We reject it. 
   If the best they can do in telling us what is right with them and what is wrong with us is that they want higher taxes and they want to tell every State in the Union how to run health care, they are going to be in the minority a very long time. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to come over today and try to end this debate by making a point this debate has cried out for all day. 
   What we have heard all day long is our Democrat colleagues stand up and attack HMOs. Every horror story they could imagine, every outrage that the human mind could conceive, they have talked about and laid at the doorstep of HMOs. I think someone watching this debate who just got off a turnip truck or who just emerged from a 10-year trip to outer space would believe that our Democrat colleagues hate HMOs and that they are the enemies of HMOs. 
   But let me remind those who may have just gotten off a turnip truck, or those who may have forgotten what has occurred in America in the last 20 years that you have been listening all day to the fathers and mothers of HMOs. They brought HMOs into Federal statutes. They exempted them from health planning. 
   They liked HMOs so much that in 1994 they sent this bill to the Congress. 
   For those who have forgotten it, this is the Clinton health care bill. The Clinton health care bill, which our colleagues who spoke today all supported and uniformly loved, forced every American to go into an HMO that was set up as a local health care cooperative. It was an HMO run by the Government with all the compassion of the IRS and with all of the efficiency of the post office. 
   They loved HMOs so much and they were so confident in them that they said: If you refuse to join your local health cooperative, HMO, Government-run health care system, we are going to fine you $5,000. 
   That was their position in 1994. 
   Now they have taken a poll. They have done a focus group. They do not love HMOs anymore. But in 1994 they loved them so much that they were going to fine every American $5,000 for refusing to join their Government-run HMO. 
   By the way, they banned suing the HMO when it was their HMO, when it was the Government HMO. They thought we ought not to do it. 
   Today they are worried about doctors providing care, and that for a doctor under an HMO, they can't do it. But when they were writing their health care bill, they fined a doctor $50,000 if he provided health care that their Government-run health care cooperative, HMO, did not allow. 
   So under this bill, when you had a health care collective run by the Government--one great big HMO, and if a doctor prescribed a medicine that they didn't allow, or prescribed a treatment, or provided a treatment that they didn't think was medically necessary, that is Dr. Clinton or Dr. Kennedy didn't think was necessary, a doctor could be fined $50,000 under this bill. 
   If your baby was really sick and they banned the treatment, and if I went to Dr. FRIST and I said, Dr. FRIST, I want my child to have this surgery, I know you can do it, I know that our Government collective HMO bans it, but I am willing to pay you for it, if Dr. FRIST had taken that payment, he would have gone to prison for 15 years under the Clinton health care bill. 
   These are the people who invented the HMO. They are the people who love HMOs. They are the people who wanted to put us under an HMO and fine us $5,000 for not giving it our money, and it put a doctor in prison for 15 years for violating their statute on what they thought was good medicine. 
   Today it has been a horror show about HMOs. 
   I want to conclude. I know people want to go home. 
   How do they fix this problem? They fix the problem with what they call a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   There are two rights that they guarantee. 
   No. 1, you can look in the blue pages of the phonebook, and you can call up a Government bureaucrat, and you can complain. You can get an appointment. You can go see them next Tuesday at 8 o'clock. You can get a bureaucrat to join you in the examining room. That, to them, is a health care bill of rights. 
   The second right they guarantee is, you can call up an attorney. You can open up the Yellow Pages. Here is one that says, ``No fees unless we get you money.'' Anyway, whoever you find in here--criminal law, family law, personal injury specialist--you can pick any lawyer you want under their health care bill of rights, and you can call him, and you can sue.  
   But what you cannot do under their so-called bill of rights that you can do under our bill of rights is, under our bill of rights you can fire your HMO. You can set up a medical savings account and then you can look in the Yellow Pages under ``Physician.'' You can call any physician you want to call, and you can say to them, do you take a check? If they do, with the medical savings account that you can have under our bill with your 
   employer, you can say ``no'' to your HMO. You don't call up the Government, because you don't like how they are treating you, or, go hire a lawyer. You fire your HMO and hire your doctor. 
   You can see what real freedom is. You can say to the HMO, you haven't done me right, you haven't treated my children right, and you are fired. 
   Our bill does that. Their bill does not do that. 
   I cannot end the day without pointing out two things. 
   One, all day long you have heard from people who invented HMOs and who love them so much that they wanted to put the whole country under HMOs in a mandated Government-run program. And they still do. 
   Second, their remedy for all of these concerns is, call the Government, or call a lawyer. 
   Our remedy is to first deal with the real concerns in HMOs with a review process that really works. 
   But we have one more freedom they don't have. Under our bill, you can fire your HMO. That is what I call real freedom. That is what we provide. 
   If you have listened all day to these horror stories, please remember, this is a monster that they helped create and that they loved so much, they wanted to mandate that everybody be in it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will take a very short amount of time. 
   If I am so wrong about the Clinton health care bill, I hope tomorrow to offer it as an amendment, and we will give everybody a chance to vote on it. We debated it for 2 years. It was like a great big overinflated balloon. When somebody pricked it with a little pin, all of the air ran out of it. We never got around to voting on it. We have it here. We can send it up tomorrow and give everybody a chance to vote on it. 
   If Senator KENNEDY thinks it is so right--I know he does in his heart because he is a very sincere person--then he can vote for the Clinton health care bill, and fine these people, and put doctors in prison for 15 years for providing ``unauthorized'' care. Then we will know where we all stand on these issues. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes. 
   I have to say we often see people do 180 degree turns around here. It never ceases to amaze me to hear our Democrat colleagues savaging HMOs. Let us remember they are the people who have been in love with HMOs for 25 years. 
   In fact, they loved HMOs so much that in these bills virtually crushing this ancient desk--the 1994 Clinton health care bill and the two Kennedy variations of it--they loved HMOs so much they would have set up health care collectives all over the Nation, run by the Federal Government, and would have fined Americans $5,000 for refusing to join their health care collective. They loved HMOs so much in 1994, they would have imposed a $50,000 fine on a doctor who prescribed medical treatment that was not dictated or allowed by their Government-run HMO health care collective. 
   They loved HMOs so much in 1994, if a doctor provided treatment you needed for your baby that was not provided for in their Government-run health care collective, and you paid him for it, he could go to prison for 15 years. That was their vision of a health care future for America. 
   But having loved HMOs so much that they wanted to mandate that everybody in America be a member of one run by the Government, now all of a sudden they have done a public opinion survey. They have gotten focus groups together, and they have decided Americans are not as much in love with HMOs as they are. 
   And so as a result, now they have a bill that doesn't say, as they said in 1994, HMOs are the answer to everything. They have a bill that now says HMOs are the problem. 
   What we try to do in our bill is fix the problems, but we do something they will not do: We empower Americans to fire their HMO. We allow Americans to buy medical savings accounts, where they have the right to choose for themselves. 
   Our Democrat colleagues are adamantly opposed to that freedom because they want the Government to run the health care system. And you can't get the Government running the health care system if you start giving people the power to fire their HMO. So they want to regulate the HMOs. They want to give you the ability to contact a bureaucrat if you are unhappy. They want to give you total freedom to hire a lawyer. You can hire whatever lawyer you want to hire. 
   But what they will not do is give you the ability to hire your doctor. Why don't they want to do it? Because this is simply one step in the direction of this health care bill that they want and love, and which we killed. But in their heart, they still want Government health care collectives, and they want people fined and imprisoned if they don't provide medicine exactly the way the Democrats want it provided. 
   Now they say, well, something is wrong with the Republican bill because they are not overriding State law. They think that somehow Senator KENNEDY and President Clinton know more about Texas than the people in the Texas Legislature and the Texas Governor. They believe we should trample State law and we ought to make every decision in Washington, DC. We don't agree. They say they want America to know the difference. Please know that this is the difference. 
   If Senator KENNEDY and President Clinton know so much about Texas, when President Clinton finishes in the White House, maybe he ought to move to Texas and run for some public office. It would be an educational experience, I can assure you, both for him and the people of Texas. 
   But the point is, I am not going to let Senator KENNEDY and President Clinton tell the people in Texas how to run  their State. I am not going to do it either. If I wanted to do that, I would run for the state legislature. 
   Let's get to the issue we are talking about here. The problem with the Kennedy bill is it drives up costs. The problem with the Kennedy bill is that the Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the Kennedy bill would drive up health care costs by 6.1 percent. 
   What that means is two things: One, 1.8 million Americans would lose their health insurance. Now, granted, if their bill passed, you would have the ability to pick up the phone book, look in the blue pages and call any government agency you wanted; you could hire any lawyer you wanted. But 1.8 million people would not have health insurance under this bill. Their bill would drive up health costs for those who got to keep their insurance by $72.7 billion over a 5-year period. 
   Let me convert that into something people understand. By 1.8 million people being denied health insurance because of the cost of all these lawyers and Government bureaucrats and therefore losing their insurance under the Kennedy bill, that would mean that in breast exams, 188,595 American women would lose breast exams that they would have under current law because Senator Kennedy's bill would drive up health insurance costs so much. 
   Because 1.8 million people would lose their health insurance under the Kennedy bill, there would be 52,973 fewer mammograms. Why? Is Senator Kennedy against mammograms? Of course he is not. But the point is, his bill, by driving up costs, by hiring all these bureaucrats and all these lawyers, where 60 percent of what comes out of these lawsuits goes to lawyers and not to people who 
   have been damaged, hurt, or are sick--by imposing those new costs, 52,973 women per year would lose mammograms that they are getting, which are funded today under their health insurance policies. 
   Under Senator KENNEDY's bill, 135,122 women that get annual pap tests funded by their insurance policy would not get them because they would lose their insurance. 
   And so that no one thinks I am totally discriminating against men, prostate screenings would decline by 23,135. That's 23,135 men who would not get screened, who might die of prostate cancer because Senator KENNEDY thinks it is more important to be able to hire a lawyer than it is for people to have insurance so that they can get prostate screening. 
   Really, the bill before us is not about doctors. Nothing in Senator KENNEDY's bill lets you choose your doctor or fire your HMO. It lets you choose a lawyer and contact a bureaucrat. In doing so, it drives up costs by 6.1 percent and it denies 1.8 million people their health insurance. As a result, we get less care, not more; we get more expensive care, not cheaper. And anybody that believes that being able to hire a lawyer or contact a bureaucrat heals people clearly does not understand how medicine works. 
   The amendment before us is a very simple amendment. My guess is that after they pray over it a while, everybody will vote for it. It kills the Kennedy bill, no question about that. But I don't think they are going to want to vote against it because what this amendment says very simply is this: It sets up a triggering mechanism. It says that if this bill were to be adopted--which it won't be because we are going to defeat it this week because we have a better bill that works better--if it was found and certified that in any year, when fully implemented, this bill would drive up costs by more than 1 percent, the law would not go into effect. Or if in any year more than 100,000 people lost their health insurance as a result of the cost increase also imposed, then this bill would not be operative. 
   Now we know from CBO estimates that both of these things will occur. We have offered this amendment basically to point out the fact that the problem with the Kennedy bill is that it drives up costs, and it denies people health insurance. 
   Finally, let me say do I believe this is the end game? Suppose for a moment that we could pass their bill, if President Clinton could override every legislature and State, and we could have the Government decide, by law, what is the preferred service, what is the means of treating every disease so we would set by Federal statute all those things. Suppose that we did all those things and drove up health care costs, would the Democrats be happy? No, and neither would the American people. 
   Next year, they would come back with their old faithful, the Clinton health care bill, and they would say: Medical costs have risen by 6.1 percent, 1.8 million people have lost their health insurance, and there is only one solution. We have to have the Government take over the health care system. We will make everybody join an HMO. We will take their freedom completely away, and, in fact, we will fine them $5,000 if they refuse to do it, and we will make doctors practice medicine our way. We will fine them $50,000 if they give a treatment we don't approve, or we will put them in prison if they provide medical care that is not on our approved Federal list. 
   That will be their answer to the problem they create with this bill. That is what this debate is about. 
   I am sure, having looked at their bill, they have done a poll, they have looked at a focus group, and they have determined that somehow they are going to gain some political points by the bill they put forward. 
   We have gone about it a little bit differently. We have spent 2 years with people such as BILL FRIST--who has actually practiced medicine; not only practiced, he is one of the premier doctors in America--putting together a bill that fixes the problems with HMOs, that doesn't write medical practice into law. If we had written medical practice into law 100 years ago, we would still be bleeding people for fevers. 
   We have put together a bill that tries to deal with abuses in HMOs so a final decision is made by an independent doctor as to what ``necessity'' is. We go a step further. We expand freedom so that people get a chance with our reforms, if they are not happy with their HMO, they can say something under our bill to the HMO that they can't say under Senator KENNEDY's bill. Under our bill, if all else fails, they can say to their HMO: You didn't do the job. You didn't take care of me, you didn't take care of my children, and you are fired. I'm going to get a medical savings account. I'm going to make my own decisions. 
   That is the difference between what Democrats call rights and what Republicans call freedom. Their rights are the right to more government, the right to more regulation, the right to look in the blue pages and call up a government bureaucrat, to look in the Yellow Pages under ``Attorney'' and call up a lawyer. 
   But their health care rights do not include the right to hire your own doctor or to fire your HMO. What kind of right is it when you have a right to complain and petition but you don't have a right to act? 
   Our bill is about freedom, the freedom to choose. That is the difference. Our Democrat colleagues don't support that freedom, because they want a government-run system. 
   Senator KENNEDY is not deterred. We may have killed the Clinton-Kennedy bill in 1994 taking over the health care system, but he dreams of bringing it back. If he can win on his bill this week, it is a step in that direction. But he is not going to be successful. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights drives up health care costs by 6.1 percent. It causes 1.8 million Americans to lose their health insurance. It raises the cost of health care for those who don't lose their health insurance by $72.5 billion. By driving up labor costs, it would destroy 194,041 jobs in the American economy by the year 2003. These are not our numbers. These are numbers based on estimates done by the CBO and private research firms that have used those numbers to project the economic impact. 
   Our amendment simply says if the Kennedy bill drives up health care costs by more than 1 percent when it is fully implemented, or if it pushes more than 100,000 Americans off the private insurance rolls by driving up cost, then the law will not go into effect; it will be suspended.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin by explaining how we came to be here. Then I want to take a little walk down memory lane, as Ronald Reagan used to say, and talk about the real Democrat health care bill--the bill offered in 1993. I then want to talk about the difference between the two bills--the Democratic Kennedy bill, and our bill--and why that difference is relevant to every working American family. 
   Then I would like to conclude by explaining why our bill is a good bill and why I am confident that if Senator KENNEDY and I could go into every house in America and sit down with people at their kitchen table, and if he could explain his bill and what he is trying to do, and if I could explain our bill and what we are trying to do, I am confident that 90 percent of the people in America would choose our bill. 
   We are going to have 4 days of debate. But the outcome of the debate, I think, is clear. We are going to win when the votes are cast, and we are going to win this debate because we have a better program. Our program benefits the people who do the work and pay the taxes and pull the wagon in America. 
   I think when the week is over that we will have discredited the approach of this bill as we discredited the bill in 1993. But, of greater importance, we will have passed a real bill that gives Americans real freedoms. 
   Our colleagues have lamented that we have waited this long to deal with this issue. I want to remind everyone that last year throughout the year the majority leader offered to bring this bill up, and he offered to bring it up in two different forms. 
   I thought the most reasonable offer was to let the Democrats write the best bill they could write that does the most that they can provide to help people with health insurance and to impose whatever restrictions they want to write. Then let Republicans put together the best bill they can put together, and bring the two bills to the floor of the Senate and let the Senate choose between one. We could then choose one or the other. That was rejected by the minority. 
   We then offered them the ability to bring the two bills up and each side have five amendments. That was rejected by the minority. 
   Not to waste a lot of time to get into a debate with the minority leader, or with other Democrats, I simply submit that we have been 2 years getting to this point because the Democrats have wanted it to be 2 years getting to this point. We could have brought up bills and voted under an orderly process 2 years ago. But, in reality, the Democrats thought they had a political issue. That is why we are only getting to this bill now. I think we are going to prove this week they don't have much of a political issue, and I think when the debate is over they are going to be glad it is over. And I think the American people are going to be glad it is over. 
   Let me remind my colleagues, and anybody who is watching this debate in America, that this is not the first time Bill Clinton and TED KENNEDY have wanted to rewrite the health care system of this country. I have here on this desk the Clinton health care bills, and the version of it that was sponsored by Senator KENNEDY. 
   Let me remind those who followed that debate in 1993--their memories might have gotten a little clouded--what this bill did. This bill said that the problem in America was that we had 43 million Americans who didn't have health insurance, and that in trying to deal with health insurance and make it available, we needed to get rid of the current health care system, and we needed to set up on a regional basis in America health care collectives that people would be forced to join. And these collectives would be run by the Government. The whole idea behind the Kennedy bill in 1993 was give up freedom to control cost. 
   Obviously, I wouldn't have enough time in the day or the week to go through all of these provisions. But let me just remind you of a couple of them. 
   In 1993, Senator KENNEDY, Senator DASCHLE, and President Clinton said: We are going to have the Government take over the health care system in your hometown--in Phoenix, AZ. There would be one health care collective run by the Government, and if you refused to join that collective, you would be fined $5,000. 
   That is what they wanted in 1993. That was their concept of freedom when they last asked us to let them run the health care system in America. 
   Then they said, if this plan did not provide the kind of health care you needed and you sought to get that health care through your physician and the health care was not allowed under this plan, the physician could be fined $50,000. 
   If you needed health care for your child, their concept of freedom, in 1993, in the Clinton-Kennedy health care bill, was: We know what kind of health care you need. They said: We are going to provide it in this bill, and, if you want health care outside this bill and a physician provides it for you, we are going to fine them $50,000. 
   That was their concept of freedom in 1993. 
   In 1993 they said, What about the circumstance where your baby is really sick? So you go to a doctor and say, I need health care, and they, under the Clinton-Kennedy plan, say, We are not allowed to provide this kind of treatment. You say, forget about the plan, I'll pay for it out of my own pocket. In 1993, Senator KENNEDY and Senator DASCHLE and President Clinton thought so much of freedom that they said, If you pay the doctor out of your pocket for a treatment that we do not provide for, and the doctor takes the money, he can be sent to prison for 15 years. That was their concept of patients' rights in 1993. That is what they thought freedom consisted of in 1993. 
   I submit, this is what they still want. The bill that is before us, their bill, is step 1 toward government running the health care system, so when my mama needs to go see a doctor, she first has to talk to a government bureaucrat. We defeated that in 1993, and we are going to defeat it this week in the Senate. 
   What is the plan today? Unlike 1993, when our colleagues were very concerned about the cost of health care, now they are not concerned about health care cost, they are concerned about rights. So all of a sudden they have put together a bill that imposes a whole lot of government restrictions, that expands liability, so 60 percent of the premiums that go to provide insurance against medical liability will end up going to lawyers instead of to doctors and hospitals and clinics. 
   They have put together a bill that the Congressional Budget Office has said, when you take into account all the bureaucracy and all the legal liability, will drive up the cost of health care by 6.1 percent. That is equivalent to taking 6.1 percent right out of the paycheck of working Americans in order for them to be able to keep their insurance. Only a lot of Americans will not be able to keep their insurance. In fact, a study funded by the AFL-CIO has concluded, if you take the increase in health care costs under the Kennedy plan, 1.8 million Americans will lose their health insurance. 
   Mr. President, 1.8 million Americans will lose their health insurance if we should adopt the bill that the Democrats have proposed. For those who are lucky enough not to be one of the 1.8 million people who would lose their health insurance, they would pay $72.7 billion over a 5-year period more for health insurance and health costs than they are paying now. 
   This is not just about dollars, this is about real people and real health care. By 1.8 million people losing their health insurance, that means you would have 188,595 fewer breast examinations every year for Americans, because the Kennedy bill would take away their health insurance. It means 52,973 American women would not have mammograms who would have them under current law, because the increase in cost under this bill would take away their health insurance. It means that 135,122 Pap tests would not be undertaken, because people would have lost their health insurance and therefore lost access to that coverage. Mr. President, 23,135 American men, mostly elderly men, would lose their prostate  screening exam as a result of the health care cost increase that would be dictated by the Kennedy plan. 
   So what do they offer us in the name of health care rights? They offer us a bill that would drive up health insurance costs by 6.1 percent, costing 1.8 million Americans their health insurance, and for those who are lucky enough to be able to afford to keep their health insurance, they would pay $72.7 billion more for their health insurance over a 5-year period. 
   In return for all of these costs, what do people get? Rather than going into the details, I am going to reduce it down to a very simple example. I want to define the problem Senator KENNEDY sees--and we agree on the problem. Then I am going to explain what he provides in the name of rights that drives up costs by 6.1 percent, costs 1.8 million people their health insurance, and those who keep their health insurance pay $72.7 billion more for it. 
   Here is the problem. The innovation--which, by the way, has been championed by the people who are offering this amendment--is HMOs. They thought so much of them they wanted to force everybody in America into a government-run HMO. But, under HMO, there is a problem. The problem is that people lose the control they want and need over their health care. Let me reduce it down to a simple example. 
   When people with an HMO go into the examining room, too often, in addition to their doctor in the examining room, they have, either literally or figuratively, the HMO gatekeeper in the examining room. So they are going into the examining room--obviously, that often entails taking your clothes off. People are often a little nervous about that. They want privacy. They like to be in the examining room with their doctor, but with an HMO they find themselves with this gatekeeper virtually looking over the doctor's shoulder. They would like to be in the examining room alone with the doctor. We agree. We think they should have the right to make that choice. 
   But how does Senator KENNEDY fix the problem? How Senator KENNEDY fixes the problem--and you will be able to tell why it is so expensive when you look at it--the way Senator KENNEDY fixes the problem is demonstrated by this stethoscope. What people want is the doctor in the examining room with the stethoscope up against their heart, but right now they have an HMO listening in, double-checking their doctor. They would like to get this HMO gatekeeper out of the examining room. So what does Senator KENNEDY do? He says: We can fix your problem. It will cost 1.8 million of you your health insurance; those who keep the health insurance, it will cost $72.7 billion more. But look at what you get. 
   What you get under Senator KENNEDY's plan is this. He doesn't get rid of the HMO, that guy is still there listening in, but he brings a government bureaucrat into the examining room who will be there to keep an eye on the HMO, and to keep an eye on the doctor, and to regulate. Then, in addition to the bureaucrat, he brings the lawyer into the examining room who will be there keeping an eye on the bureaucrat and HMO and the doctor, so that he can be there to sue the doctor or the HMO. 
   The reason Senator KENNEDY's plan drives up health care costs by 6.1 percent and costs 1.8 million Americans their health insurance and drives up the cost for those who can afford to keep it by $72.7 billion is it costs a lot of money to bring all these bureaucrats and all these lawyers into the process. 
   But the point is, what people are unhappy about is the HMO gatekeepers being in the examining room. They wanted to get them out of the examining room. They do not want to bring the bureaucrats in and bring lawyers in. What they want is a health care system that looks like this: They want a health care system where you have two people in the examining room and one of them is you. You are on this end of the stethoscope, and your doctor is on the other end of the stethoscope, and there is nobody else in the room. That is what they want. 
   The difference between the Kennedy bill and our bill is, under his bill, he brings in the bureaucrat and the lawyer. So now you have four people in the examining room. What we do is we get rid of the HMO gatekeeper and give people real freedom. 
   This is such a critically important point. Our Democrat colleagues have gotten caught up in this deal about how they are going to give people rights. I think it is wonderful that it is so easy for somebody to see what they mean by ``rights'' and what we mean by ``freedom'' are two totally different things. 
   Under the Democrat bill, you are not free to fire the HMO your boss picks for you, but you are free to have the Government regulate it. 
   Under the Kennedy plan, you are not free to fire your doctor, but you can sue him. 
   Under the Kennedy plan, you are not free to control your health care cost, but you can share that control with a lawyer and with the Government. 
   What we do is give people freedom. It is an interesting paradox that the Kennedy bill debases the very term ``choice.'' It debases the very term of ``rights'' because it contains no rights; that is, no rights that are really meaningful to somebody who has a child who is sick or whose mama is ill. 
   We give people real rights. We give people the right to fire their HMO by guaranteeing them an alternative, which I will talk about in a minute. 
   We give people the right to fire their doctor. 
   We give people the right to take their health care money and spend it as they choose on their own family. 
   We give people the right to pick the protections they believe are important to their family, not those basic benefits the Government might decide in Washington would be useful. 
   And finally, we give people the right to control their own health care, something the Democrats do not do. 
   The Democrat plan means more Government, more lawyers, more rules, more uninsured and more Government control, but the one thing it does not mean, the one thing it does not provide is more freedom. Our bill provides more freedom. Let me explain two ways it does. 
   First of all, under the current tax system, we have a terrible inequity. If General Motors buys your health insurance for you as their employee, it is tax deductible. But if you buy it for yourself as either a small businessperson who does not have health insurance or a self-employed who does not have health insurance or somebody who works for a company that does not provide health insurance, or if you would rather buy your own health insurance rather than General Motors choosing for you, it is not fully tax deductible. The first thing our bill does is it treats you as well as current tax law treats General Motors. Under our bill, if you buy your own health insurance--let's say you are self-employed. You will get the right to the same tax treatment that General Motors does, so your health insurance is tax free. 
   The second and most important choice we give to people is a totally new program, a new choice. We do not force anybody to take it, but we give people the ability to buy, in addition to all the choices we provide with everything from an HMO to private practice of medicine through a medical savings account, we expand people's freedom. One of the choices we provide, which I am very excited about, is the right to buy a medical savings account. Here is how it would work. 
   A medical savings account is a device that really is aimed at helping people who want health care coverage but who often do not have a lot of money. The way it would work is, in addition to joining the health plan your company might try to impose on you, you have the right to take your money and buy a high-deductible insurance policy and then join with your company in setting aside money to pay the deductibles in what we call the medical savings 
   account. Those medical savings accounts are fully tax free, just like conventional health insurance. Here is basically how it would work. 
   You might buy a health insurance policy with a $3,000 deductible. Normally, that policy would cost less than half as much as a first-dollar-coverage policy. Then you and your employer would begin to build up a savings account up to $3,000, which would belong to you, to cover the deductible. 
   Then how it works is you make the decision, when your child needs to see a doctor, which doctor your child needs to see. You are empowered to make the decision.  
   It is true that under the Kennedy plan, if your baby has a 104-degree fever, you could get out the phonebook and you could look under the blue pages for the U.S. Government and you could find the Health Care Financing Administration, or HCFA as they are called, and at 2 o'clock in the morning you could call up HCFA. You would, in all probability, get an answering machine if you were lucky. Maybe you would not. I do not think you are going to find the Director of HCFA at work at 2 o'clock in the morning. You can call up and leave a message, and then they, under the Kennedy plan, will set up a meeting. Maybe next Tuesday at 4:52 in the afternoon they might meet with you or talk to you on the phone. 
   You also could call up a lawyer. You could look under ``attorney'' in the phone page and you can pick--one thing about Senator KENNEDY's health care rights bill is it gives you no freedom with regard to doctors, but it gives you complete freedom with regard to attorneys. 
   Senator KENNEDY's bill is unlike the bill he put together in 1993 with President Clinton. Remember, their health care bill in 1993 did not let you sue. They have had a change in heart, it seems, so now he says you can pick up the Yellow Pages and you can look under ``attorney'' and you can pick any attorney. You have your car wrecks. Maybe you want another attorney. This one deals with car wrecks. You have injury. You have family law, criminal law, jail release, traffic tickets, bankruptcy, will and trust, personal injury, board-certified personal attorney. Anyway, you find the one who suits you. You hire that attorney, and you go to court. Eighteen months from now, you might be able to collect some money from some doctor or from some HMO. 
   Our bill does not work that way. Under our bill, if your baby has a temperature, you pick up the Yellow Pages. I have the Yellow Pages from Arlington and Mansfield, TX. This Yellow Pages lists all the physicians who practice medicine in that area. 
   Under our plan, you pick up the phone and you call up the physician you might pick. Let's say I pick Louis W. Adams, pediatric ophthalmologist, and I call him up. Under the Kennedy bill, I would have to ask him some questions. I would have to say: Are you a preferred provider? In fact, we did an experiment on that in Washington, DC. Let me show it to you. 
   In Washington, DC, we took a page out of the phonebook. It was page 1017. These are the physicians who were listed. The first one is Ginsberg, Susan M., M.D., and the last one is Robert O. Gordon. 
   Let's say you are in an HMO or you are in a PPO, and you call up--let's say you pick Philip W. Gold. You call him up and say: Dr. Gold, I need health care. I have a child who has a 103-degree temperature. Are you in the Kaiser HMO, 
   or are you part of the Blue Cross PPO? 
   We found that out of the 28 doctors, 10 accepted the Kaiser HMO, 17 accepted the Blue Cross PPO. But let me tell you the amazing revelation we made. With a medical savings account, which any American could set up, under the Republican plan, you would get a checking account. This is from Golden Rule Insurance Company in Indiana. This is a medical savings account checking account. Then this is for a medical savings account that is operated by Mellon Bank, and this is a MasterCard. Then this is an American Health Value medical savings account, and this is operated through Visa. 
   Under the Republican plan, you would have the right to opt for a medical savings account where you would make the decision about health care for your family. We empower you--not some lawyer, not some bureaucrat--but we empower you as a parent. 
   So then we called up everybody on page 1017 of the Yellow Pages and we asked them three questions: 
   Do you take a check? 
   Yes. Every one of them took a check. 
   Do you take Visa? 
   Every one of them took Visa. 
   Do you take MasterCard? 
   Every one of them, all 28 of them, took MasterCard. 
   So the real freedom in the Republican bill is the right for you to choose--not to choose a lawyer to sue somebody 18 months from now, not to call up a government bureaucrat and fill out a form and register a protest. What kind of freedom is that? The freedom we give is the freedom to act, the freedom to hire, the freedom to fire, the freedom to say yes, the freedom to say no. That is what freedom is about. 
   Our Democrat colleagues believe freedom is about being able to talk to a bureaucrat. They think freedom is about the right to sue. 
   Under the Republican plan, freedom is the right to say to your HMO: You're fired. I don't like the way I'm being treated here. I'm leaving your HMO. I'm opting for another option. The example I gave is a medical savings account. 
   Freedom, under the Republican plan, is the freedom to pick up the phonebook and let your fingers do the walking. You pick the doctor: I want John V. Golding, Jr. I don't want anybody else. He is the doctor I want. I got his telephone number. I called him up and said: My mama is sick, Dr. Golding, and I would like her to come see you. Do you take a check or MasterCard or Visa? He says: Yes. I am in. 
   As this debate goes on, you are going to hear Senator KENNEDY, and others, say: The world will come to an end if you have medical savings accounts. They are going to use the interesting charge they use any time they are against something, and that is it is for rich people. If Democrats are not for something, they claim it is for rich people. Tax cuts are for rich people. Choice, freedom, is for rich people. They are going to say: Oh, the medical savings accounts, rich people will get medical savings accounts and poor people will not have them; it will just be terrible. 
   The facts are that even though we have a limited number of medical savings accounts that can be sold, even though in the year 2000 they lose this option and have to go back into the old system unless we change the law, the people who are buying medical savings accounts are primarily modest-income people. But we are going to repeal those limitations and we are going to do it this week. Uninsured people are buying medical savings accounts because it allows them to buy an affordable high-deductible policy that covers them against terrible things happening and then lets them build up savings accounts with their employer to pay the deductible. 
   So those who are going to criticize medical savings accounts are going to say it is for rich people, but they really do not like it because it is freedom. What they want is this. They want the old Clinton health care bill. They know that if we ever give 
   people the right to choose, they will never nationalize health care. So medical savings accounts are, to our dear colleague from Massachusetts, like a crucifix is to a vampire. They cower, they are struck with fear at the idea that some parent would actually have the ability to fire an HMO and do it without having to call a bureaucrat or without having to hire a lawyer. 
   Why do they fear freedom? Because they are not for it. They want the Government to take over and run the health care system--always have, always will. 
   The basic question is, Who should manage care? Should it be an insurance company? Should it be the Government? Or should it be you? We believe it ought to be you. We believe that parents ought to be empowered to control health care. We believe that parents can make better decisions. 
   That is what this debate is about. This debate is about whether freedom means getting access to a bureaucrat or firing your HMO, whether freedom in health care means hiring a lawyer or being able to hire your own doctor. That is what the debate is about. 
   A final point I would like to make--and I think it is a significant point; some people would say it is a reach, but I do not think so--why, all of a sudden, are our same colleagues who in 1993 wanted the Government to take over and run the health care system and make everybody be in one big Government-run HMO--why, all of a sudden, do they want to drive up costs in the name of expanding bureaucracy and lawsuits? 
   Part of it is, they like bureaucracy and they like lawsuits. But that is not, in my opinion, the real story. The real story is, if, God forbid--and He is going to forbid, because we clearly have the votes to stop him but if, God forbid,  the Kennedy plan should be adopted, and health insurance went up by 6.1 percent and 1.8 million people lost their health insurance, does anybody doubt that next year Senator KENNEDY would be back with the Clinton health care bill saying: Now 1.8 million people have lost their health insurance, and we have no choice except to let the Government take over the health care system? I think that is what he would say. In fact, I think that is basically what we are debating here: Destroy the private health care system so the only alternative would be Government. 
   Our answer is: Let's make the current health care system better; let's have a meaningful, timely internal and external appeal if you want to stay in an HMO; let's empower people to fire HMOs and go to the private practice of medicine again if they choose; let's expand freedom as a solution to making our current system work better to make it more efficient and to empower families to make more choices. 
   The alternative the Democrats have is: Destroy the current system and then let's let Government take over and run the health care system. 
   Our answer is: Expand freedom and choice within the current system, empower families to decide, and let's forever and ever keep Government out of health care. 
   That is really the choice. Our Democrat colleagues believe that somehow they are going to benefit by Americans knowing they are unhappy about HMOs and they want to expand your access to bureaucrats and lawyers. We do not think that solves the problem. We think what solves the problem is to make HMOs give you an effective internal and external appeal; but we go one step further, and that is, we empower people to fire the HMO and to hire their own doctor. 
   We believe in freedom. We believe freedom works. It built America in every other era. Can you imagine if we had a Clinton-Kennedy car insurance bill or car repair bill so that if you are unhappy with your assigned repairman to fix your car, and if you are unhappy with what he does, you contact a bureaucrat and then, if you are unhappy with what he does, you contact a lawyer? I submit that the cost of repairing our cars would be astronomical. 
   We have a different system. It is one we would like in health care. That is, you pick where you go to get your car repaired, and if you do not like the work they are doing, you say to them, in a traditional American fashion: You are not doing a good job. You have not lived up to our trust. You have not done what you said you would do. And you're fired. 
   That is freedom. That is freedom. That is what we want. We want the right of people to choose. 
   We don't want this substitute for the right to choose, the right to pile up costs in lawsuits or the right to deal with bureaucrats. What kind of right is that? How many wrongs do bureaucrats right? About one-tenth as many as they create. 
   We give you freedom. The Democrats give you bureaucracy. We help lower the cost of health care by expanding choices and expanding tax deductibility. They drive up the cost of health care by 6.1 percent. Their bill would deny health insurance to 1.8 million Americans. Their bill would drive up health care costs by $72.7 billion. Senator KENNEDY likes to claim, well, it is just a hamburger a day for however long. Well, with $72.7 billion, you could buy every McDonald's franchise in America for the 5-year cost that this will drive up health insurance. 
   Senator KENNEDY doesn't understand that if the company you are working for is paying your health insurance and the cost is driven up, you are still paying it. It is part of your wages. What is going to happen, according to estimates that were undertaken by the AFL-CIO--in support of this bill, by the way--is that 1.8 million people will lose their health insurance. We don't want that to happen, and we are going to stop it from happening. 
   This is going to be a very meaningful debate. I look forward to it. I think people will learn from it. I think in the end they are going to have two different choices about what freedom is. 
   If freedom to you is access to a bureaucrat and a lawyer, then you are with Senator KENNEDY. If freedom to you is the right to choose your own health care, your own doctor, the right to hire and the right to fire, the right to say what you want and people either do it or you get somebody else, if that is what freedom means in your hometown, if you would rather be able to pick up the Arlington-Mansfield phonebook when your baby is sick and look up ``physician'' rather than look up ``attorney'' or, rather than look in the Blue Pages for HCFA, if that is what you would like to have, you are with us. On the other hand, if you think your answer is at HCFA in the Blue Pages or with an attorney, then you want to be with Senator KENNEDY. It is about as clear a choice as you could possibly have. 
   When the debate is over this week, not only will we have won the vote, but I think, more importantly, we will have won the debate. We will have ended, hopefully forever, any dream of ever getting back to the Clinton health care bill, where every American is forced into a health care collective and, when your momma gets sick, she talks to a bureaucrat instead of a doctor. They tried that in 1993. Eighty-two percent of the American people thought this might be a good idea. Finally, when a few of us stood up and fought it, it was like sticking a great big inflated balloon with a pin. Suddenly, once people understood it, they were against it. They understood that what was at stake wasn't just health care, but what was at stake was freedom. 
   That is what this is about--the right to choose. Don't get confused about it, as we go through the debate. 
   I thank the Chair for its indulgence. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time. 
   Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GRAMM. This is very important. 
   Senator KENNEDY keeps standing up and really setting up the straw man and knocking him down, it seems to me. 
   I want to pose this as a question. 
   He is saying this bill covers 160 million people, whereas our bill covers only 48 million people. 
   But isn't it true that under our bill we cover those that are in self-funded plans where the Federal Government has jurisdiction and where the States don't have the freedom to legislate patients' rights? So we deal with the Federal jurisdiction and allow the individual States to set up their own program. But Senator KENNEDY wants to do the same thing that he did in the Clinton-Kennedy health bill of 1993, and that is to have the Federal Government set mandates even though 43 States have passed their own laws. 
   Is that not the distinction we are talking about? Senator KENNEDY believes that only he knows anything about this and that the State legislature in Texas does not know anything about health care and doesn't care anything about Texas. But Senator KENNEDY knows about it. In fact, he helped President Clinton do the 1993 bill, which would have put everybody into a health care collective run by the Federal Government--one big HMO very much similar to and with all the compassion of the IRS. But now he says that States aren't competent, even though 43 of them have passed patients' bills of rights. He is trying to preempt those States, whereas I understand our bill simply goes to the people who can't, because of Federal law, be covered by State patients' rights. 
   Is that correct?

   Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will yield further, does the Senator believe that HCFA cares more about the people of Oklahoma than the State representatives--the State senator and the Governor--who may not know the Oklahoma needs the way Senator KENNEDY and HCFA know them?

   Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, we have had a health care debate for the last couple of weeks. The problem is that we are on appropriations bills. We are trying to pass a bill that will help stabilize the condition of farms and ranches all over America. 
   However, our colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle have seemed determined to talk about health care. I will talk about health care today. 
   I begin by saying, first of all, this is not the beginning of the health care debate. Here are some bills we have debated on health care since President Clinton has been in office. This is the Clinton health care bill. We were told in 1993 there was a crisis in America and we needed to deal with it. The way to deal with it was setting up health care collectives where every American would be forced to buy their health care from one in their geographic region that would be set up with a local collective leader, appointed by the Government. Then all the doctors would work for this health care collective and the Government from Washington would issue mandates. 
   Then people such as myself said that this is a terrible loss of freedom. When you adopt the Clinton health care bill that I have on the desk, when my mama is sick, she will end up talking to a bureaucrat instead of a doctor. We were told by Senator KENNEDY and by President Clinton we have to give up this freedom because we have 30 million American families who have no health insurance. 
   So in 1993, we were told if we would pass these bills and let Government run the health care system, if we would force every American into a health care collective where Government could run it efficiently and where Government could guarantee our health care, that we would lose some freedom, but we would deal with the problem of lack of coverage. We were told that the problem in 1993 was access. 
   We had a big debate. At one point 82 percent of the American people thought these health care collectives were a great idea. Finally, a few Members of Congress stood up and said, ``Over my cold, dead political body.'' It was like somebody had taken a pin and stuck it in a big, fat inflated balloon. It just went whoosh, and suddenly everybody decided this was not a debate about health care; this was a debate about freedom. 
   The reason I go back to this history is two things. First of all, please remember when we are debating the so-called Health Care Bill of Rights, it has the same authors who wrote the Clinton health care bill setting up health care collectives. They have not changed their minds about what kind of American health care they want. They really believe the Government knows best. They really believe if the Government ran the health care system that everybody could have access and everything would be better because the Government, through these health care collectives, could make decisions for us and we are basically ignorant people and we do not know how to make decisions for ourselves. This was and is still their goal. 
   We defeated the Clinton health care bill because the American people decided it may have been Senator KENNEDY's goal, it may have been Bill Clinton's goal, but it was not their goal. In fact, I would have to say that during the months I debated this bill by talking about cost and about efficiency, it was similar to throwing rocks at a tank. But suddenly when the issue changed to freedom and the right to chose, we blew the tank up. 
   The same people who several years ago said give up your freedom because the problem is access changed their minds once we defeated them. Now they have a new health care bill they call the Patients' Bill of Rights. Oh, it does have something I guess you could call rights. Let me explain the basic problem and then I want to explain what they call rights and then I want to explain what I call rights and what I think Main Street America would call rights. 
   Here is the problem in a nutshell. First of all, having spent 2 years trying to sell us on the idea we should give up our freedom to get access, they now say: Access is not a problem. Forget the 30 million people who do not have health insurance. In fact, Senator KENNEDY's bill would take health insurance away from another 1.4 million Americans by driving up costs. These are estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. For the people who did not lose  their health insurance, they would pay $57.2 billion more in costs. And by losing their health insurance--by the way, that would mean next year, if we pass the Kennedy health care bill this year, there would be 150,220 fewer breast examinations given to people who might have breast cancer; it would mean there would be 42,194 fewer mammograms; it would mean there would be 107,628 fewer Pap tests; it means there would be 18,458 fewer screenings for prostate cancer. 
   When I am saying Senator KENNEDY's bill, by the CBO estimates, would take insurance away from 1.4 million people, and for the people who got to keep their insurance because they had enough income, it would cost them $57.2 million, don't think I am just talking about money. Don't think I am just talking about a piece of paper that says ``Insurance Policy.'' I am talking about breast examinations, mammograms, Pap tests, and prostate screenings. I am talking about lives. I am talking about families. I am talking about your mama. I am talking about people you care about. This is a big issue. It is an important issue. 
   What is the problem that Senator KENNEDY wants, or tells us he wants, to deal with this year. The problem several years ago was too much freedom, and we had to get people in these health care collectives where Government could provide health care. Now the problem is the private HMOs, after which these Government collectives were modeled, are not giving people enough choices. The same things the Kennedy bill denied when it was the Clinton health care bill, such as the right to sue the Government when it was providing health care, now, all of a sudden, Senator KENNEDY wants to give you the right to sue your doctor. So under the Kennedy plan, if your baby is sick and running a 104 fever, you may not be able to get a doctor, but you can sue. For most people, that is not what they want. But it is interesting that Senator KENNEDY, who denied you the right to sue when he was going to let Government run the health care system, now is willing to attack the private sector and to expand lawsuits. 
   What does he claim he wants to deal with? What he claims he wants to deal with is the following problem. People join HMOs to try to hold down medical costs. You have two people who are working, they have three children, they are trying to make ends meet in their family, they are sitting down the first day of the month at the kitchen table writing those checks, trying to figure out how they are going to pay the bills. So they join an HMO because it is cheaper. The one thing they are very much unhappy about is that the HMO too often gets in between them and their doctor. 
   Let me just do a little analogy, if I may. It is similar to going into the examination room with your doctor--even with your doctor you feel a little bit uncomfortable taking off your clothes; everybody has had that experience. But with an HMO it is almost like the HMO gatekeeper is in the examination room with you. What you really want is to get him out of the room and leave you just with your doctor. What you want is what we show here--if you will just forget the symbols for a minute and just look at this stethoscope--what you want is you at one end of the stethoscope and your doctor's ears at the other end and you want to get any HMO gatekeeper out of the examining room. 
   Senator KENNEDY looks at this problem and here is his solution. His solution to the problem is: OK, you are unhappy because you are in the examining room and you have this gatekeeper in there with you and your doctor. Here is how he solves the problem: He solves the problem by saying, OK, you have your doctor in there, you have your HMO in there, and then what he calls your rights--his Patients' Bill of Rights--your right is not to get the gatekeeper from the HMO out of the examining room. That is not your right. Your right is to have a Government bureaucrat join the HMO gatekeeper and your doctor in the examining room with you, and then to have a lawyer join the Government bureaucrat who joins the HMO gatekeeper in getting between you and your doctor. 
   So Senator KENNEDY's solution to your problem is he puts two more people in the examining room with you. What kind of freedom does he give you? It is an interesting concept of freedom. I do not want to sound too partisan, but it sure defines the difference between the two parties. Freedom to Senator KENNEDY is having a Government bureaucrat who is there who might take your side. Freedom to Senator KENNEDY is freedom to hire a lawyer and sue somebody. 
   That is not the freedom most Americans are talking about when they talk about freedom. Freedom is the right to choose. Freedom is the right to fire your HMO. Freedom is the right to make your own decisions. That is what freedom is about. This so-called Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights may be about rights, but it is not about freedom. 
   The Republican alternative, which we would like to debate and hope to adopt--in fact, to facilitate the debate, our leader has suggested over and over the most eminently reasonable proposal I can imagine. The eminently reasonable proposal is, let the Democrats write the best bill they can write, where they pick exactly the bureaucrat they want who will be there with the gatekeeper in the examining room with you, and then set up the system where you can hire the best lawyer you want to be there, all of them listening to your heartbeat with your doctor--the bureaucrat ready to regulate and the lawyer ready to sue. Let them write the best program they can write, and let us write our best program, and then let's put them before the Senate and let Members choose. 
   Our Democrat colleagues do not want to do that because they know what will happen. They know that ours will be chosen. Now we have spent weeks and weeks fooling around with this thing. 
   To get to the point I want to make, because I know our leader is coming over in a minute to start the debate, the Democrat bill is not what people want. This is not freedom. What people want is the right to fire their doctor, if they want to fire their doctor, to fire their HMO, if they want to fire their HMO, and choose for themselves. On a dark night when their baby has a 104-degree fever, they do not want to be given the freedom to call a lawyer, they want to be given the freedom to call a doctor. What good does calling a lawyer do after the fact? They want the ability to call a doctor to get the best medical care they can for their child. 
   Our bill goes back to this chart. That is, there are two people in the examining room, and you choose to put both of them there under our bill. No. 1, you choose to put yourself there; and, No. 2, you choose the doctor who is in the examining room with you. 
   How does it work? Under our bill, we give people freedom. We give people the right to choose. One of the choices--and I can go through many provisions of our bill. I am just going through one today, and it has to do with medical savings accounts. 
   When we first started debating medical savings accounts, a lot of our Democrat colleagues were for them, but now that they understand them, they hate them, and they hate them because they empower people. They empower mothers and they empower fathers to make decisions rather than governments or HMO's. 
   This is how it works. You have a choice, and one of the choices you can exercise is to set up a medical savings account. You would buy an insurance policy, and you would choose that insurance policy from the company you want to provide the services. It would guarantee your medical expenses beyond, say, $3,000 of expenditures, so that if somebody gets really sick, you have an insurance policy. But then you and your employee would together over time put $3,000 into a medical savings account, and that money would belong to you. 
   Each year, if you had medical expenses, you could spend it out of the medical savings account, where you choose how to spend it on health care and who provides the service, and if at the end of the year you have not spent the money, it belongs to you. So you have an incentive to be cost conscious and efficient and to have a stake in your health care system. But also, you have the right to choose. 
   Here is how Senator KENNEDY's plan works. Under his plan--and let me take the Washington phone book because it is on top--under his plan, you have total freedom to look under ``lawyer'' and hire any lawyer you want to sue,  but you do not have the total 
   freedom to look under ``physician'' and hire any physician. 
   Under Senator KENNEDY's plan, assume, to make a long story short, it is 2 o'clock in the morning. My youngest son Jeff, let's say he is 3 years old--actually he is 22 now, but he was 3--and let's say he has a 103-degree fever. I am never spooked fever until when I see it in my own children. When my children are sick, like any father, I begin to get nervous. 
   Under Senator KENNEDY's plan, I get out the telephone book and I look under ``physician.'' I am not interested in a lawyer. A lawyer cannot do me any good. If I do not get help quickly, I may want to look up and call a preacher. I figure he might do me good, but a lawyer is not going to do me any good. 
   Under Senator KENNEDY's plan, I get out the phone book and look up ``physician'' and ``services.'' Under his plan, I have to call people up and say: I know it is 2 o'clock in the morning, but I am in such and such HMO. Are you a member of my network? Do you participate in the program I participate in? They may or they may not. Most of them do not. In fact, if one goes down the list and picks the biggest network available in Washington, DC, only a very small fraction of the doctors listed in the phone book are members of that network. 
   How does our plan work? My wife and I have put money into our medical savings account. We can have it in one of three forms. We can do it with a checking account. This is an actual medical savings account program by Golden Rule Insurance. They give you a checking account, out of which you pay medical bills. 
   This card is through Mellon Bank, and this is a medical savings account. It is a MasterCard. 
   This is through Visa, and it is a medical savings account from American Health Value. 
   It is 2 o'clock in the morning, and I have a sick child. Under our plan, I call up and I have to ask only one question: Do you take a check? Do you take MasterCard? Do you take Visa? If he does, that doctor is my doctor. 
   I picked a page of the phone book and had my trusty aides call. This is on page 1017 of the DC phone book. On page 1017 of the DC phone book, there is not one doctor on that page who will not take a check. There is not one doctor on that page who will not take a MasterCard. There is not one doctor on that page who will not take Visa. In other words, under the Republican plan, if your baby is sick, you can go to any doctor. If your baby is sick, you choose. 
   What is freedom? Freedom in health care is not the ability to have a Government bureaucrat second-guess the HMO which is second-guessing your doctor. That is not what freedom is about. Freedom is not being able to have a lawyer who can sue the HMO which is second-guessing the doctor and sue your doctor. That is not what freedom is about. 
   Freedom is about the ability to fire your HMO. Freedom is about the ability to choose. Why don't we have a situation where we make everybody go to one kind of grocery store and we have the Government regulate it? We can set up the ability to sue them. We do not do that because, basically, it does not work. That is how we run Government, and that is why it works so poorly. 
   If a grocery store does not sell what I like, I do not go there. If people do not clean my shirts or if the gas I put in the car makes it run poorly, I go to another station and buy another kind of gasoline. 
   All through my life I exercise my freedom to choose. What the Republican plan brings to health care is the freedom to choose. 
   We have gone so far down this road, where we are making American health care look like this, that even our hometown doctors are talking about joining labor unions because they want somebody to help them negotiate with the bureaucrat, they want somebody to help them negotiate with the HMO, and they want some ability to protect themselves from lawsuits. 
   Is that what we want in American health care? I don't think so. I think we want freedom. We want people to have the right to choose. What our bill does is do that. It gives you an opportunity to hire anybody you want to hire, to pick up any phone book in any city--I have here a phone book from Atlanta, GA. Again, you open up the part of the phone book that has to do with the listing of physicians, and any time you pick up the phone, when you have a medical savings account, you can say: Do you take a check? Do you take MasterCard? Do you take Visa? If they do, you are in. 
   Under our bill, you do not find yourself without health care because you are a member of some medical group in Washington but you happen to be in Atlanta when you get sick. Under our plan, the basic currency we use, which is U.S. currency, is taken everywhere. 
   So that is the choice I think people want. This Democrat bill is not freedom. It almost abuses the English language to call this a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   What kind of right do you have in health care when you are guaranteed the right to pick your own lawyer? The right you want in health care is the right to pick your own doctor. The right you want in health care is the right to pick your hospital. The right to choose in health care is the right to say: I don't like how I am being treated. I don't like the kind of service being provided. I think your cost is too high, I think your quality is too low, and I am going to leave. 
   Those are not freedoms guaranteed in Senator KENNEDY's Patients' Bill of Rights. His freedoms are: Look, if you are not happy with the quality of service, then you wait right here--it may take several hours or you may have to come back on Tuesday at 4 o'clock--but we will have a person from Health and Human Services, and they will listen to you and they will talk to you. If you are not happy, you can meet with them. You will have to sign some forms. They will want to look at your medical records; they will go through them. 
   It may take weeks and weeks and months and months and years and years, but under Senator KENNEDY's bill you will have these bureaucrats who will be protecting you. That is freedom to Senator KENNEDY. 
   Then if that fails, Senator KENNEDY said: Well, another freedom you have, you have the freedom to sue. 
   So let's say you have this terrible health care problem, and you or someone you love may be on the verge of death. What Senator KENNEDY's freedom is that first of all, you can talk to this bureaucrat. You may have to come back next Wednesday. You may have to wait in line. You will have to fill out a lot of forms, but he will be there for you at some point. But if that doesn't work, then you can hire a lawyer, and you can sue. You may die, your loved one may die, but you will have a bureaucrat who will have been there. Maybe they did not make it in time--they meant to be there--but they were there for you. And then you can sue somebody if all that happens. That is what their ``freedom'' is about. 
   Our freedom is the right to choose, not a lawyer, but a doctor. If your baby is sick, you have the right to choose the doctor. You can pick up the phone, pick up any Yellow Pages across America, look up in the Yellow Pages under ``physician,'' and then you can pick whoever you want. Under our bill, you can call them up and say: Do you take a check? Do you take MasterCard? Do you 
   take Visa? 
   If you are covered under our plan, you have the right to choose a program that will let you choose a doctor. So if you think your HMO is doing a good job, you can stay in your HMO. But if you do not think they are doing a good job, you do not have to wait in line to talk to a bureaucrat, you do not have to hire a lawyer, you just simply say to them: You are not doing a good job, and you're fired. 
   If you like Senator KENNEDY's freedom, you want his bill. If you like our freedom, then you want our bill. 
   What is real freedom? It is the right to choose. 
   I thank my colleagues for their patience. 
   I see the leader is here on the floor. I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. If I may, what I first have here is the Kennedy bill that we call the Clinton health care bill which, as our leader will remember, we debated on the floor for 2 years. This bill was their bill where, if we would just force every American to go into a health care purchasing collective and let Government make the decision for them, they were going to guarantee that everybody would have coverage. This is what they wanted 3 years ago. We defeated that because we did not want our mama talking to some bureaucrat when she got sick. 
   What they want to do is set up a system where if you have a patient who wants to be in the room with their doctor, they find themselves in a room with their doctor and a gatekeeper. Senator KENNEDY would help them by putting a bureaucrat and lawyer in the examining room with them.

   Mr. GRAMM. You might have to wait in line and fill out a lot of forms, but they will be there, potentially, to help you. Then if that does not happen, you can hire a lawyer, you can choose any lawyer you want, and then you can sue. 
   Under our bill, what we do is we get rid of this. Under our bill, we give you this. What we let you do, if you are not happy with your HMO, instead of fooling around with a bureaucrat and lawyer, you just simply say to your HMO: You're fired. You set up a medical savings account, where for care beyond $3,000 a year you have an insurance policy; and then you and your employer put money in, up to $3,000 a year, out of which you pay medical expenses, through a check. These are various medical savings accounts that are now available through MasterCard and Visa. 
   So what it enables you to do is, if, at the end of the year, you did not spend the $3,000, it belongs to you, and you spend it on other things.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I congratulate our dear colleague from Florida, the distinguished chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, for his remarks. I identify myself with what he said. 
   The steel quota bill is a trade war starter and a job killer. It is imperative that this bill be defeated on the floor of the Senate today. Let me just try to outline a few reasons why I think that is absolutely essential. 
   First of all, America is the world's largest steel user. We have 40 times as many jobs in America using steel as we have jobs in making steel, so if we decide we are going to effectively, through this quota, impose a tax on steel, for every 1 worker we help we are going to hurt 40 workers. In fact, it has been estimated that to save one job through protectionism in steel it will cost Americans about $800,000. 
   How can it make sense to impose a cost of $800,000 to save a $50,000 or $60,000 job? It makes absolutely no sense. It would be an irrational decision for an individual or a family to make such a decision. And what is wisdom for an individual or family cannot be folly for a great nation. 
   You might ask yourself, if, in fact, everybody knows we have 40 steel-using jobs for every 1 steel-producing job--and we are debating imposing a quota on imports which will hopefully protect a few jobs while destroying many jobs--why are we doing it? We are doing it because the steel workers are very organized and are very tied in politically. That is what this is about. 
   The important thing to remember, however, is it costs not only about $800,000 per worker to protect a steel job, but because the steel quota is World Trade Organization illegal, it means that our competitors around the world, who will find these quotas being imposed on their steel, will be able to impose similar quotas and tariffs on American manufactured products, American agricultural products, American services that we sell around the world. 
   So the first point I want people to understand is that, by the most conservative estimate, when you take into account 40 jobs in steel using for every 1 job in manufacturing, when you take into account that this steel quota is illegal and therefore will produce countervailing quotas and tariffs against American products where we clearly are competitive on the world market, we are going to end up paying, as American consumers, over $1 million for every job in steel we might protect under this quota. 
   The next point I want to make is that the problem in steel is largely not imports. In 1980, we had 459,000 people employed in the steel industry. Today, we have 163,000 people employed in the steel industry. 
   You would think, in looking at these numbers, that steel production in America had fallen right through the floor; but, in fact, steel production since 1980 is up 56 percent. In fact, steel production in America was at an all-time high in 1997, even though we had reduced the number of people working in steel production from 459,000 to 163,000. 
   How do you reduce the number of workers from 459,000 to 169,000 and have production go up by 56 percent? You have that occur because of modernization and because of the implementation of new technology. In fact, since 1980, on average, America has reduced the number of people working in steel production by 9,000 a year, and they have done that not because of foreign competition but because of the implementation of new, modern technology. 
   Senator MACK mentioned it, but we have trade law section 201 that allows an industry that is suffering from foreign competition, where it can prove that job loss is due to the foreign competition, to get granted relief under current law. The steel industry, which has a record of filing more unfair trade practice suits and more complaints under the trade laws than any other industry in America, has not availed itself of 201. Why? Because if you look back to 1980, the primary reason they are losing jobs is not foreign competition. 
   In fact, in 1997 we had a record level of steel production in America--105 million tons. We had a record level of demand; hence we had a surge in imports and we had the demand because we are producing more cars, more trucks, more heavy equipment, and we are producing more washing machines, more dryers, more dishwashers than ever in history. And I can't think of a happier time, in terms of the economy, than we are looking at today. 
   In fact, in 1998--the last year we had data--steel production in America was near the all-time record, at 102 million tons. So the second point is that there is not a lot of data to suggest that the problem is with imports. 
   The third point I want to make is that the import crisis, if there ever was one, has passed. Steel imports are down from November 1998 to April of 1999--the last month we have data--by 28 percent. So if this ever was a problem, it is a problem that has largely been eliminated. 
   Finally, where is the evidence that the steel industry is on its back? The steel industry earned $1.4 billion in 1998. Of the 13 largest steel makers, 11 earned a profit in 1998. The bankruptcy of the three steel companies that are largely discussed as part of this bill, most analysts estimate, would have happened without regard to imports because of their high level of debt and because of the failure of investment that they made in new technology. 
   Now, no one is unconcerned when 10,000 Americans lose jobs in a year. That is a very real human story, and to be opposed to the quota bill is not to say that you don't care about the 10,000 people who lost their jobs. But it is important to remember that 9,000 people a year have lost their jobs due to technological change since 1980, and nobody wants to stop that change because it has created more jobs; it has produced better products; and it has produced products at lower prices, which have raised the real wages and living standards of every working family. 
   Finally, we are creating 7,500 jobs a day in America. We are the envy of the world. We are the world's most open market. We are the world's largest importer and, as a result, every day in America we are creating 7,500 new permanent, productive, taxpaying jobs for the future. We are creating them in industries that are going to grow and prosper, where these jobs represent jobs that will be there 20, 25, 30 years from today. Why in the world would we, the greatest beneficiary of international trade, want to start a trade war over 10,000 jobs when 9,000 of them were probably lost due to technological change, and in the process, jeopardize the creation of 7,500 jobs a day? 
   So the question we have to ask ourselves is: Do we want to risk 7,500 jobs a day in job creation in America due to being the world's greatest trading Nation? Do we want to put those jobs at risk for 10,000 jobs in the steel industry that will cost us over a million dollars, in terms of consumer cost, individually to protect? And, finally, there is no guarantee that technological 
   improvement will not end up eliminating these jobs in any case. 
   I think our choice is clear. I think we have to reject this bill. This bill will kill jobs. This bill will start a trade war, and since we are the greatest trading Nation in the history of the world, we will lose more than anyone else. So I urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill, and to vote no because we are the richest, freest, and happiest people in the history of the world because we are the one Nation in the world that believes in trade and practices it every day.  
   Why we would want to change our minds on trade in the midst of an economic boom that is virtually unprecedented in the history of the world is a great mystery to me. Why this bill is even on the floor of the Senate is a testament to the level of economic illiteracy in America. Why it would make any sense whatsoever to impose an effective tax on steel and destroy 40 jobs for every one job that you save is a great mystery, and only politics can explain it. 
   This is a bad bill. It could not come at a worse time. It is totally unjustified. It threatens the economic future of America, and I urge my colleagues to reject it.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in the last 12 months, America has created 1,950,000 new permanent, productive, tax-paying jobs for the future. We have created 7,500 jobs in every working day for the last 12 months. 
   If we want to continue to benefit from being the world's greatest trading nation, we have to have politicians that are willing to stand up and fight for those principles by saying no on bills such as the bill before the Senate. 
   Though the bill before the Senate may be well intended, the bill before the Senate is a job killer, a trade war starter, and it is a bill that will destroy 40 jobs in steel-using industries for every one job it saves in steel producing. 
   Last year, we exported $222 billion worth of products that used steel; 40 jobs were created in those industries for every one job in steel. It is estimated that the passage of this bill would save about 1,700 steel jobs at a cost of about $800,000 a job for the American consumer. But that is not counting the jobs we would lose in steel-using industries. It is not counting the jobs we would lose because of retaliation from our unfair trade practice. 
   If we want to create 7,500 jobs a day, we have to have the courage to stand up and defend the system that creates those jobs. 
   I urge my colleagues to resist the siren song of well-organized groups that have their special interests and look at the general interest of America. When we are creating more jobs than the rest of the world combined, more jobs than in all of Europe, Japan, China, and every developing country in the world combined, why should we be attacking the very system that created those jobs? 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this bill.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I first say to our colleagues that Senator NICKLES and I, who are on the other side of this issue, have been at the Finance Committee where we have been holding a hearing on Larry Summers, who has been nominated to be Secretary of the Treasury. As a result, it has taken until now for us to get the opportunity to participate. Because this is the most significant confirmation since either one of us has been on the Finance Committee, we did not have the luxury to miss that hearing. So if we have inconvenienced our colleagues by being late, I apologize. 
   I also say that one of the things that is always hard about our business--and our business is a noble business; it is American democracy at work--is that you do not get to choose your allies. 
    If I had an opportunity to choose my allies based on their ability and knowledge and persuasiveness, I would never undertake any battle where I did not have Senator BYRD and Senator DOMENICI on my side. The problem is that when the Lord handed out ability, He did not distribute basic philosophy and values and also a reading of the facts in the same way He distributed ability, at least from this Senator's own point of view. 
   I find myself, which happens from time to time and never creates happiness on my part when it does, fundamentally disagreeing with two of our most able Members and two Members of the Senate for whom I have a deep affection and a deep respect. 
   What I would like to do today is the following: I would like to try to outline the changes that I believe should be made in the bill. Let me make it clear that I am not for this bill. I see this as harkening back to another day, the days of the Carter administration, where we were basically trying to engage in industrial policy. I will talk more about that in a minute. 
   But if we are going to pass the bill, there are some things we should do--and I hope we will do--that could dramatically improve the bill. So what I would like to do today is talk about those amendments and try, for the convenience of our colleagues, to outline the amendments that I see that we would present today. 
   I can't speak for any other Member of the Senate. There may be others, besides Senator NICKLES and I, who have been working on these amendments together, who would want to come over and offer amendments. But to sort of give an outline, I would like to go through and outline what I think is wrong with the bill in terms of what could be improved by amendment. I would like to talk about each of those amendments and try to explain why they make sense so everybody would sort of get the lay of the land of the battlefield that we are likely to contest today and vote on today. 
   I would then like to try to talk about the problem in the steel industry, because Senator BYRD has spoken with such passion and conviction that, if you are going to oppose what he is trying to do, you have an obligation to explain why you disagree. So I will try to at least give you the view through the lens that I have in looking at this problem as to where I am coming from and why I think as I do. 
   Then it would be my proposal to either offer the amendments that I have outlined and simply have them there so anyone could debate them or, if Senator NICKLES comes over, then we could go back and forth. But it is not my objective to try to delay the process. It is pretty clear what I would like to at least have the Senate make a decision about today.

   Mr. GRAMM. I thank Senator DOMENICI and say, in complying with his wishes, that what I will do is simply go through and talk about four areas that I think we need to work on to improve the bill. Then I want to talk a little bit about the underlying amendment and about steel and about my different perspective on the problem than Senator BYRD has. 
   First of all, this bill has an emergency designation in it. What does that mean? What it means is this bill will be exempt, because of that emergency designation, from the budget caps that we set out in law and that we reinforced when we adopted the budget this year. To the degree to which that emergency designation allows us to spend beyond the cap, that expenditure will take money away from the budget surplus, every penny of which is Social Security trust fund money. 
   The way the bill is written, it is written in such a way that it does make some effort to try to deal with the cost of the program. In doing so, it is not effective, because it doesn't lower the spending caps to pay for this bill. 
   My first objection--without getting into all of the delicacies of the budget which aren't really important to this--is the following: We have a surplus today in terms of the books of the Government. But we do not really have a surplus in the sense that if we had to keep our books like the private sector does, where we had to take into account all the liabilities that we are incurring by guaranteeing Social Security benefits in the future, if we had to use what accountants call ``accrual accounting,'' we would be running a huge deficit. It creates a problem because now, as virtually everybody in America, I hope, knows, we are collecting more in Social Security taxes than we are spending on Social Security, so we are running a surplus and the Social Security trust fund would tend to grow as a result of that surplus. 
   But much to my distress, and I believe it would be distressing to the American people, if everybody understood it, it seems like weekly we spend more money, every penny of which comes out of Social Security, so that effectively we are plundering Social Security to pay for other programs. 
   Now, you can argue the merits or the demerits of this loan program. I will tend to argue the demerits. But even if you thought this program had great merit, I think it is bad policy, and wrong, to take the money out of Social Security to pay for it. 
   So the first effort that Senator NICKLES and I will undertake is that there is a budget point of order in the budget against any emergency designation for non-defense discretionary spending, when that discretionary spending would, in this case, take money out of Social Security. 
   So the first thing we intend to do, or at least we intend at some point during this process, is to raise that budget point of order to strike the emergency designation out of this bill. 
   Let me make two points about that. No. 1, it won't kill the bill. What it will  say is: You have to pay for the bill, because every penny you spend on these loan guarantees is money that you are not going to have to spend on something else. If we do not strike the emergency designation, then the money we spend on the loan guarantees will basically come out of Social Security; and since we have on several occasions, and will again, be debating whether or not to put the Social Security money in a so-called lockbox, I can't, in good conscience, keep voting to say we are putting it in a lockbox when we keep turning around and spending it. 
   I have a little bit of trouble taking a position one day that we are protecting Social Security money and, a day or two later, supporting spending it. 
   So the first issue we need to deal with is the issue of whether we should eliminate any possibility that this money would come out of Social Security. We can do that by raising the point of order that the bill has an emergency designation, and if that is successful, or if an agreement should be reached to simply take the emergency designation out, then any money this bill spends is money under the spending caps that can't be spent on anything else. 
   So if we are successful there, what we will have done is, for all those who believe this bill is a very good idea, or even a good idea, we will have set up a situation where it has to be paid for. I believe that is prudent public policy, and I think it should be done. 
   The second amendment we would be offering is an amendment to change the makeup of the board that will be making the loans. Let me remind my colleagues, and anybody else who is following this debate, that the reason these loan guarantees cost money is that we don't expect some of the loans to be repaid. The whole reason this loan guarantee package costs money--the reason we expect it to cost $140 million--well, that is the steel number. One of the reasons we expect this program, in total, to cost $270 million over the next 2 years is that we expect many of these loans not to be paid back. 
   That recognition leads to three changes we want to make in these loans, and they are the other three amendments. 
   No. 1, we don't think these loans ought to be made by the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Commerce. We believe we should have a board that is made up of people who have expertise in finance and who can guarantee two things: One, that we maximize the chances that the taxpayer will be paid back--I don't know how anybody can object to that--and, two, to the maximum extent we can, that we take politics out of the decisionmaking. 
   So a proposal we will make will be a proposal to change the board that will end up making the loan and overseeing the credit transaction, overseeing the payment of the loans when they are due, and the collection of the principal and interest. Rather than having the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Commerce, we would propose to have the chairman of the board of the Federal Reserve Bank and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and then have them, together with the Secretary of the Treasury, giving us a three-person board, all of whom will have expertise in finance and loans and investments. 
   So that we can try to achieve two objectives, both of which are important: No. 1, try to make the loans in such a way that we maximize the chances that they are going to be paid back, because that saves the taxpayers money. Secondly, to the maximum extent possible, we don't want politics to play a role in who gets these loans if you want them made. It is one thing to say they should be made, but it is another thing, I think, to set up a structure where we are almost guaranteeing that the announcements of these loans will be political announcements rather than financial decisions that are made where the board represents, in a fiduciary way, the interest of the American taxpayer. 
   So the second amendment we will undertake will be to change the makeup of the board to go to Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, as the effective chairman of the board; and then we will have the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Secretary of the Treasury serving on the board. I think by doing that we will maximize the chances of achieving our objective of maximum fiscal responsibility and minimum politics. 
   A third amendment we will offer is an amendment having to do with the maximum guarantee of a loan. It is virtually unheard of for the Government to guarantee 100 percent of the loan, because by guaranteeing 100 percent of the loan, we take any risk away from 
   the lender. If the lender is not responsible for any portion of the loan, the lender has no effective monetary interest in trying to see that the borrower has the ability to pay it back--has both the capacity and the will. In virtually every program in the Federal Government that I am aware of, loan guarantees are such that the Government does take on some of the risk in order to encourage lenders to lend, but it always--in virtually every case--leaves the lender with some residual risk, to try to encourage them to be responsible. 
   The proposal we will make is that no loan will ever be guaranteed for more than 80 percent, so that anybody who is making this loan will have to incur a risk of 20 percent. Needless to say, if you are making a $10 million loan and you are going to have to eat $2 million of it if it is not paid back, you are going to be a lot more judicious in making the loan than if somebody else is going to absorb the entire $10 million of loss if it is not paid back. 
   So I think this is simply a good Government amendment. Again, if you believe these loans should be made, then they should be made in a way that doesn't take money from Social Security, which has an oversight board made up of people who have fiduciary responsibility, and who have the expertise and knowledge related to it, and who won't be political; and, finally, the loans themselves should be such that the actual lender has some stake in the loan being paid back. 
   The fourth amendment we will offer today will be an amendment aimed at the minimum loan level. For some reason--and I don't understand it--the authors of this amendment have put a minimum on the amount of loan that could be made. The minimum is quite large. 
   So the net result of that, it seems to me, would be to tilt the lending toward specific would-be borrowers and to arbitrarily take loans away from small companies that might qualify but that might not be either willing or able to borrow the minimum amount. 
   So the fourth amendment we propose offering today would be an amendment that says we will strike the minimum amount and then we will let the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank Board decide, based on the applications that are available, who has the best creditworthiness, not who would be the biggest borrower. 
   So those are the four issues that, it seems to me, there should be relatively little debate about. 
   No. 1, don't take the money out of the Social Security trust fund. 
   No. 2, appoint a board of people who know something about lending and who will be good stewards of the taxpayers' money and who won't play politics in making the loans. 
   No. 3, don't guarantee 100 percent of the loan. 
   When a bank is making a loan, require them to undertake some of the risk. After all, they are going to get the benefits of the interest payments. 
   We propose not guaranteeing more than 80 percent of any loans. The additional advantage of that is that we could lend more money. If you think this lending is a good idea, then I don't see how you could be against spreading it more widely. 
   Finally, we strike the provision of the bill that sets the minimum amount, since there is no logic to saying that we will not lend to small business. 
   I mean, if there is any modern entity that has taken on the same political appeal that Thomas Jefferson's independent farmer had in 1800, it is a small independent businessperson. 
   If you think making these loans is a good idea, how can it make any sense to deny those loans to small business? 
   Those are the four amendments that we would like to deal with today. There are other amendments we are  looking at, but these four are so clear-cut and so necessary that I wanted to put them out on the table early this afternoon. 
   It is my understanding that perhaps Senator DOMENICI and Senator BYRD would want to sit down and talk about these. I think the sooner we can do that, the sooner we can start moving. 
   Finally, I want to respond to Senator BYRD on the steel issue in explaining how I see it so differently. 
   It is an interesting thing to me. The longer I live, the more I discover that when people disagree with you, there are almost two reasons. There is generally one of two reasons why they do, and sometimes both reasons. One is they have a different lens through which they see the world and view things and value things, and that leads to a different conclusion. Our founders, Jefferson, for example, recognized that good people with good intentions come to different conclusions. 
   But a second reason that people often differ is a different perception of the facts. 
   Let me just talk for a minute about the facts and why I believe that there will be disappointment if these loans are made, and why it is likely that to the extent that if the problem was real, it probably would not be solved by these loans. 
   Second, I want to argue that at least in terms of steel--I wish I could say the same about oil and gas--but at least in terms of steel I believe that the crisis is past. 
   Let me try, without holding my colleagues up, to just simply run through this real quickly.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me try to explain why I look at the steel problem and see it so differently than our dear colleague from West Virginia. 
   First of all, let me just review the facts that nobody disputes. 
   In 1980, we had 459,000 Americans who were employed in the steel industry. Today, we have 163,000 Americans employed in producing steel. So employment between 1980 and 1997 declined from 459,000 to 163,000 people. 
   If you just looked at that number, you would say, well, domestic steel production must be just falling completely through the floor; that we must have a disaster in the domestic steel industry. 
   The plain truth is that while employment fell from 459,000 steelworkers to 163,000 steelworkers, the production of steel in the United States actually went up by 56 percent. In fact, on average, since 1980 we have seen about a 9,000-job-a-year decline in the number of people working in steel production. Because of technological change, we are using fewer workers to produce more steel. 
   The complaint that is being lodged where it is being demanded first this week that we have the government guarantee loans to the steel industry and then next week where we impose a quota on steel imports triggering a trade war--remember, we have 40 people using steel in jobs for every one person making steel--all of that legislative effort is due to a belief that we lost 10,000 jobs this year in the steel industry. We have lost 9,000 a year every year since 1980. 
   One of the reasons, despite all of this talk about the rush of imports and unfair trade practices, that the steel industry has never filed a section 201 claim is in part because of an inability to demonstrate that the problem is imports. 
   In fact, in 1997 when we had the surge in imports, we had the largest domestic steel production in American history. In fact, in 1997 we produced 105 million tons of raw steel, which is an all-time record in steel production. 
   Why did imports surge in 1997 when domestic production was at an all-time high, where in fact some analysts believe that we had overcapacity utilization in 1997? What happened was the economy 
   was exploding, for which we all rejoice. We were creating 7,500 jobs a day, which still continues to this day. Thank God. As a result, people are buying cars at record rates, people are building houses at record rates, and we are approaching 70 percent of Americans who own their own homes. They are buying refrigerators, washing machines, and dryers. All of those products use steel. 
   We had a record level of domestic production and a record level of demand. What happened? We imported steel to fill the gap. 
   I think it is also important to note that in 1998, the last year where we have records, production was still near an all-time record with 102 million tons. In fact, the steel industry earned profits in 1998 of $1.4 billion. 
   I am not complaining about that. If I could snap my fingers and make those profits $10 billion or $14 billion, I would do it --or $140 billion. I don't have any objection to profits. 
   But the point I want to make is that in this period where the argument is being made that steel is collapsing and that we are being drowned by imports, other than on wire rod, no steel company in America filed a 201 complaint about imports producing a loss of business for them, or costing jobs in their industry. 
   When they don't file the 201 complaint, it suggests that they didn't have a case. 
   Here is the point I am making: 9,000 jobs a year have been eliminated because of technological change where production has grown by 56 percent. We are having the greatest economic boom in American history. We are creating 7,500 jobs a day. We have towns, and I'm very grateful that my hometown is one of them, where university students go after class to have a beer, and they have impressment gangs who come around and try to drag them off to factories. 
   We are creating 7,500 jobs a day. In the name of 10,000 jobs that were probably lost because of technological change, we are being called upon to go back to the 1970s, to the policy of Jimmy Carter, and have the Government start lending money where we are guaranteed in advance we will lose $270 million on the loans upfront. Of course, the default when Jimmy Carter was President was 77 percent. If we had that kind of default rate, the loss would be many times the $270 million.  
   We are creating more jobs in a day and a quarter than we are talking about, and we are jeopardizing those jobs by getting Government in exactly the kind of situation we are begging the Japanese to get out of: Getting America into crony capitalism, where we are trying to institute industrial policy, where Government is making decisions instead of the credit markets. 
   Second, we are getting ready next week under exactly the same heading to debate a provision that would literally start a trade war which could destroy millions of American jobs when there is not hard evidence these jobs have been lost because of imports. 
   Finally, as if all that were not enough, if the problem really existed, it has already been solved. American imports of steel have declined 28 percent since November of 1998. Russian imported steel is down by 96.6 percent; Japanese steel is down by 74.4 percent; Brazilian imports are down by 24.4 percent; and Korean imports are down by 46.8 percent. Imports from all countries are down dramatically. 
   Even if this was a problem, as normally happens in these political debates, we are a year late. 
   I am sympathetic to this problem. I am very sympathetic because my State is affected by these problems. The point is, we are not going to fix these problems by having the Government come in and lend money to an industry as it did when Jimmy Carter was President. 
   Some people said the other day that when Jimmy Carter was President, we had to do it because the inflation rate was in double digits and interest rates were at 21 1/2 percent. That is true. But were inflation rates in double digits and interest rates 21 1/2 percent because we had Government trying to run the economy? Isn't that what we changed in the 1980 election? 
   I don't want to go back to the policies of the Carter administration. This is 1999. That is why I am not for this provision. It is not because I'm not sympathetic to someone who lost a job in the steel industry. If that job was lost due to technological change--and the evidence is pretty overwhelming that it was--do we benefit anybody by lending money when we know that a substantial default on the loans will occur? 
   It seems to me what we need to be doing is to try to promote economic growth where people can find jobs and, hopefully, better jobs than they lost. When you have technological change in one industry that eliminates jobs and you have new technology in others, that creates jobs. 
   This is a tough issue. It is always easy and, I think, always tempting to try to say if anybody in America loses a job for whatever reason that the Government ought to do something about it. I remind my colleagues that in a day and a quarter we create more jobs in the private sector of the economy with the economic policies of open trade and private capital allocation and basic 
   free enterprise; we are creating more jobs in a day and a quarter than anyone is claiming that steel has lost in the last year. 
   We have to weigh this point. Isn't it distinctly possible under those circumstances that we could lose more jobs by starting a trade war or getting Government into industrial policy than we will save by doing those two things? Then those jobs might be lost anyway as a result of continued technological change. 
   It is because I am concerned about working Americans, it is because I am concerned about keeping this recovery going, it is because I want to keep creating 7,500 jobs a day that I am not for these loan guarantees. 
   I yield the floor.

This is not going to be the last one of these we do if we do this one. If we have already expanded this to iron ore, and we have steel and it was expanded in committee to oil and gas, does anybody doubt, if we pass this one, that 2 weeks from now, we are going to be back passing another one and another one and another one?

   Mr. GRAMM. The amazing thing is that we are getting the Government involved in allocating credit at a time when we are creating jobs at a record rate on net of 7,500 jobs a week. 
   Finally, I ask the Senator if he is aware that in a Los Angeles Times article in March, it pointed out there is expansion in the steel industry in that seven new plants will come on line this year, but each one of them, very interestingly, will employ 200 or fewer people. What is happening is, these small companies, with a small number of employees producing specialized products, are really outcompeting the bigger companies. 
   In looking at the assessments by Wall Street, they are bullish on steel in general, and the three companies which have gone bankrupt, they say have gone bankrupt because they are too highly leveraged and they bet on technology that did not pay off.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, you are going to hear an announcement in a moment from the two authors of the bill that is pending that we have worked out an agreement on the four amendments that were discussed earlier. I will leave it to them to talk about it. 
   It appears we would have this vote on an extraneous matter, and then either accept the vote on the four previous matters discussed or have a rollcall vote. But before we get into all of that, I wanted to say that I am supportive of the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona. 
   One of the problems we increasingly have in the Senate is that it is so hard to pass an authorization bill that we are reaching the point where almost every legislative action originates in one of two committees--the Finance Committee, which engages in direct spending through entitlements, and the Appropriations Committee, which appropriates money. 
   We have before us a bill that really should be under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. We are for all practical purposes appropriating without authorizing, or, one could say, authorizing within the Appropriations Committee. As I said to Senator STEVENS, maybe I ought to start reporting appropriations bills to the Banking Committee and try to bring them to the floor of the Senate. 
   But Senator MCCAIN's amendment really brings home a very important point; that is, we have committees that have jurisdiction in these areas. We undercut the Senate when we don't recognize it. 
   A policy, I think, that is ultimately quite independent of the issue we are talking about today but relevant to this amendment is that the sooner we can get back to having authorizing committees authorize and having appropriations committees appropriate the better off we will be. 
   I am in support of this amendment.

   Mr. GRAMM. I intend to vote with the Senator. I hope everybody will. Your amendment really makes the point that there is no end to the arrogance of people in Washington who are trying to tell people in a completely different part of the country, which they know nothing about, how to live their lives and claiming that somehow this bay belongs more to them than it does to people who have lived there for a thousand years. Not only are you representing your constituency, but you are speaking out on behalf of a concern, not in as clear a way, not in as glaring a way, but that many people in other parts of the country share. The last time I looked, there was no shortage of sea gulls on the planet.

   Mr. GRAMM. We have a bill before the Senate. Perhaps some believe the Government ought to be lending money to American industry; I don't, so I am not for the bill. 
   We have put together an amendment which I believe improves the bill. 
   No. 1, we strike the emergency designation so none of the money will come out of the Social Security trust fund. 
   No. 2, we set up a board made up of the Secretary of Commerce, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Alan Greenspan would be Chairman. It is a major move towards taking politics out of the determination of who gets the loan. 
   We require that the lender put up 15 percent of the capital, take 15 percent of the risk, so that the Government does not end up eating the entire loss if there is a loss. Obviously, if you are lending money, you are going to have to make up part of the loss; you will do a better job than if you are lending somebody else's money. We take the minimums out of the bill, so small business can compete for the money. 
   Finally, we have agreed on language that will put a focus on trying to make loans to maximize the chances that the loans will be paid back and, to the maximum extent possible, take politics out of the process. 
   This does not make it a good bill, in my mind. I am not for it, but I think it improves it. 
   I thank the two authors of the bill for working for people, who were not for their bill and were not going to vote for it, to try to make it better. I thank my colleague for giving me an opportunity.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think some explanation is due of how we came to be where we are and the circumstances under which this bill is being considered. 
   When the bill was reported from the Finance Committee, it was funded by changing the Tax Code in a way that would have produced additional revenues--by conventional definition, that would be a tax increase. 
   I felt at a time where we find it virtually impossible to control discretionary spending, at a time where in the same day--as was the case yesterday--we vote to secure in a lockbox the surplus that is coming from Social Security and then an hour later we vote to break the lockbox open and spend $270 million of Social Security money to subsidize loans to the steel industry, it was a very bad precedent to set at this point in this legislative session where we are coming closer and closer to blowing the top out of discretionary spending in the Federal Government to create a brand new entitlement, no matter how meritorious, and do it by raising taxes. 
   As a result, we had a series of objections to efforts to bring this bill to a vote. Many of those efforts were in the waning hours of various periods of the session before we adjourned for recesses. I have insisted on one fundamental thing which is now embodied in the unanimous-consent request that we have used to bring this bill to the floor; that is, that it be paid for, and that it be paid for by cutting another entitlement program; that it not be paid for by raising taxes. 
   Now, I have no objection to the bill itself. In fact, I congratulate Senator JEFFORDS. I congratulate the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH. I congratulate the ranking member, Senator MOYNIHAN, not only for putting together a good bill but being willing to go back and refine that bill to deal with legitimate concerns that were raised, and produce a situation where I assume this bill will pass unanimously. 
   My objection has never been to the bill itself because the policy embodied in the legislation itself is meritorious. The problem is, there are many meritorious proposals that can be made. At a time when we cannot seem to control discretionary spending, if we start in our first new entitlement program of this session to fund it by raising taxes, I think we create a precedent that could be very harmful to the economy and could ultimately drive up interest rates and threaten the recovery. 
   So, what we have done is ensure that there is no tax increase or any revenue measure in this bill. We have a unanimous-consent agreement that this bill cannot come back to the Senate in this or any other bill unless it is paid for by cutting another entitlement program. So the one thing we can be guaranteed is, in meeting the goals of this meritorious bill, what we are going to be required to do is do what families would have to do if they came up with a good thing to spend money on, and that is we have to go back and find another entitlement that is less meritorious, and we are going to have to find money from one of those other entitlements to fund this bill. I think that is the right way to do it. 
   I thank my colleagues for their patience. I know the bill is supported by a lot of people, and they should, because these are people with disabilities who are trying to work. 
   It has not been easy to stand in the way of this bill. I thought the cause was an important one. I am very happy with the final product. I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill. I assume it will get 100 votes, and I think we are doing it the right way. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, out of courtesy for our colleague from New Mexico, I will go ahead and speak now. 
   First of all, let me make a couple of things clear. No. 1, this bill contains an emergency designation so that not one penny of the funds expended under these loan guarantees will count toward the spending caps. 
   What that means is that in the next 2 years alone, in the years 2000 and 2001, that is $270 million, over a quarter of a billion dollars, if optimistic assumptions about defaults contained in this bill hold up, $270 million, over a quarter of a billion dollars will come directly out of the Social Security surplus. 
   Supposedly, there are offsets for cutting travel and furniture, but the spending caps are not reduced by that amount. So that money, if in fact those cuts were ever made, would end up being spent on something else. The spending in this bill is designated as an emergency, which means every penny of it will come out of the Social Security surplus. 
   We just had a vote about an hour ago where we said we want to stop the plundering of the Social Security trust fund. We do not think Congress ought to be taking Social Security money and spending it on other things. In fact, Republicans have been pretty self-righteous about it. We have held up our little lockboxes, and we have had press conferences. The problem is we hold these lockboxes up, but we keep supporting measures that knock the doors off, springs go flying, the combination thing goes rolling across the room. You cannot have it both ways. You either want to spend money or you don't want to spend money. 
   Nobody should be confused about the fact that this is paid for. The cuts don't lower the spending caps. There is an emergency designation; $270 million minimum in 2 years will come right out of Social Security. 
   We are turning the clock back. The last time we had the Government making loans to business, engaging in industrial policy, was when Jimmy Carter was President. Someone earlier today tried to make an argument that we were doing all of these things because the inflation rate was double digit at the time. Did anybody ever think the inflation rate got to be double digit because we did all of these things? 
   In a period of record prosperity, what are we doing having the Government override the decisions of the marketplace? 
   We do have laws against dumping, and those laws are being vigorously enforced by this administration. Some would say overly enforced. But there are avenues to deal with dumping, and those avenues are being addressed. 
   The last time we guaranteed loans to American industry and to the steel industry in particular, 77 percent of those loans were defaulted. If that happens here, every penny of that is coming right out of the Social Security surplus. 
   This is popular. I am from an oil State. There are going to be people who say $500 million of loans could just do wonders for us. But we are not paying for this. You take out the emergency designation, you change this bill, because then you get cuts in other spending to pay for it. 
   I think we have to make a decision. We have to decide which side we are on. You cannot be for not plundering the Social Security trust fund and be for this bill. So while obviously my State, and the State of the Senator from Oklahoma, would be beneficiaries from some of these loans, we can't have it both ways. We can't stand up an hour ago and say: Don't plunder Social Security, and then an hour later say: Well, if it is for a good reason such as providing loan guarantees for steel and oil, it is OK to plunder Social Security, but it is not OK in the abstract. 
   I can't turn corners that quickly. I can't change sides on an issue in an hour. 
   I do not want people to be confused. This bill has an emergency designation. It will waive the cap for the spending. There are offsets in budget authority, but they do not match up with the spending. There is no lowering of the spending cap to enforce the savings. The truth is, every penny spent from the year 2000 when this program starts until it ends will come directly out of the surplus and, for the next few years, every penny of it will come directly out of the Social Security surplus.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as you know, it takes unanimous consent to allow the Murray amendment to come forward. Any person can object, because you have two amendments pending. I have, I believe, worked out an agreement with the distinguished ranking member to have the vote on the reconsideration of the amendment, where there was a tie vote yesterday, occur either at 5 or after the disposition of the Kerrey amendment, whichever is sooner. If that could be added to your unanimous consent request, I think that would be agreeable to both sides. I have no objection to Senator MURRAY bringing her amendment up. I simply do not want to leave this matter pending past 5 o'clock, if we can avoid it.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, all I want to do is work out a time to bring up a vote that we are not even going to debate on. I will be happy to have it either after the Kerrey amendment or at 5 o'clock. There is some concern here about limiting a second amendment, apparently, on the Kerrey amendment. I do not have a dog in that fight. 
   We are in a position where I can't exercise my right, because we have two amendments, now three amendments, that are pending, which makes the floor manager sort of a gatekeeper. But it also makes anyone else a gatekeeper. All I am asking is if I could get an agreement on a time certain basis and/or following something else. I am not trying to be difficult to deal with; I just would like to work this out before we go on. 
   If 5 o'clock is all right, we can stop whatever we are doing at that point and have the vote. I do not even require any more debate. I just want to settle this issue. I would have to object.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, may I just suggest that we set the vote at 5 o'clock and leave the Kerrey amendment alone? The net result is the same. The Senator was willing to agree a moment ago to do it. If the Kerrey amendment is what is in dispute, it seems that it would have produced this result before. So I just urge my friend from Michigan to allow us to settle the issue. We are going to do it without intervening debate. But the problem is that I have privilege under the rules of the Senate, and that is being precluded by the stacking of amendments that require a unanimous consent request.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I commend the manager of the bill, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, for including in this legislation a one-year extension of the Defense Production Act. As the Senator knows, the Defense Production Act falls under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
   The Defense Production Act is due to expire on September 30, 1999. The Banking Committee has a great interest in the Defense Production Act and we intend to conduct a thorough review when we consider its reauthorization. However, due to the press of other business, specifically the time-consuming task of passing the first modernization of our financial services laws in sixty years, the Banking Committee is unable to conduct such a thorough review at this time. 
   Therefore, I requested that Senator WARNER include a provision in the Department of Defense authorization bill to extend the Defense Production Act until September 30, 2000. This extension will allow the Banking Committee the time to give the reauthorization of the Defense Production Act the attention it deserves. Senator WARNER was kind enough to include this provision at my request.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have the highest regard for Senator ROTH, our distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. One can tell by looking at all the books on his desk that he has done considerable research in this area. I have not done similar research in this area. But this is an issue that I have followed for my period of service in Congress, and I have followed it in part because of an interest in it, and in part because of my interest in the efforts of Dr. Samuel Mudd to exonerate his name from the role that he is alleged to have played and in fact was convicted of playing in the post-assassination activities related to President Lincoln. 
   But I have come to the floor today to oppose this amendment because I strongly object to Congress getting into the business of rewriting history. 
   This is an old issue. There has been a lot of talk over the years about Admiral Kimmel and about General Short, and about the facts in the wake of the greatest military disaster in American history at Pearl Harbor. And there is no question about the fact that we were asleep on December 7th of 1941. There is no question about the fact that Kimmel and Short had a great shortcoming in that they did not talk to each other and put together the information they had. But there is probably no question about the fact that in the wake of that disaster, there was an effort to put the blame on someone. It is also true that subsequent studies have concluded there was broad culpability. 
   But here is the point I want to make. We have a Board for the Correction of Military Records. We have an on-going process within the Department of Defense to reevaluate decisions that have been made. This decision about Kimmel and Short bubbled all the way up to President Bush, who as you know, was the youngest naval aviator in American history in World War II. 
   President Bush decided to let contemporaries be the judge of historical events, and so he made the decision not to override the decision of military leaders at the time of Pearl Harbor. 
   We had another review that ended on December 15th of 1995. That review was headed by Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Edwin S.  Dorn. Dorn concluded that, while it was clear that there was broad culpability, there was not sufficient evidence available now to override the previous decision, which did not include court-martial of these two military leaders; it simply included retiring them at their permanent rank rather than their temporary rank. 
   Some of you will remember this issue because we went through it with a four-star admiral when there were questions about the abuse of women on his watch in the Navy. Some of you will remember that we actually had to cast a vote in that case. The issue was whether he should retire at his permanent rank, which was a two-star admiral, or as a four-star admiral. We had a very close vote on the decision to allow him to retire with his four-star rank, which he held on the day he left the military. 
   It is true that normally, military flag officers are allowed to retire above their permanent rank to the higher temporary rank held on the day they are severed from the military. But that is not always the case, and it is normally done as an indication that they have provided excellent service. 
   It was not an extraordinary thing in the wake of Pearl Harbor to, No. 1, retire the two officers in charge and, No. 2, retire them at their permanent rank rather than elevating their rank upon retirement. 
   I urge my colleagues, with all due respect to Senator ROTH, to let history be the judge of what happened at Pearl Harbor. We have a process within the Defense Department where recommendations can be made, where facts can be gathered on an objective basis, where the review can come up to the level of the Secretary of Defense and then come to the President, if necessary, to make a final decision. President Bush refused to override the judgment of history. The Clinton administration, through Under Secretary Dorn, has refused to override the judgment of history. 
   Now, there is no doubt about the fact that Senator ROTH believes he is sufficiently knowledgeable about this case to override the judgment of history here. But I ask the other 99 Members of the Senate, are we sufficiently informed? Do we want to set a precedent here or build on precedents, bad precedents in my opinion, that have been set in the past, of trying to write history on the floor of the Senate? I think we need to leave it to the official process. We need to leave it to historians to make these judgments. 
   I have been personally involved now for several years with the Dr. Mudd case. What has happened in that case is that Dr. Mudd has many influential heirs and they have set a goal of exonerating him. We now have gone through this extraordinary process where we literally are on the verge of making a decision, where the Federal courts have gotten involved, not on the issue of whether Dr. Mudd was guilty. Having met John Wilkes Booth three times, being a physician whose job it was to recognize traits in people, he supposedly treated John Wilkes Booth and never recognized him. Contemporaries at the time said no. As a result, they sent him to prison. He was later pardoned due to some of the good work he did in prison. Never again in his lifetime did he challenge the judgment. But yet now we are on the verge of having, because of the political influence of that family, a decision in the Defense Department to override history. 
   I think we make a mistake by doing that. In this case, we have had a judgment by President Bush, a naval aviator, a hero of the very war where this decision was made, who decided not to rewrite history. 
   I think we should not decide to rewrite history here today. I think this amendment is well intended and based on tremendous research and on a great deal of fact. The point is, we are not the body that should be making this judgment. There is a process underway. That process has come to the level of the President once; it has come to the level of the Under Secretary of Defense once; and in both cases, they have said they would allow the judgment of history to stand. 
   It is not as if these two military leaders were court-martialed. They were simply retired, something that happens every day in the military. And they were retired at their permanent rank, which is not ordinary but it is certainly not extraordinary. 
   What should be extraordinary is that retirement at temporary rank ought to be a reward for conspicuous service. And while each of us can make our judgment about history that occurred in 1941, almost 58 years ago, I do not believe we have the ability, nor do I believe we have the moral authority as a political body, to go back and rewrite history. I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Senator LEVIN and I every year or two have this debate. It is well known. We have debated it before. People have voted before. In fact, 61 Members of the Senate voted with me 2 years ago to substitute a study for the Levin amendment. 
   Let me add, the amendment is a little different than it was then. The thrust of it is basically the same. Two years ago, the Levin amendment applied to all procurement related to the prison industry system. This year, it applies to only defense procurement. But while its focus has narrowed, its impact on the work system within our prisons remains very broad. 
   I remind my colleagues that we took up this issue on July 10 of 1997. There was a vote at that time, and 62 Members--61 of whom are still Members of the Senate--voted on this issue on a different day in a slightly different version. But the thrust of the issue, in terms of procurement from the Federal prison industry system, is and was basically the same. 
   Let me set out what I want to do in my opening statement. I want to try to explain the problem in historical context, and I want to begin with Alexis de Tocqueville. Then I want to come to the Depression, which was really fork in the road with regard to prison labor in America. I want to talk about the fork we took, the wrong fork in my opinion. I want to talk about how the Levin amendment fits into the system which has evolved since then. I want to talk about why this provision by Senator LEVIN, which Senator HATCH and Senator THURMOND and I hope to strike from the bill, is so devastating to the prison industry system in America and why that, in turn, is harmful to every taxpayer, to every victim of crime, to everyone who wants prisoners rehabilitated when they go back out on the street. In fact, there is no good argument, it seems to me, when you fully understand this issue, for the Levin amendment. I then want to talk in some detail about each of these items and then, obviously, at that point we will begin the debate. 
   Let me start with de Tocqueville. As many of my colleagues will remember, de Tocqueville came to America in the 1830s. He wrote a book that has become the greatest critique of America ever written--``Democracy in America.'' We forget that de Tocqueville came to America not to study democracy but to study prisons. In fact, he wrote a book on prisons, together with a fellow named Beaumont. We have forgotten Beaumont, but we remember de Tocqueville. 
   In his analysis of American prisons, which were very much studied in the 1830s because they were part of the most enlightened prison system in the world, de Tocqueville praised at great length the fact that we required American prisoners to work. In that period, prison labor of 12 hours a day, 6 days a week was the norm. De Tocqueville says in his analysis on American prisons:  
   It would be inaccurate to say that in the Philadelphia penitentiary labor is imposed. We may say with more justice that the favor of labor is granted. When we visit this penitentiary, we successively conversed with all its inmates. There was not a single one among them who did not speak of labor with a kind of gratitude and who did not express the idea that without the relief of constant occupation, life would be insufferable.  
   The principal characteristic of the American prison system in the age that Alexis de Tocqueville wrote that remark was that prisoners worked and they worked hard. They helped pay for the cost of incarceration by working, and they produced things. Those products were sold on the open market in many cases. So the first obligation for feeding prisoners and incarcerating prisoners was borne not by the taxpayer but by the prisoner and, as de Tocqueville argues, I think quite impressively in the book and in the quote I used, prisoners actually benefited from labor because of the extreme boredom of being incarcerated with nothing to do. This was the norm in America from the 1830s, when Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, for 100 years, until the 1930s. 
   What happened in the 1930s was that we passed a series of laws driven by special interests, principally labor and business, and you cannot get bigger special interests than that. These laws consisted basically of the following laws: the Hawes-Cooper Act which authorized States to ban commerce in prison-made goods within their borders; the Sumners-Ashurst Act which made it a Federal crime to transport prison-made goods across State lines; and then another provision that said not only can you not sell what prisoners produce, not only can you not transport it for sale, but if you do force prisoners to work, you have to pay them the union scale set by the local union. 
   Guess what the result of those three laws was. The result of those three laws was that we destroyed the greatest prison industry system that the world had ever known. We destroyed that prison system by eliminating our ability to force people in prison to work; and in doing so, force them to pay for part of the cost of their incarceration; and we eliminated our ability to collect from them part of what they would earn working in prison or what would be earned by their work to pay for restitution to victims of crime. 
   What was left after we destroyed the ability of American prisons to force prisoners to work was the ability of prisoners to produce things that were used by Government. As a result, we now find ourselves in a situation where we have 1,100,000 Americans in prison. They are almost all male. They are almost all of prime working age. We spend $22,000 a year keeping people in prison, which is nearly the cost of sending somebody to the University of Chicago or to Harvard, and the cost of keeping Americans in prison costs the average American taxpayer $200 a year in taxes--just to keep people in prison. 
   The impact of the Levin amendment--I am sure he is going to gild this lily with lots of gold around the edges--but the impact of his amendment is to take another major step in destroying prison labor in America. What his bill would do is, for all practical purposes, take away about 60 percent of the work that Federal prisoners do now. 
   There are, obviously, two sides to these arguments. You can argue that  when people are working in prison that there is someone else who might benefit from getting the job if the prisoner were not working. It is hard to make that argument in America today when we have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years and when, in towns like my hometown of College Station, college students go out and relax after classes and impressment gangs come and virtually knock them in the head and drag them off to a factory. So if there ever was an argument here that we needed to take away prison work to protect American jobs, it is very hard to make that argument in May of 1999. 
   But here is the system we have now. We have a system called Federal Prison Industries where the Federal Government has work programs for prisoners. It pays them a very small incentive payment. It withholds about 20 percent of that payment as restitution to victims of the crimes they have committed. It produces component parts for various things used by the Government. It produces furniture, it produces some electronic components. Through this system, we have about 20,000 Federal prisoners who work. 
   Under this amendment, about 60 percent of that work would be taken away. Not only do I oppose this amendment, but the administration, in its Statement of Administration Policy on this defense bill, on page 3, ``Federal Prison Industries Mandatory Source Exemption,'' opposes the Levin amendment. 
   I have a letter here from the Attorney General. Among other things, she says:  
   I am extremely concerned about this legislation because it could have a negative impact on [the Federal Prison Industries], which is the Bureau of Prisons most important, efficient, and cost-effective tool for managing inmates and for preparing them to be productive, law abiding citizens upon release from prison.  
   I also have a letter from the National Center for Victims of Crime. And they say, among other things:  
   Dollars that go to the crime victims through the [Federal Prison Industries] program are coming out of criminal offenders' pockets--the notion that the offender must be held accountable and pay for the harm caused by crimes he [or] she committed is at the heart of jurisprudence. Crime victims often tell us that the amount of restitution an offender pays is far less important to them than the fact that their offender is paying restitution. Financial assistance from offenders has a tremendous healing and restorative power for criminal victims. 
   No. 1, the administration opposes the Levin amendment, supports our effort to knock it out of the bill. The Attorney General, the Director of Federal Prisons, and the National Center for Victims of Crime all oppose this amendment. They all oppose it basically for the same reason; and that is, it will end up raising the cost of incarceration. It will end up lowering the amount of restitution going to victims. It will idle prisoners, and you do not get rehabilitated sitting around in air-conditioning watching color television. 
   If there is anything we know about the Federal prison work system, and about the work system in States, it is that working is an important part of rehabilitation. I personally would support proposals that would force every able prisoner in America to work. I would like them to work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, and go to school at night. But I know with the vested interest that is built up against that, that we cannot succeed in changing it today. I hope we will someday. But I do not want to destroy what we have now. 
   Let me talk about recidivism. 
   In South Carolina--and you are going to hear from the distinguished former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator THURMOND, a very active member of the Judiciary Committee. In South Carolina, the probability that a person who serves in a penitentiary in South Carolina, when they will be released, will ever come back into a State or Federal penitentiary again is 17 times higher for those who did not work while they were in prison than it is for those who did work in prison. Part of the reason is that people acquire skills in working that allow them to go out into the private sector and get a job when they get out of prison. 
   In Florida, the probability that a person in prison, when they are released, will ever come back to prison is three times as high for people who did not work while they were in the penitentiary in Florida as it is for those who did work while they were in the penitentiary in Florida. 
   For Wisconsin, it is twice as high; for Kentucky, it is almost twice as high. 
   In the Federal system, the recidivism rate, the chances that someone will come back to Federal prison, after having been released, is 24 percent lower for those who participate in work programs. We have estimates that a 10-percent reduction in recidivism rates would lower the overall social cost of crime and incarceration by $6.1 billion. 
   So another strong argument against the Levin amendment is that we have hard data, not just from the Federal Government, but from many States, that indicate conclusively if people work when they are in prison, the probability that they will go out and commit another crime that will get them sent back to prison is substantially, markedly lower if they work than if they do not work. 
   You are going to hear Senator LEVIN argue that, well, this is not price competition. And it is not. Let's make it clear, this is not a competitive issue. I would defy anyone to pick up this defense authorization bill and hold it out as a paragon of virtue in terms of defense procurement efficiency. 
   The defense procurement system is full of protectionism and special interests, where we give all kinds of special deals to all kinds of producers in selling things to the Defense Department. 
   I say competition in procurement is a good thing. I swear by it. I support it. But when you have page after page of acquisition rules that say we pay inflated prices to buy things domestically rather than buying them on the world market, it is hard to suddenly be concerned about competition in prices with regard to prison-made goods. 
   This is not about competition. This is about using a resource we have with 1.1 million people in prison. 
   Now, having said that, the GAO recently did a study of the Federal Prison Industries of 20 different products that were bought by the Defense Department. What the GAO concluded was the Federal Prison Industries prices were within the market range for virtually every product that was bought by the Defense Department. So it is true that in the strictest terms, we don't have competitive bidding on goods produced in prison, but we have market surveys. We have negotiations between the Defense Department and the prison, and we have a simulation of what the market system would look like if you had a competitive bidding system. 
   Also, the Department of Defense Inspector General recently completed a study of the Federal Prison Industries prices and concluded that DOD could have saved millions of dollars by buying more items from the Federal Prison Industries if it had bought more items from them rather than buying them in the open market. 
   Now, let me remind my colleagues--I know Senator THURMOND is here and is very busy; I want to give him an opportunity to speak--that 2 years ago, when we debated this same issue in a slightly different form with the thrust identical, I offered a substitute amendment that mandated a study be done by the Department of Defense and by the Federal Prison Industries and Department of Justice. That study has just been completed, and it was reported to the Armed Services Committee and then to Members of the Senate. I draw my colleagues' attention to page 4 of the executive summary to the conclusions that were reached in the study. 
   The question was what recommendations did they have as to changes we might make in current law with regard to the Defense Department buying things produced in Federal prisons. They concluded, the recommendations can be made within existing statutory authority and will not require legislative action. Department of Defense and Federal Prison Industries say they believe that implementing the recommendations will improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of procurement transactions between the two agencies. Implementation of the administrative actions should facilitate and enhance the working relationship between the two agencies. 
   So in short, 2 years ago when we debated this issue and we decided to study the problem that was raised by Senator LEVIN, we had that study completed jointly by the Defense Department and the Department of Justice,  the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and they have concluded that they should undertake a modernization system, but they do not need any legislative authority to do it. 
   I urge my colleagues to remember, if we adopt this amendment and we kill off 60 percent of the remaining prison labor in America, we are going to spend more money to incarcerate prisoners. We are going to have less money go to victims. We are going to have a higher recidivism rate as people come out of prison and commit crimes again. And the net result will be that we will have taken work that was being done in prison, and we will have put it into the private sector. But in a period when we have an acute labor shortage and in a period when we have 1.1 million people in prison, 1 percent of the labor force, it makes absolutely no sense, it is destructive of our criminal justice system to destroy the remnants of prison labor. 
   I remind my colleagues that when you bring Senator THURMOND, 
   Senator HATCH and myself into an alliance with the administration, into an alliance with Janet Reno, the Attorney General, and then you have the support of victims' rights groups all over the country, that is a pretty broad coalition. What each and every one of these entities is saying is, do not kill off prison labor. 
   When we have 130 million Americans who go to work every day and struggle to make ends meet, I do not understand what is wrong with forcing prisoners to work. I want prisoners to work. It is good for them. It is good for the taxpayer. It is good policy, and we should not allow that system to be destroyed. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time, but I yield whatever time he might need to our distinguished colleague, Senator THURMOND, who today was recognized for the 75th anniversary of being commissioned an officer and a gentleman in the U.S. Army. For 75 years, three quarters of a century, Senator THURMOND has borne that commission to uphold, protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and whether it was on D-Day in Normandy or whether it was on the Supreme Court of South Carolina or whether it was Governor or whether it is our most distinguished Member of the Senate, STROM THURMOND is truly a man to hold against the mountain and the sky. 
   I yield whatever time he might need to Senator THURMOND.

   Mr. GRAMM. I do not want to throw off the vote, but I made an opening statement. I had several other of my colleagues speak on behalf of my amendment more articulately than I was able to, and I am grateful, but I would like to have 4 minutes to sort of answer some of the points that have been made. It just turned out, because people that were for the amendment came to the floor, that they all spoke before any of those that were opposed to it had the opportunity to speak. So if it doesn't mess up our timetable, I would like to have 4 minutes to respond to some of the issues that have been raised.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, let me make it clear, the Defense Department does not support this amendment. The Defense Department issued a joint report with the Department of Prisons, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, outlining ways of improving the system that required no legislation. The administration, on behalf of the Defense Department and the Department of Justice, opposes the Levin provision and supports the amendment that we have offered to strike it. 
   The Attorney General supports our motion to strike the Levin amendment, as do many groups such as the National Center for Victims of Crime. 
   It is obviously a very strong argument with me to talk about, ``why not competition?'' The problem is, you have to understand the history that competition was the rule prior to the Depression. Prior to the Depression, virtually everyone in prison in America worked on average 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. But during the Depression, we passed three pieces of legislation, all of them driven by special interests, triggered by the Depression, which made it illegal for prisoners to work to sell goods in the market. There had been previous provisions so that they didn't glut the market in one area, but the problem is, now it is criminal for prisoners to work to produce anything to sell in America. 
   When my colleagues say why not have competition, my answer is, yes, let's have it. But you cannot have it without letting prison labor compete, 
   and now that is prohibited all over America. The only thing left for prisoners today is to produce things that the Government uses. That is the only thing that we have not prohibited by law. As a result, we have 1.1 million prisoners and about 900,000 of them have no work to do. 
   If the amendment of Senator LEVIN passed, 60 percent of the prison labor at  the Federal level in America would be eliminated because there would be no work for these people to do. So this is an argument about competition that sounds great until you understand that Government, driven by the same groups that support this amendment, eliminated the ability to use prison labor to produce and sell anything. 
   When you are talking about the taxpayer, it sounds great. But what about the taxpayer that is spending $22,000 a year to keep somebody in prison and we are not allowing them to work? If taxpayers are working, why are they better than taxpayers? Why should they not have to work? Why can't we find things in the private sector for them to produce? If we can do that, I would support this amendment. I know that many of the people who support it would never do that. 
   The Defense Department is not for this amendment. They are not for the Levin amendment. They are not objecting to the provisions. In fact, they just put out a joint report saying the Defense Department supports the program with these reforms, which they can undertake without legislation. 
   So, basically, I believe that the system is not perfect, but it is basically a good system where prices are negotiated and the Defense Department gets 90 percent of the waivers that they seek. If they don't think the quality is right or the price is right or the delivery is right, they can ask for a waiver. In 90 percent of the cases, they get the waiver. 
   This is basically an amendment, I am sad to say, that would idle 60 percent of Federal prisoners. It would allow private companies to come in and take the business. But the point is, when we have full employment in America and we have a million prisoners idle, how does it make sense to prohibit them from working? I thank my colleague for giving me this time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, obviously appropriating money is a very difficult task. I had the privilege for 7 years to serve on the Appropriations Committee. During that time I had the great privilege of serving as chairman of Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations. Probably more than most Members of the Senate who don't currently serve on Appropriations, I think I have some understanding of the difficulty our colleagues have in appropriating money. Let me also say that the funding issues are the most important and the most difficult issues we debate. 
   I will share with my colleagues and anybody who might be following the debate an experience I had in 1980. I was a second-year Member of the House and I had been an economist prior to coming to Congress. I kept noticing that on the issues that really mattered--the spending issues on amendments--we were consistently losing on virtually every one of those votes. I ran sort of a running total for about 6 months on those votes. 
   Here is what I concluded, as best I can remember. The average vote on spending that really mattered cost about $50 million. These were little add-on amendments that were voted on in 1980 in the House of Representatives. There were about 100 million taxpayers in 1980. So the average taxpayer was paying about 50 cents. The average appropriation amendment was costing about $50 million; there were 100 million taxpayers; so each taxpayer was having a cost imposed on them of about 50 cents. 
   As best I could figure, the average beneficiary was getting about $700. 
   Members don't have to have a degree in mathematics or any fundamental understanding of economics to understand that if you have 100 million people all losing 50 cents each, and then you have beneficiaries who are getting, on average, $700 each, it doesn't take a lot of imagination to understand why in 1980 we were losing on every spending amendment. The reason being, the average taxpayer could benefit only by 50 cents if the amendment were defeated. That wasn't enough to activate them to write a letter in opposition. The average beneficiary was getting about $700, as best I could figure, on these votes on amendments. For $700 they were willing to do quite a bit, especially through groups that represented them where they would have thousands of members, sometimes tens of thousands of members, who were getting $700 each. 
   So it very quickly became evident to me that we were fighting a losing battle on spending. That ultimately gave rise to our efforts to try to elevate this to a national issue where, rather than voting on all these little amendments that cost taxpayers 50 cents each, we could turn it into a big issue where we were talking fundamentally about the future of America, which is what budgets are about. And, in fact, in 1981 when Ronald Reagan became President, we were able to adopt a budget that dramatically reduced the growth in government spending, that reformed entitlements, and that cut taxes across-the-board by 25 percent. And I would argue, probably more than anything else, that and Ronald Reagan's opposition to regulations and the rolling back of burdensome regulations, and the monetary policy of the Fed, explained why we are in the happy condition we are in today with the current state of the economy. 
   But what I discovered in 1981 was the only way you can win on these issues is when you are debating the big issue instead of the individual spending program. The budget has become our way of trying to rein in spending. One of the vehicles we have in that budget process is spending caps, where we debate how much money we are going to spend on discretionary programs and we set it in law and then we judge spending based on that number that we have in fact set into law. In order to try to beef up our strength to try to hold the line on spending, we established budget points of order. In order to try to enforce them we established supermajority budget points of order, with 60 votes required in order to violate the budget. 
   I will, later today, raise a budget point of order against this appropriation bill. Why do I object to this appropriation? First of all, you cannot spend $14 billion beyond the spending caps in actual cash outlays, without doing a lot of things that almost everybody is going to be in favor of. But here is the basic problem. We set out, in 1990, in a budget agreement, a little loophole. I would have to say I was worried about it when it happened. But the loophole was allowing the President and Congress to get together and declare emergency spending, to designate spending as an emergency and therefore get around the binding constraints on spending that we had written into the budget. That provision went into effect in 1990. And in 1991 we declared $900 million of emergency spending. But in 1992, with the Presidential election, with the election of Bill Clinton, and with the fundamental change that occurred since then, here is what has happened to spending that we have annually designated as an emergency, and therefore outside the budget caps, and outside any binding constraint that we all solemnly voted for as part of the budget process. In fact, the spending levels that I will be trying to defend today with my point of order were adopted 98 to 2 on June 27 of 1997. Only two Members of the Senate voted against making the commitment to hold the line on spending. I am today going to be offering a point of order to try to hold the line on that commitment we made. 
   But here is what happened. Beginning in 1991 we had $900 million designated as an emergency in a government that was spending, in 1991, maybe $1.2 trillion. It was not very much money by comparison. In 1992, we declared $8.3 billion of spending to be such an emergency that it did not even count as part of the budget process; that it was exempt from the cap. By 1994 that number had grown to $12.2 billion that, in 1994, we designated as an emergency. 
   Because of our action at the end of last year in passing a $21 billion emergency funding bill, we have already violated the budget for fiscal year 1999 above the level that we committed to on June 27 of 1997. We have already violated that budget by $15 billion in budget authority, which is the portion of the $21 billion that the President has already released by concurring in the emergency designation. If we adopt this bill unchanged, as it is written and 
   now is before the Senate, we will declare another $14.8 billion in budget authority as emergency, which will mean that in 1999 alone, we will bust the spending cap by $29.8 billion, all of which will be designated as an emergency, and all of which will be exempt from our budgetary process. 
   First of all, isn't it amazing that we have seen the level of emergency spending grow in 1991 from $0.9 billion, to $29.8 billion? What this really shows is we have lost control of the budget  process. This loophole is literally destroying our ability to control spending. 
   What are these items that are declared as emergencies, items that were so critical that we had to pass an emergency supplemental appropriation in order to fund them? Let me just give you some of the ones from last year that have already busted the budget by $15 billion. Then I will give you a few from this year. Army research into caffeinated chewing gum; the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine; grasshopper research; manure handling and disposal; onion research--those are the kind of items that were included in the emergency measure that we passed last year that has caused us to violate this year's budget already by $15 billion. 
   Let me go over some of the items that make up this supplemental appropriation bill. ``National Public Radio, $48 million to purchase satellite capacity; $1.3 million for the World Trade Organization ministerial meeting in Seattle.'' Would anybody have us believe that we planned that meeting and we suddenly discovered, after years of planning, that we had to pay for it? Would anybody believe that this should suddenly be contained in an emergency bill? No. But what they would believe is we always knew we had to pay for it but we did not put it in the budget, knowing we would put it in an emergency bill and therefore we could get around spending constraints. 
   ``Filling up San Carlos Lake; the purchase of a post office and a Federal court house in Minnesota; modernization at Washington International Airport.'' Modernizing an airport is God's work, but does it belong in an emergency bill? Don't we fund that out of a trust fund? What is it doing in an emergency supplemental bill? ``Renovating the U.S. House page dormitory?'' I do not doubt that is meritorious. If I did a survey among the pages they might think it is a wonderful idea. But is suddenly the world going to come to an end if we did it in this year's regular appropriation? My guess is we will not spend a penny of it until this year's appropriation bill is enacted anyway, so why is it in this emergency appropriation? It's in this emergency appropriation so we do not have to count it toward the spending caps next year. ``$1.5 million for the University of the District of Columbia.'' Then there is funding for the majority whip's office--that is in the House let me make clear--and the House minority leader's office, $333,000 each. Why isn't that in the appropriation bill for the legislative branch of Government? Why are we not funding that through the normal budget process? The answer again is we put these things in emergency funding measures in order, basically, to take them out of the process. 
   Why does it matter? Why does it matter that we are getting ready to bust our spending caps by $29.8 billion? Why it matters is that every penny of that money is coming out of Social Security. We do not have a surplus today except for the fact that Social Security is collecting more money than it is paying out. In fact, Social Security is collecting $127 billion this year more than it will spend. We have already spent $16 billion of that on something other than Social Security. We are getting ready to spend another $14.8 billion from this bill on something other than Social Security. 
   The point is, if we had not passed the emergency supplemental bill last year, which ended up taking $17 billion away from Social Security in this year, we would have had in this year the first time ever in American history where we actually had a Social Security surplus available to either lock up in a lockbox so it could not be spent or use it to save Social Security. 
   We do not have that ability now because of the emergency bill we passed last year, and now we are passing another bill that will take $14.8 billion. 
   The point I am making is this: We cannot have it both ways. We cannot say we want to lock this money up for Social Security and spend it at the same time. You can say you want to spend it and that this spending is critical and that it is absolutely essential we fill up these lakes and build these dormitories and that we fund reparation payments to Japanese South Americans from World War II, that we repair high schools, which I never knew was a function of the Federal Government. 
   You can say those are emergencies and they are important enough that we are willing to plunder Social Security in order to fund them. That is a legitimate position. It is not one with which I agree, but it is a legitimate position. What you cannot do is say we are going to lock this money away from Social Security or we are going to use it to save Social Security and then turn around and spend it. It is not legitimate to do both. What we are trying to do in this Congress is say we want to save the money for Social Security and we are trying to spend it at the same time. 
   I do not hold myself out as being more righteous than anybody else, but that is turning a little more sharply than I can turn. I still remember the press conferences where we stood up and said we want to lock this money away. Here we are today spending it. 
   What am I trying to do in my point of order and what will it do? First of all, there is not a point of order under the budget resolution against defense spending. There is a point of order against nondefense spending. The tragedy of this bill is that we could have offset all the nondefense spending in this bill. There was a point at which, before we started piling on more and more spending, we could have, with $441 million, offset all of the nondefense spending in this bill, in which case we would not have had an emergency designation to allow us to spend beyond the budget. 
   A decision was made by the Appropriations Committee not to do that. They could have done it. The level of reductions in other programs would have been minuscule. But the basic response from the Appropriations Committee, with all due respect, has been: We are not going to pay for these programs, we are not going to offset them and, basically, if you don't like it, do something about it. 
   That has basically been the message, and people have been up front and honest about it. The only thing I know to do about it is to oppose the bill and to use the budget which we adopted and of which I am proud--it is the best budget that has been written since I have been in Congress or certainly the best budget since the Reagan budget. 
   The problem is, I do not see any willingness on the part of our colleagues to enforce the budget. It is as if somehow writing a good budget was enough. Every day I read in the paper, often from members of the Appropriations Committee, that they do not have any intention of living within these numbers. 
   Some people are saying: OK, let this $14.8 billion go and then the next time we will resist. If you are going to resist this never-ending spending spree and this plundering of the Social Security trust fund, you have to begin to resist. 
   We are averaging over $10 billion a year of spending we are not even counting as part of the budget, and I believe that has to end. 
   I am going to make a point of order which simply makes the point that under the budget we wrote earlier this year, any Member of the Senate can raise a budget point of order identifying emergency designations in nondefense areas that are not offset, and that in order to overcome that point of order, those who want to spend that money, those who want to take that money out of Social Security, will have to get 60 votes to waive that point of order. 
   I do not deceive myself into thinking we are going to get enough votes to sustain this point of order. I realize how the system works. But I think it is important that we begin to raise questions about what is going on in the Senate. I do not know how we are going to save Social Security if we keep spending the Social Security surplus, nor do I see how we are ever going to give tax relief if we----

   Mr. GRAMM. I get half the time on the motion to waive since I am against waiving. 
   Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the conference report contains nondefense emergency designations in violation of section 206 of House Concurrent Resolution 68. I send a list of those designations to the desk. There are 29 nondefense emergency designations in this bill that are in violation and that are subject to a point of order, and I raise the point of order against each of these 29 designations.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me be sure to clarify: There are 29 provisions in the bill that are subject to a point of order because they are not funded. 
   Let me explain to my colleagues what this point of order does and what it does not do. 
   This point of order does not kill the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. This point of order does not strike any funding measure in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. What this point of order does, by striking the emergency designation for these 29 unfunded, nondefense provisions, is that it will trigger an across-the-board cut in all nondefense programs to fund these items. 
   That across-the-board cut will fund $3.4 billion of unfunded programs. It will do it, according to the Office of Management and Budget, with a 1.25-percent across-the-board cut in discretionary nondefense programs. 
   Obviously, our bill--if this point of order is sustained--will differ from the House bill. Under the procedures of our budget the bill would go back to the House, which could adopt the bill with this point of order made and therefore require the across-the-board cuts to offset this new spending, or the House could amend the bill to throw out the point of order, and the bill would come back and we would vote on the bill again and see if we could sustain it. 
   So that is basically what we are doing. 
   This point of order does not kill the supplemental appropriation, it simply pays for it. It simply says, in the $3.4 billion of programs that are not funded, that under the Budget Act you can make a point of order that they are not funded, and insist on that point of order so that 60 Members of the Senate would have to vote to say we do not want to fund these programs, we want to bust the budget, and we are willing to take the money out of the Social Security surplus in order to pay for it--which is what you will be saying if you vote to waive this Budget Act point of order. Have no doubt about that. 
   If we sustain this point of order, there will be a 1.25-percent across-the-board cut in the same accounts, same section of the budget, nondefense discretionary, to fund these programs. The Appropriations Committee will have a decision at that point as to whether they really want these programs if they have to fund them. My guess is for many of them, they will not. My guess is, if you have to fund these programs, you will decide you do not really want them all. 
   Why have I made this point of order? And why is it important? Why it is important is that our budget is so different from real budgets in the real world. Every time we want to bust our budget, we say we have an emergency. But American families have emergencies every day. They are not able to bust their budgets. What we basically do here would be equivalent to a family--they have written out their budget, and they decide to buy a new refrigerator this year or they are going to go on vacation this year or they are going to buy a new car this year; and Johnny falls down the steps, breaks his arm. 
   The way the Government does it, they say: Well, that is an emergency, so we are going to waive our budget. We just won't have to count that as part of what we are spending. But that is not the way families work. Families have to sit back down around their kitchen table, get out an envelope and a pencil, and they have to figure out that if they have spent $400 setting Johnny's arm, they 
   are not going to be able to buy that refrigerator or they are not going to be able to go on that vacation. They do not like it, but that is what they have to do, because that is the real world. 
   All I am asking here is that on these $3.4 billion worth of programs, if they are so good and they are so important, let's pay for them. It is not as if we are going to do great violence to the budget of the United States if we are required to pay for it. We are talking about a 1.25-percent across the board reduction in order to pay for these programs. 
   My view is that if you really wanted these programs, you would be willing to pay for them. If you are not willing to pay for them, we ought not to be spending it. 
   So I want to reserve the remainder of my time and conclude by just saying this. If you meant it when you set those caps on spending, if you meant it when you said you want to lock away this money for Social Security or use it for Social Security reform, we have an opportunity today to save $3.4 billion that belongs to Social Security. It does not belong to general government. It does not belong to all of these projects we are funding here. It belongs to Social Security. 
   If you want to save that $3.4 billion for Social Security, if you want to lock it away or use it to save Social Security, vote to sustain this point of order. I hope my colleagues will vote to sustain this point of order, because I think it is important. I think if we do not stand up now, we will now be at $29.8 billion by which we have overspent the 1999 budget before we have ever passed a single regular appropriations bill--all in the name of emergencies.  
   So if we are ever going to stand up and stop this plundering of Social Security and stop this runaway spending train, we have to do it now. I urge my colleagues to vote with me if you want to protect Social Security and if you want to live up to the budget. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from New Mexico for helping me see that in an effort to derail this point of order that we didn't do something that could undercut the whole budget. I am very grateful for his help on that. 
   I want to disagree with the points that have been made by my two colleagues and do it in such a way as to not be disagreeable. 
   First of all, our dear colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, says that the violating expenditures here that are not offset are only sixteen-hundredths of a percent of overall Government spending. Well, my point is, if it is that small an amount of money, why don't we pay for it? In a budget of $1.7 trillion, we are in essence saying that $3.4 billion of nondefense spending is so important we are willing to violate the budget in terms of spending beyond our cap. But it is not important enough that we are willing to cut somewhere else to fund it? It seems to me if it is that important, we ought to be willing to pay for it. 
   As to whether the budget is out of control relative to much of the world, our budget is not out of control. I agree with our colleagues. I am not making a statement trying to send the stock market down at 2, nor do I think any statement I could make would be capable of doing that. But I am not comparing America to Honduras. I am not comparing America to Japan. I am comparing what America is doing relative to what Congress promised the American people we would do. 
   I do say that when we are spending, in emergency spending in 1999, three times as much as we have ever spent before, that suggests to me that something is out of control. As we all know, we read every day in the paper where Members are saying there is no way we can live up to these spending caps, and that this is only the beginning of our violation of the budget. My view is this ought to be the beginning of the fight to preserve the budget numbers we adopted. 
   Let me tell you how the budget is out of control. It is not out of control the way we keep our books, even though we are beginning to lose control by designating all the spending as an emergency. 
   But if we used accrual accounting, like American business has to, with Medicare and Social Security, we would be running huge deficits today. 
   I agree with our colleague from New Mexico. Many of our worst problems are in areas like Social Security and Medicare. But the point is, we have to have Presidential leadership, we have to put together a program to deal with those problems; and it takes a concerted effort to do that. But the one area that we can control by ourselves is discretionary spending. The point is, if we don't have the will to prevent $3.4 billion of new spending, how are we going to have the will to reform Social Security or Medicare? 
   In terms of comparing the checkbook of a family to a great nation and a great economy, I think it is a good comparison. In fact, Adam Smith once observed:  
   What is wisdom in every household can hardly be folly in the economy of a great nation.  
   Where can we find a better blueprint for fiscal responsibility than looking at working American families sitting around the kitchen table? The fact that they are dealing with thousands of dollars and we are dealing with billions of dollars doesn't fundamentally change things. They have to set priorities. They have to say no. And they have to say no to their children, the people they love, and to real needs. 
   All I am saying is that we need to say no more often so that working families can say yes more often. I want to save Social Security so we don't have to double the payroll tax. I want to save Social Security so we don't have to cut benefits for the elderly. But we can't do that if we keep spending the Social Security surplus. 
   In terms of across-the-board cuts, if it is not worth cutting to pay for, then why is it worth spending? If it is not worth taking it from a lower priority, is Social Security the lowest priority? Is taking this money out of the Social Security surplus of lower significance than funding all the thousands of other programs we fund? I don't think so. 
   The final point. This is a point of order under the Budget Act against the nondefense portions of this bill. I would have raised a point of order against all the emergency designations in the bill had the point of order existed. I don't want people to think this is somehow nondefense versus defense. I believe in a strong defense. My dad was a sergeant in the Army for 28 years 7 months and 27 days. I have voted for defense. I have helped write budgets that rebuilt defense. But I want to pay for defense. 
   I think where the difference is, I am willing to cut other programs to fund defense. But I don't understand why we are not willing to take it away from something else to fund defense but we are willing to violate our spending caps to fund defense. And if this war is so vitally important--let me make it clear that I don't see the vital national interest here. I don't see this as a vote on the war. But let me make it very clear, if this war is so vital, we ought to be willing to cut other Government programs to fund it. The idea that we ought to take the money out of Social Security to fund this war, I think, is wrong. 
   So, again, this is a hard issue. I don't doubt the sincerity of our colleagues who are trying to do a difficult job in writing these appropriations. But there are two reasons I am here making this point of order. No. 1, we busted the budget by $21 billion on the last day of the last Congress. We are already at almost $30 billion of busting it now. We have to stop this from happening at some point. Let's do it now.

    Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON and a number of other colleagues in the introduction of legislation which we believe will provide critically needed relief and assistance to our beleaguered domestic oil industry. 
   Our bill contains a number of incentives designed to increase domestic production of oil and gas. The decline in domestic oil production has resulted in the estimated loss of more than 40,000 jobs in the oil and gas industry since the crash of oil prices at the end of 1997. Our legislation will not only put people back to work, it will revitalize domestic energy production and decrease our dependence on imports. 
   I have sought relief for the oil and gas industry from a number of sources this year. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I strongly opposed the $4 billion tax which the Clinton budget proposed to levy on the oil industry. As my colleagues know, that tax is now dead. 
   Earlier this year I contacted Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and urged her to conduct a thorough review of our current policy which permits Iraq to sell $5.25 billion worth of oil every six months. The revenue generated from such sales is supposed to be used to purchase food and medicine but reports make it clear that Saddam Hussein has diverted these funds from their intended use and that they are being used to prop up his murderous regime. The United States should not be a party to such a counterproductive policy. 
   Senator HUTCHISON and I earlier this year introduced legislation which contained a series of tax law changes intended to spur marginal well production. The legislation which we introduce today contains those provisions as well as others, such as reducing the impact of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) on the oil and gas industry and relaxing the existing constraints on use of the allowance for percentage depletion. 
   I am looking forward to working with my colleagues in an effort to enact the legislation as soon as possible.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the Senate Banking Committee has worked on this bill for a long time. In fact, this has been a live issue in the Congress for over 25 years. We are making progress toward at least having the Senate act. I think no one is under any delusion about the fact that we have a lot of work to do. We have a conference, and we have a President who ultimately is going to have a say in this through his ability to veto. Obviously, at some point we are going to sit down with him in the process and listen to his viewpoint and see to what degree we can come together. 
   But I thought it was a good time in the process here in the Senate to take some action to try to clear out some differences that exist between proposals that Senator SARBANES made in committee and positions which were adopted by the committee itself. There are two areas in this amendment where we adopt the position of the Sarbanes substitute which was considered by the Senate yesterday. What I would like to do is to explain these differences and then give Senator SARBANES an opportunity to talk about it. 
   The first has to do with striking the FICO provision. It is always dangerous to try to do good things on an important bill. No good deed goes unpunished. I had a provision in the underlying bill which was trying to deal with a problem, and the problem is that we have two separate insurance funds and they have had very different insurance premiums; but we had set out an automatic pilot process to bring those two funds to the same insurance rate, with the idea that Congress, while this was happening, was going to end up merging the two insurance funds. 
   Well, as often happens, Congress ended up passing no bill related to merging the two insurance funds, and on the last day of the millennium, on December 31 of 1999, these two rates are going to be merged by law. And so I thought, well, this is a chance to have a good Government provision, so we will postpone that to give the conference and the Congress an opportunity to do what we said we would look at doing when we started merging these two rates. 
   It is clear now that there is sufficient opposition to this provision, and I am not sure where the votes would be if we tried to leave it where it is. But it seemed to me, with all the big issues we have to deal with in this bill, that it is not worth fighting this issue. And so the first provision of this amendment strikes the so-called FICO provision and allow current law to operate to assure that the insurance premiums of the two separate insurance funds for  deposit insurance will be harmonized on the last day of this year. 
   The second provision deals with antifraud provisions and with this emerging issue of privacy. I want people to understand that by adopting the provisions of the Sarbanes bill on privacy, I am not saying to the Senate, nor is Senator SARBANES, I am sure--and he will speak for himself--that this is the end of the debate. This is a very important issue. Privacy is a fundamental right that people have, and the question is trying to balance that right against the new technology which we all benefit from, and which we all find ourselves forced to operate within. It is not easy. This is a beginning. 
   What I want to say to Members of the Senate is that, as a gesture toward promoting bipartisanship, I want to move to adopt these provisions from the Sarbanes substitute. But I want to go further than that. I want to commit that the Banking Committee will hold hearings on privacy issues. I want to commit that we will hold those hearings in both the subcommittee and at the full committee level; that we will begin the hearings with testimony from any Member of the House or Senate who wishes to testify; that we will hold comprehensive hearings so that anybody who has a legitimate viewpoint or represents any group which has a stake in this issue would have an opportunity to testify and have their position heard. 
   Now, basically, in this amendment we make illegal a number of 
   practices, where basically people are engaging in fraud and dishonest behavior. In addition, we require a GAO report on financial privacy. The amendment requires that GAO, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal banking agencies, report to the Congress on the efficacy and adequacy of the remedies provided to prevent false pretext calls to obtain financial information and recommendations for any additional legislation to prevent pretext calling. 
   We have a Federal Trade Commission report to Congress on financial privacy. The amendment requires the Federal Trade Commission to submit an interim report to Congress on its ongoing study of consumer privacy issues. 
   We establish a consumer grievance process. I think one of the things which has happened to every Member of the Senate is that we now find, in the absence of an organized process, that people tend to call us when they have problems of this nature. What we want to do in this amendment is require the Federal banking regulators to create a consumer grievance process for receiving and expeditiously addressing consumer complaints alleging a violation of regulations issued under this bill. These are regulations in section 202 having to do with consumer protection. Each Federal banking agency is required to (1) establish a group within each regulatory agency to receive consumer complaints; (2) develop procedures for investigating such complaints, (3) develop procedures for informing consumers of rights they may have in connection with such complaints, and (4) develop procedures for addressing concerns raised by such complaints, as appropriate, including procedures for the recovery of losses to the extent appropriate. 
   This is not the end of the debate. This does not solve the privacy problems in America. But I believe Senator SARBANES is correct that this is the beginning of the debate. I have just touched on a portion of the provisions. He is more expert than I on them. But I believe they represent an important step in beginning the debate on this issue of privacy. 
   I think it is important we begin this debate on a bipartisan basis. Therefore, I have sent this amendment to the desk adopting the privacy portions of the Sarbanes substitute. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. Let me try to set the record straight in terms of this amendment. The argument on the amendment is very simple, and I think it will not take very long to make the case against the amendment. 
   First of all, we hear the statement made that the unitary thrift provision in current law is a loophole, that somehow commercially owned savings and loans have come into existence as a result of a loophole--hence, as Senator JOHNSON says, ``the unitary thrift loophole.'' 
   Let me remind my colleagues that a loophole had nothing to do with unitary thrifts. In 1967, the Congress passed the S&L Holding Company Act. That S&L Holding Company Act intentionally, after a very large number of hearings in the House and the Senate, intentionally placed into law the provision that allowed commercial companies to own and charter S&Ls. Congress did this for a very simple reason. In fact, the law said clearly, in black and white, the purpose of allowing commercial interests to own S&Ls, hence the creation of what we call a unitary thrift, was to encourage capital and management to come in to the troubled S&L business. 
   So this new ``loophole'' is no afterthought. This is no mistake. This is no provision that was created by accident. In fact, we had an entire bill, the S&L Holding Company Act, which is the Unitary Thrift Act. That was passed in 1967 after extensive hearings in both the House and the Senate where strong action was taken by both parties in support of this provision. 
   This is no loophole. This is no accident. This is a creation of Congress that came into existence through a well-reasoned, extensively debated law, and the decision was made to encourage commercial companies to put real capital, real money, and good management into S&Ls. 
   Let me outline the figures, to give Members the magnitude of the problem. There are 561 thrift holding companies. What is a thrift holding company? A thrift holding company is a company that may be in many different businesses, but it owns a thrift charter. These are 561 thrift holding companies that are engaged in some other business as well as the thrift business. Many are in insurance, many are in securities. There are 561 of them. 
   Mr. President, 22 are now owned by nonfinancial unitary thrifts. Therefore, 541 of these will be legal under this bill, because it is legal under this bill for an insurance company and a securities company to own a bank, so it will be legal to own a thrift. 
   What is the ``universe'' we are talking about here in terms of actual commercial interests that own thrifts? The universe is just 22--22 thrift charters that are owned today by a commercial  interest other than insurance and securities that will be able to own banks under this bill. 
   What is special about these 22 companies? What is special about it is that most of them came into existence during the S&L crisis. I remember vividly offering an amendment to assess the thrifts $15 billion to begin to close troubled thrifts, 3 years before that amendment ever passed. It was defeated in the Banking Committee. I remember Senator DODD voting with me on it; I don't remember exactly how the vote broke down, but I know we lost. During that period, we were desperate to try to get people to put money into troubled S&Ls to try to prevent the taxpayer from ending up paying billions of dollars in defaulted deposits. 
   Most of these 22 thrifts were commercial companies that were enticed by the Office of Thrift Supervision--the Federal Home Loan Bank Board--to come in and buy troubled thrifts, to bring good management, and to bring in hard cash. And these commercial companies responded. No one would dispute that the S&L collapse cost tens of billions of dollars less than it would have had these commercial companies not come in and invested their hard-earned money in thrifts. 
   Let me note another thing. You get the idea from this amendment that there is something wrong with unitary thrifts, that there is something wrong with commercial companies owning thrifts. First of all, during the S&L crisis from 1985 to 1992, the default rate of thrifts that ended up going into insolvency--the bankruptcy rate among thrifts that were owned by commercial companies--proportionately speaking, was half the rate of default on thrifts that were not owned by commercial companies. So the plain truth is, today these S&Ls that are owned by commercial interests are among the most stable, most secure S&Ls in America. 
   Let me also note that in terms of the regulatory review currently underway, consistently those thrifts that are least subject to complaints about violating various provisions of Federal law--the thrifts that behave best in complying with the law--are consistently the unitary thrifts, the thrifts that are owned by a commercial interest. 
   There is no evidence, therefore, based on any safety and soundness concern, that unitary thrifts are anything less than safer, sounder, better run and, as a result, more compliant with existing law than other thrifts. In fact, the Office of Thrift Supervision has indicated that out of 1,428 enforcement actions against thrifts from January 1993 to June 1997, only 3 of those enforcement actions involved unitary thrifts. These are the best performers and they are the best in terms of complying with the law. 
   What is the problem here? Under the bill which is pending before the Senate, which passed the Senate Banking Committee, we changed the law so there could be no more unitary thrifts. We have a cutoff date, which is the date the committee markup document was released to the public. As of that day, under our bill no commercial interest can get a new thrift charter. 
   I think it is important to note that when you look at the applications that are pending--and we have a lot of applications pending for thrift ownership--most of them are by insurance companies and securities companies. They would rather own a bank, but until we pass this bill--and I hope we do pass this bill--they cannot do it, so they have applied to own a thrift. If we pass this bill, many of those applications will be withdrawn. But this amendment does not have anything to do with them. 
   Of the proposals for unitary thrifts--that is, commercial companies that are trying to buy a thrift charter or get a thrift charter issued--there are only seven of them. So here is the point. This ability of commercial companies to get a thrift charter is over 20 years old. It has existed for 20 years. Any commercial company--from General Motors to A&P, to Kroger's, to Bell Telephone, to whatever--could apply for a thrift charter. For 20 years they have had that right. Mr. President, 22 have done it, 22 have gotten the charter, and most of them got the charter when they were basically cajoled by the Government to do it, to bring in billions of dollars to try to help us solve the S&L problem. 
   My trusty staff tells me it was 30 years they have had the opportunity--there are 22 of them--not 20 years. 
   Now, with all the talk of ``runaway unitary thrifts,'' only seven applications are pending. So, what does our bill do and what does the Johnson amendment do? Our bill says that--for the 22 commercial interests, most of whom got into the S&L business as part of our effort to stop the collapse of the S&L industry--our bill says, after the date we introduce the bill, any application coming after that date cannot be considered; that the 7 applications which are already pending can be considered; and the 22 which already exist can continue to operate. 
   To that extent, the committee bill and the Johnson amendment are very, very similar. The difference is that the Johnson 
   amendment, in addition, provides that if you own a unitary thrift you can't sell it to any other commercial interest; and if you sell a thrift holding company--which, in virtually every case, has a commercial interest--it has to be broken up upon its sale, because you cannot sell it with any commercial interest as part of it. 
   We have a simple term for this kind of action. It is in the fifth amendment of the Constitution. It is called ``takings.'' This is a constitutional issue. This is not some philosophical position of competition and free enterprise. This is not an issue directly about how we can make the industry better or what might help or harm the consumer. This is about private property. This is a constitutional issue. If we could go back and start this whole thing over again, if we were starting with an absolutely clean slate, I would, in all probability, oppose permitting commercial companies owning thrifts--if we were starting with a fresh slate. 
   But the problem is, we are starting with 22 companies that have already invested billions of dollars, most of them doing so during the S&L crisis when we begged them to do it. They have now built businesses and part of the value of their franchise is based on their ability to be able to sell it. If it has to be broken up when it is sold, as every thrift holding company would have to be, under the Johnson amendment, if it had any commercial interest--and almost all of them do--the net result is, our estimates are, that the passage of this amendment would destroy between 10 and 15 percent of the value of these S&L charters. 
   If our colleague from South Dakota had proposed an amendment that would have taken money out of the insurance fund and assessed what it would cost these owners of thrift charters to limit their ability to sell them to other commercial interests, and to require they be broken up if they were sold, and we were going to compensate them from the insurance fund, I might support such an amendment. But the idea that on an ex post facto basis we are going to come in and destroy the value of charters, that we are going to lower their value estimated between 10 and 15 percent simply because we do not have commercial ownership of banks, is simply unconstitutional. 
   What is going to happen on this? I can tell you what is going to happen: We now have had a series of Supreme Court rulings related to takings. The Supreme Court, thank God, has suddenly awakened to the provision in the fifth amendment which is as important as any provision in the first amendment. In fact, John Locke would have said ``more important.'' The Founding Fathers understood its importance. And that provision says:  
   No private property shall be taken for public purpose except through compensation.  
   How do I know how the Court is going to rule on this? They have already ruled on a similar issue. You remember something called ``supervisory goodwill''? Here is what happened: Congress got a number of businesses to buy troubled thrifts--one of the things we did when we had no money--so the thrift was worth a negative $500 million and they came in, took it over for nothing and assumed its liabilities. 
   So, having no money to protect the depositors, we said, if you will protect the depositor, we will give you $500 million of regulatory goodwill and for a period of time you can hold it as capital. Do you know what happened? Congress decided that was not a good idea. So we passed a bill, called FIRREA,  that took it back. And these thrifts went to court and argued: We made investments under a certain set of rules, Congress on an ex post facto basis came back and repealed those rules. 
   They took our property. There was a taking. Congress took billions of dollars from us and, in fact, the Federal Claims Court on April 9 of this year ruled that the Federal Government owes Glendale Federal Bank $990 million in damages for this taking. I remind my colleagues, there is a list of S&Ls which takes up half a page that has exactly the same claim against the Federal Government. 
   Whether you like the idea of a commercial company owning a thrift--and, I remind you, they have a better record of safety and soundness, they have a better record of performance, they have a better record of complying with the laws and regulations than thrifts as a whole--but even if you don't like it, do you think we have a right to steal their property? Even if you don't like them, do you think Congress has a right now to change the rules and say, ``Oh, yes, you can hold your charter, but if you ever sell it, it will have to be broken up because it has a commercial interest as part of it''? 
   It is estimated that this amendment, the moment it becomes law, would destroy 10 to 20 percent of the stock value of these companies through a taking. 
   If we adopt the Johnson amendment, these companies are going to file a lawsuit against the Federal Government. 
   I believe, based on the rulings that have occurred on regulatory goodwill, that they are going to win these lawsuits, and then where are these billions of dollars coming from? Are they going to come out of the insurance fund? Are they going to come from the taxpayers? Maybe we should have a second-degree amendment that says if this is a taking, we will raise the insurance assessment to raise the money to pay for the taking rather than having it foisted onto the Treasury. I don't know if our colleague from South Dakota would vote for such an amendment, but it seems to me a pretty reasonable amendment. 
   If we did not have unitary thrifts, I doubt we would create them. I am not ready yet to have commercial companies own banks. I have no doubt in 20 years they will, but we are not ready yet. If we didn't have unitary thrifts, we would not create them. 
   To sum up, here are the critical points: We did not create unitary thrifts by accident. There is no loophole. The 1967 bill was extensively debated; there were hearings and the bill was adopted overwhelmingly on a bipartisan vote to bring in new capital and new management that was desperately needed. 
   Thirty-two years later, we are coming in and saying, ``Boy, you have given us those tens of billions of dollars and we really appreciate it, but we're not going to live up to our end of the bargain.'' We are going to say, ``Yes, we took your money and it saved us tens of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, but now we don't like you anymore, and so if you ever sell your thrift, you are on notice right now your thrift holding company will have to be broken up.'' 
   Unitary thrifts might have become a big problem if we were not considering this financial modernization bill. But if we pass this bill, all but 22 S&Ls that are owned by commercial interests will be owned by insurance companies or securities firms. So this is a problem that some people imagined existed before this bill, but we are talking only about 22 companies and 7 pending applications. 
   I have received calls from many banks that say they want this amendment passed. But when I explain to them that it might sound like a great idea, until you realize you are taking somebody's property and violating the Constitution, I have found people understand that. The fact that we have lobbyists calling up telling us to do this does not mean we have to do it. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. I preserve my ability to offer a constitutional point of order if the motion to table fails. I reserve the right to offer a second-degree amendment which would require the insurance rates to be raised to pay for any takings, but I hope those will not be necessary. 
   This is not a good amendment. I know there are a lot of interests for it, but it is not a good amendment. I urge my colleagues to take the long view on this and not vote for it so we are not back here in 2 years trying to come up with billions of dollars to pay off these lawsuits.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as a courtesy to Senator JOHNSON, let me conclude my remarks, and then let him give the concluding remarks on the amendment. 
   First of all, we have had several references to the Asian crisis. I want to remind my colleagues that the Asian crisis was banking and government, not banking and commerce. 
   The second point is that Ford Motors, for example, at the strong urging of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, put a billion dollars into Nationwide in the 1980s, and that billion dollars reduced the amount the taxpayer had to pay to guarantee those deposits by a billion dollars. 
   Here is the point. Nobody makes you go into some industry where your tax laws might be changed ex post facto. I am not for ex post facto laws, but we have passed them from time to time. But in this case, these thrifts were requested, asked, begged to make investments in the S&L industry for the benefit of the taxpayer and the insurance fund. I just want to read a couple of lines from some letters. 
   This is from the National Retail Federation:  
   Seventy-nine failing thrifts were purchased and infused with $3 billion of new capital. Had these institutions undergone liquidation at taxpayers' expense, the cost would have been billions more. Capital from our industries looked pretty good at the time. We don't see what has changed.  
   They put up $3 billion to go into industries that let them be in retailing and in the S&L business, and now we are going to say to them, if you sell your holding company, you are going to have to tear up your business, drive down its value by 10 or 15 percent. They don't understand how we changed the rules of the game when they were asked to get into the business. 
   The National Association of Manufacturers wrote:  
   Unitary thrifts were established in 1967 to attract private capital into the thrift industry during the thrift crisis. The National Association of Manufacturers' members responded, saving the taxpayer billions of dollars. Putative grandfathering of existing unitary thrifts serves only to eliminate competition and innovation.  
   I could read from the Home Builders, and others, but the bottom line is this: These companies have a case that they were urged to invest this money by the Government based on a set of rules. If we now come in and change the value of their companies on the equity market instantaneously by 10 or 20 percent, I believe there has been a taking, and I think most people would believe there has been a taking. As we all know, the Supreme Court has been increasingly willing in cases such as Lucas v. South Carolina and Dolan v. City to rule on takings, and to force the Federal Government to pay for it. 
   So if this amendment is adopted, I believe it would probably be prudent to have a second-degree amendment, which I hope would be agreed to, which would simply say that if there are court rulings that there has been a takings, we should raise the fees for the insurance fund to pay those costs, rather than letting those costs fall on the taxpayer. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, our current blueprint is that we are going to vote on the unitary thrift amendment at 3:45. Each side will have 3 minutes to speak on that issue. I will ask Senator GORTON to speak on behalf of the majority. 
   At the conclusion of that vote, the Shelby amendment will be considered. That is the amendment which would allow banks to provide broad financial services within the structure of the bank rather than through the holding company. We have agreed to a 2-hour debate on that amendment. If we were on that amendment, say, at 10 after 4, we would be through with that amendment at 10 after 6. 
   I do not know of another major amendment. I urge my colleagues who have amendments, since we have a lot of Members hoping not to be here tomorrow--Members walking by do not object to that, I assume--who would like to catch a flight back to their States at a reasonable hour, if they could, not to convenience me or to convenience my colleague, Senator SARBANES, but to convenience all 100 Members of the Senate, I urge Senators who have amendments to come to the floor and present them. Please don't show up at 6:10 and say, oh, by the way, I just had an idea last night while I was having dessert that I would like to redo the whole banking system of the United States of America and I would like to change the number of people on the Federal Reserve Bank board and I talked to the newspaperman today and he thought it was a great idea. 
   If you have an amendment, I hope you will come and let us look at it and talk about it. Hopefully, we can take some of these amendments and save time. I urge my colleagues, for the convenience of all of our Members, if you have amendments, to come down here before 4 and let us talk about them. 
   Please don't show up when the Shelby amendment is finished at 6:10 and say I have all these ideas and I want to deal with them. 
   I thank my colleagues in advance for their cooperation. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think if anyone knows me and knows RICHARD SHELBY, they know that we came to Congress on the same day. We served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee together. We were both Democrats then. We both changed parties. We both ran for the Senate. And RICHARD and I have been very close friends since the first day we came. I think you always regret when you have these kinds of tough battles, but this is a tough battle. This is vitally important. 
   Let me basically outline what I want to say and then let me go about trying to say it. 
   First of all, there has been some speculation about whether or not, as chairman of the Banking Committee and a new chairman, chairman only for a few months, whether or not I would pull my own bill, which, as the Presiding Officer knows as a member of the committee, has been a great labor of mine for all these many months and has been the labor of Congress for 25 years. As to whether I would pull the bill over this issue, let me leave no suspense: I will pull this bill if the Shelby amendment is adopted. 
   You might think that is a very strong statement to make, but I think when you hear my presentation, you will understand why I make it, because with all the good things in the bill, I want people to understand that all of them combined together would not undo the harm that would be done by this amendment. 
   What I will do is answer Senator SHELBY on foreign banks. I will then go through and talk about the real issue: What is the issue for Democrats who are hearing from the Secretary of the Treasury? What is the issue for Republicans who are hearing from big banks? What is the public interest? 
   I will try to answer those issues. Let me begin with the foreign banks. 
   Senator SHELBY would have us believe that we need to start subsidizing American banks because foreign banks are subsidized. He would have us believe that somehow we have given foreign banks a different set of regulations to abide by in America than American banks have had and that therefore we need to do something about it. 
   Let me address that. And I want to address it first by reading Alan Greenspan's thoughtful letter. Interestingly enough, Senator SHELBY referred to part of it. But I think it goes right to the heart of the issue. 
   Reading his letter of May 4:  
   First, the Board did not simply choose to let foreign banks operate in this country through subsidiaries. The law required it. The International Banking Act......  
   That was passed in 1978--  
   ......provides that a foreign bank shall be treated as a.......holding company for purposes of nonbanking acquisitions.  
   That is the law of the land. That was adopted by Congress. That was signed by the President. The Chairman of the Board of the Federal Reserve had nothing to do with that. He simply had the responsibility of implementing it.  
   Therefore, when the Board allowed U.S. bank holding companies to own securities companies, the Board was required to permit foreign banks that met the statutory conditions also to acquire such companies. 
   The law treating foreign banks as holding companies was a practical response to an existing situation: most foreign banks do not have holding companies.   
   And I will get to that point in a minute because it is important.  
   Without the [International Banking Act's] approach, foreign banks generally would be excluded from the U.S. market, in violation of the national treatment principles embedded in U.S. law....... 
   The Board stated it would monitor, and in fact has monitored, this situation to assure that foreign banks do not in fact operate to the detriment of U.S. banking organizations....... 
   A recent Federal Reserve study of the performance of section 20 companies over the last eight years demonstrates that foreign bank-owned section 20 companies have substantially underperformed U.S.-owned section 20 companies....... 
   To cite the fact of foreign bank structure to support a similar structure in the United States is not only misleading, it is potentially harmful.  
   Let me explain what all that means in English. What it means is, we passed a law, and the law said that since foreign banks do not use holding companies--they use operating subsidiaries because it is permitted under their law--that for treatment purposes, they would be treated as holding companies in the United States. Senator SHELBY says this is unfair. 
   I would like to note that the Federal Reserve, noting a potential problem with it, set out a monitoring process to see if these foreign banks are benefiting relative to our banks in promoting unfair competition. 
   What the Fed found in 1995 was that not only were they not benefiting, but they lost 11 percent. In 1996, their rate of return was minus 8 percent. In 1997, their rate of return was 18 percent. And in 1998, their rate of return was 25 percent. 
   So the plain truth is, these foreign banks are poorly run, their subsidiary operations are a disaster, but if they were well run, and if they were getting a competitive advantage, we would do something about it. The point is, it has not created a problem. 
   Nineteen of these foreign banks are in the securities business. Together, they make up less than 2.6 percent of the American market. In terms of underwriting revenues, they earn 3.8 percent of the revenues. So the point is, these foreign banks are not effective in competing against American banks. The point is, 
   because foreign governments subsidize their banks, do we want to subsidize our banks? As chairman of the Banking Committee, I can tell you, if these foreign subsidies started having an unfair effect in our market, we would take action to change the law and prevent this advantage. 
   But we have allowed this situation to exist for two reasons: One, it has not done us any harm, and, two, we sell $10 of financial services abroad for every $1 of financial services sold in America. So the last thing we wanted to do is get into a trade war in banking, because we are the world's greatest bankers, we are the world's greatest exporters of banking services. And so it was to our advantage to allow this to happen as long as it was doing no harm. 
   What is the real issue at stake in this amendment? I want to begin with a quote from Secretary Rubin. In fact, many people on the Democrat side of the aisle have been called by Secretary Rubin in the last few days. Some people on our side of the aisle have been called. I want to read you a quote from Secretary Rubin. And then I want to pose a question: What could this quote possibly be referring to? 
   This is a quote from the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, on May 5, 1999, before the Finance Subcommittee of the House Commerce Committee. And I will read you the quote:  
   [O]ne of an elected Administration's critical responsibilities is the formation of economic policy, and an important component of that policy is banking policy. In order for the elected Administration to have an effective role in banking policy, it must have a strong connection with the banking system.  
   I remind my colleagues that the Comptroller of the Currency, who works for Robert Rubin, regulates national banks. And national banks make up 58 percent of the assets in American banks. Why isn't that ``an effective role in banking policy''? Why is it not ``a strong connection with the banking system''? I can tell you, Secretary Rubin is right: It is not a strong connection. The Comptroller of the Currency is an accountant. Banking policy is run by the Federal Reserve. And I thank God for that every single day. 
   I thank God every single day that in 1913, after the Treasury had run monetary policy in this country--we had a giant panic in 1907; the country had gone through continuing economic convulsions--the Congress put an end to it by setting up an independent monetary authority called the Federal Reserve. 
   The Federal Reserve, with an independent board--appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate for very long terms--exercises independent monetary policy. So when the President wants to inflate the economy to get reelected, the Fed says no. When Congress feels we need to print more money to get things moving to help them in their elections, the Fed says no. We have an independent monetary authority. 
   So while the Comptroller of the Currency is an accountant that primarily audits national banks, he has no policy authority at all. Why? Because the Federal Reserve regulates the holding companies, and there are 6,867 holding companies in America that together make up about 96 percent of bank assets. 
   So sure enough, the Treasury sends out all of the accountants and auditors, but the Federal Reserve sets the policy. And what Robert Rubin is saying, in the clearest possible terms, is he wants to set banking policy, he wants to set monetary policy. That is exactly what he is saying. 
   The question is, Do we want to put the Treasury back in the position of setting banking policy in America? Do we want the President to have the ability to use banking policy as a political tool? 
   Are we not talking about repealing the Federal Reserve Act? 
   Now, how all this comes about is a little complicated, but with a teeny bit of detective work, it becomes very, very clear. 
   Remember, the Fed does not regulate banks. Not a single bank in America is regulated directly by the Fed. But it regulates holding companies that control banks, and those holding companies have 97 percent of the assets of banks. Why do they have it? Because our law requires that banks not provide other financial services within the bank, for safety and soundness reasons, and so big banks and banks that have large assets are holding companies and they come under the Federal Reserve. 
   Now, if we adopted the Shelby amendment, let me read what Alan Greenspan and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve say would happen:  
   As I have testified, if profit is their goal, there is no choice. Because of the subsidy implicit in the Federal safety net, profit-maximizing management will invariably choose the operating subsidiary. As a consequence, the holding company structure will atrophy in favor of bank operating subsidiaries. Our [and ``our'' being the Federal Reserve] current ability rests principally on our role as holding company supervisor.  
   So here is the point: If you let banks perform these services within the bank itself, their securities affiliate or, in the future, their insurance affiliate or any other thing you allow them to do can get the advantage of the bank's FDIC insurance and the ability to borrow money from the Fed, which is the lowest interest rate in the world, and if they can use the Fed wire, the Fed has estimated that doing these things within the bank creates about a 14 basis points advantage over doing them outside the bank. Those little margins make a very big difference. 
   So, obviously, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve believe and both agree that if you let banks perform these functions inside the bank, banks will tend to close down their holding companies and bring these functions inside the bank. 
   Now, I am going to talk about that issue separately. But what does that mean in terms of monetary policy? It means that the Comptroller of the Currency, who will be regulating banks that will no longer be holding companies, will become the banking authority in the country, and the Federal Reserve will see the number of holding companies it regulates decline, decline, decline, and decline. 
   Now, interestingly, the Treasury and the Shelby amendment, one and the same, recognize this. They say, OK, for the 43 largest holding companies, we will force them to maintain their holding company, so that the Fed will continue to regulate them. That means that 6,824 other holding companies will be allowed to change their structure. They will be driven by the profit motive to do it. Therefore, over time the  control of banking policy and ultimately monetary policy--because bank regulation is a source of strength for the Fed in implementing much of its policy--will shift from the Federal Reserve to the Treasury, from an independent agency to an arm of the President of the United States. 
   Now, you might say, well, the Federal Reserve still regulates 43 holding companies. But the holding companies have every incentive to conduct all of their activities within the bank, so the holding companies, the 43 left that the Fed would regulate, will be empty shells. 
   The Fed's power comes from the power to regulate banks. Their ability to get banks together to prevent a financial collapse--such as the Long Term Capital Management case in New York--was their ability, using moral suasion by the fact that they regulated the holding companies that were involved, to get people together and basically nudge them, encourage them, and, if you like, pressure them into dealing with that crisis before it got moving. 
   Now, I ask my colleagues on the first point: Do you want this administration, or any administration, to control banking policy? 
   The Secretary of the Treasury says they should; it is part of the tools they say they need to conduct economic policy. 
   Let me tell you something, Mr. President. We had this debate in 1913. We decided we didn't want the President, in 1913, controlling banking policy. We have decided we do not want any President or did not want any President since that time. 
   Would we have been better off in the last 2 years of the Reagan administration if the Treasury had controlled banking policy instead of the Federal Reserve? I do not think so. When the Bush administration was in a reelection campaign and losing the election because the economy was recovering slowly, would we have wanted the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency--appointed by the President, removable by the President--would we have wanted them to have the ability to turn on the printing presses or to use expansionary policy with the banks? I do not think we would. 
   Do we want this President to have the ability to control banking policy when he orders the Comptroller of the Currency, who would be the new central banking regulatory authority under the Shelby amendment, to come to the White House for a fundraiser with bankers? 
   This is not a partisan matter. Bill Clinton is going to be President for 18 more months. We may well then have a Republican President. I hope so. But I do not want a Republican or Democratic President to control banking policy. We set up an independent Fed to do that, and I want them to do it. Have no doubt about it, when Robert Rubin is saying that this amendment is a way of expanding the administration's effective role in banking policy, he means transferring from the Fed to the Treasury the ability to set banking policy. 
   Now, if you are for that, if you believe the executive branch of American government ought to set banking policy, you should vote for the Shelby amendment. But if you believe we have done pretty well under Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve, if you believe that since 1913 the American economy has performed pretty well by taking banking policy away from Congress and away from the executive branch of government and putting it in an independent agency, if you believe that, do not vote for this amendment. This amendment is clearly an effort to transfer regulatory authority over banking from the Federal Reserve to the Treasury. That would be a disaster for America. That would be far more important in its negative impact than anything we could possibly do in terms of letting banks get into a few other areas of providing services. 
   This is a fundamental issue. I urge my colleagues not to get caught up on the Democrat side of the aisle with the fact that there is a Democrat President or that we have a very friendly, nice, and competent Secretary of the Treasury who is calling them up and saying, ``We need you to vote with us.'' This is not a partisan matter. An independent control of banking policy in America, an independent agency controlling banking policy, is not a partisan matter, it is a matter that this Congress, on a bipartisan basis, has stood for since 1913. 
   I don't want to take any step, and I don't believe America, if it understood this issue, would want to take a step backward from that. 
   Let me talk to my Republican colleagues. We have written a bill, and I think it is a good bill. I had a lot to do with writing it, so obviously I think that. But I think other people are beginning to think it, too. This is a big bank, big securities, big insurance bill. That is just a reality. And I have to say that there is something a little bit obscene about big banks calling up Members of the Senate and saying: ``Well, you know we only got 95 percent of what we wanted in that bill. We could get another 15 percent and go up to 110 percent if you could let us provide these services within the bank, rather than doing it outside the bank.'' 
   Now, the banks are not caught up in who is going to conduct banking policy. They are caught up in the fact that they are going to make more money if they can provide these services inside the bank, because they get the subsidies from the FDIC insurance, the Fed window and the Fed wire. 
   I don't so much complain about them taking this sort of narrow self-interested view as I complain about our responding to it, let me say. We have all heard: What is good for General Motors is good for America. That is not right. What is good for America is good for General Motors. I just say to my colleagues, whatever commitments you have made on this, whatever partisanship you feel on this, ask yourself a question: Is it good for America to give the Treasury--an agency controlled by the President--control over banking policy in this country and take that control, at least partially, away from the Federal Reserve? 
   Do we want monetary policy to continue to be based on an objective set out to maintain stable prices and economic growth, or do we want to bring politics into it? Obviously, Secretary Rubin wants the administration to conduct banking policy, and that is why he asked for this amendment. He says it in clear English. I don't want this administration to conduct banking policy, but at least you have to say I am a little broad-minded. I don't want any administration to conduct monetary policy. 
   To try to summarize, because it gets complicated: The Secretary of the Treasury wants this amendment adopted because banks, by providing these new services inside the bank, will find it cheaper to do that, more profitable, and they will fold their holding companies, which they only set up because the law required them for safety and soundness to undertake these riskier activities outside the bank. As they fold up these holding companies, the Federal Reserve loses regulatory control over them and the Comptroller of the Currency, and therefore the President, gains regulatory control over them. So what Secretary Rubin is talking about is basically giving the Treasury regulatory authority that the Federal Reserve now has. 
   Nothing in our bill takes power away from the Treasury. A lot of people have gotten confused that this is just a power struggle, where this bill would give the Federal Reserve more authority, and the Treasury wants to share it, or the Treasury wants more. Look, the Fed regulates bank holding companies. Virtually all the wealth is already in bank holding companies. The Comptroller audits national banks. There is no shift in the regulatory authority in our underlying bill. 
   But the amendment that Senator SHELBY has offered with Senator DASCHLE, supported by the Clinton administration, is the biggest regulatory shift, the biggest power grab, by a Federal bureaucracy that I have seen in my 20 years in Congress. And it is absolutely critical that we slam the door on this power grab, not because Rubin is a bad guy and Greenspan is a good guy, but because Rubin is a political appointee controlled by a President who, by the very nature of the Presidency--whether it is President Ronald Reagan or President William Clinton--he has political concerns to deal 
   with, as he should. 
   We decided in 1913 to take banking policy out of the hands of politicians and put it into the Federal Reserve. We dare not take action to take it back.  Maybe Robert Rubin would do a good job with it. Maybe Bill Clinton might fire Rubin and appoint somebody else, or maybe Rubin might leave. But the point is, the Fed, whoever is there--and I hope Alan Greenspan will be there forever--will be independent, with a long term, and will be independent of the President, and so will the board members who share that power. 
   If this issue doesn't move you, then I have done a poor job, because I have been standing on the floor for 3 days and I am tired. If this issue doesn't move you, it is not because the issue is not moving; it is because I am not moving. I want to urge my colleagues to think long and hard before we take an action that, in reality, is a step toward repealing the essence of the Federal Reserve Act. 
   Let me turn to the other side of the story. It is an important story. I have explained first how this amendment is a step toward repealing the Federal Reserve Act by giving the control of bank regulation to the Treasury instead of the Federal Reserve. But let me explain that, for safety and soundness, for the well-being of the taxpayer, and for competition, this amendment is also a bad thing. Banks receive a subsidy from the Government because they have their principal asset--deposits--insured by the FDIC. They have deposit insurance. No other nonbanking institution has that guarantee. Your insurance salesman doesn't have it. Your securities broker doesn't have it. The stock exchange doesn't have it. The bank has it. 
   The bank also has the ability to go to the Federal Reserve and borrow at the lowest interest rates in the country. And they have the ability to use the Fed wire to transfer money that is guaranteed. What all that means is that if you let banks provide broad-based financial services, which this bill does--but it requires them to do it outside the bank--if you let them do it inside the bank, these huge banks with massive capital, when they are selling securities or underwriting them--or, ultimately, because if you let them do securities today, in 5 or 10 years, you are going to let them do insurance within the bank, and we all know it--these banks will have an enormous and unfair competitive advantage due entirely to the Federal subsidies they are receiving. 
   When they are selling securities, or selling insurance or underwriting it, they are going to have a competitive advantage because they can borrow money more cheaply than an insurance company or an independent stockbroker. So what is going to happen over time is, with that competitive advantage, they are going to end up dominating the securities industry, and in the long run, dominating the insurance industry. 
   I ask you the question: Do we want a banking industry that dominates the entire financial services industry? I helped write this bill to promote more competition. I did not write this bill so that 20 years from now we look like Japan, with 10 banks dominating the entire financial services area. I know about the Presiding Officer, but I don't know about other people. I happen to love my independent insurance agents and they love me, and I appreciate it. I happen to love my little independent stockbroker in my hometown; he was my campaign manager the first time I ever ran for Congress. I don't want to force these people out of business by giving an unfair competitive advantage to banks. 
   We are not talking about foreign banks who don't know how to do it, even with a Government subsidy; we are talking about American banks that know how to do it. 
   Now, Mr. President, the next problem is that we are going to create an unlevel playing field, and banks are going to dominate these industries not because they are better, but because their structure of being able to provide these services within banks is one that is cheaper to operate in. 
   The third and final problem is selling insurance--underwriting insurance--which ultimately will happen if we go this direction with op-subs on securities--selling securities; underwriting securities is risky business. 
   What we are doing, if we put that power within the structure of the bank, is that taxpayers are underwriting it, at least implicitly with Federal deposit insurance. So we are putting the taxpayer on the hook. 
   The alternative in the bill is, except for very small banks that can't afford to have holding companies, to require banks that have holding companies--and they are large enough to have them, they can provide all these new services--but they have to do them outside the banks. So the taxpayer is not on the hook for the deposit insurance for these activities, and the banks don't get a subsidy to conduct these activities due to the fact that capital is cheaper inside the bank, and we don't create a structure where the Treasury--a political institution--exercises more banking regulation and the Fed less. 
   Alan Greenspan, testifying before the House Commerce Committee last week, made a very strong statement. Those of you who know Alan Greenspan know that he is not prone to get to the point. In fact, we have reporters in this town who have become very successful by figuring out what Alan Greenspan is saying. He will go around the barn and the outhouse, and all over the barnyard, before he finally gets to the point. And, if he is saying something that he knows somebody isn't going to like, he is even more roundabout so as not to hurt anyone's feelings. Quite frankly, he does it perfectly. Every central banker in the world models himself after Alan Greenspan, who is the greatest central banker probably in the history of the world. 
   But he wasn't beating around the bush when he talked to the House Commerce Committee. He said, ``I and my colleagues''--he means members of the Federal Reserve Board--``are firmly of the view that the long-term stability of U.S. financial markets and the interests of the American taxpayer would be better served by no financial modernization bill rather than one that allows the proposed new activities to be conducted by the bank.......'' 
   This is not just an average kind of Joe talking. 
   It is interesting to me that we talk to a few bankers on the telephone, and all of a sudden we think we know as much about banking policy as Alan Greenspan. This is the most successful central banker in history who is saying that when you look at the three problems with this approach, one, you put the taxpayer on the hook in a risky business that ought not to be inside the bank; that, two, you create an unfair playing surface that will create unfair competition and hurt the economy, and make the economy more vulnerable; and, finally, you transfer control of bank regulations from an independent agency--the Fed--to the Treasury and, therefore, to the President. 
   Based on those three things, Alan Greenspan--who is a strong supporter of this bill; he is for this bill; at the end of the last Congress, he spent numerous hours trying to get it passed, and he is for it now--says, if you adopt this amendment then the country would be better off with no bill at all. 
   My colleagues, it has been a long 3 days of debating. I never challenge anybody's sincerity. But I want to urge my colleagues, my Democrat colleagues who are getting all this pressure now, you know--Republicans have won on many of these issues, this is an opportunity for Democrats to win; the Secretary of the Treasury has said that the President will veto the bill if you do not give the Treasury control over banking policy. And I know that my Democrat colleagues are under a lot of pressure. 
   But I want to urge my colleagues to look at what we are doing here in terms of moving away from an independent banking authority toward putting the control of banking policy under the President. It is a very, very dangerous thing to do. 
   I urge my colleagues to resist the pressure and vote against this. Ordinarily two-thirds of the Democrat Members of Congress would oppose this amendment. But what is happening here, in part because the issue has become so partisan--and I am partly to blame for this--but what is happening is we have a dynamic where an amendment that should not be even seriously considered is going to have a very, very close vote, and could very well pass. 
   I just urge my colleagues, if you are not swayed by risk to the taxpayer, if you are not swayed by unfair competition and concentration of industry--and many of my Democrat colleagues are swayed by those things in most of the issues--if you are not swayed by  that, be swayed by Secretary Rubin who thinks the administration ought to control banking policy. We decided in 1913 not to let him do it. Do we want to go back and change that decision today? I don't think so. 
   I want to conclude by saying to my Republican colleagues--I know Senator SHELBY is very persuasive. That is one of the reasons that I love him and that we are very good friends. I know a lot of people have been torn with me grabbing them and screaming in one ear, and Senator SHELBY grabbing them and screaming in their other ear. I know they are ready for this thing to be over. But this is not a parochial issue, or a personal issue, or a regional issue. 
   When we are talking about reversing a policy established in 1913 for independent banking authority because the Secretary of the Treasury wants the President to conduct banking policy, something we rejected in 1913, this goes way beyond hearing from your bank back home that says, ``Gee, I would rather do it this way. I appreciate the bill. You have done it. It is going to help me. But you could help me more by letting me do it this way.'' I think we have to resist that siren song. 
   I don't want to sound too preachy, so let me just stop and urge my colleagues to give some long and prayerful deliberation on this amendment, because I think it is very important. I know it is a hard vote. I wish it weren't so hard. 
   But I think it is a very clear vote. I think if you stand back and look at it, it is hard to think of a vote we have cast around here that was much clearer in terms of what is the national interest. It can't be good for your bank back home if it is bad for America. I think that is the key issue I would like people to remember. 
   Mr. President, can you tell me how much time I have left, and how much time Senator SHELBY has?

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I guess the best place to conclude is to quote the principals in this debate. Secretary Rubin before the House Commerce Committee said:  
   [O]ne of an elected Administration's critical responsibilities is the formation of economic policy, and an important component of that policy is banking policy. In order for the elected Administration to have an effective role in banking policy, it must have a strong connection with the banking system.  
   What is being said here is that the Secretary of the Treasury believes that the President should exercise more control over the banking system. Now, if you believe the time has come to turn back the clock to 1913 and take banking policy away from the independent Federal Reserve, you agree with Secretary Rubin. I do not agree with Secretary Rubin. The fact that I do not agree has nothing to do with the fact that he is a Democrat and Bill Clinton is President. I do not believe any President should have control of banking policy. We decided in 1913 to put it in an independent agency, and that should not change. 
   All of you know that Alan Greenspan is not prone to overstatement--quite  the contrary--but Alan Greenspan has said that he and every member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, most of them appointed by President Clinton, are firmly of the view that the long-term stability of U.S. financial markets and the interests of the American taxpayer would be better served by no financial modernization bill rather than adopting this amendment. 
   Now, that is as clear as you can make this debate. It is partly about risk. It is riskier to be in the securities business inside a bank than it is outside the bank, when the taxpayer guarantees the bank depositors. That is part of the reason to vote no on the Shelby amendment. You do get a subsidy for a bank when they are doing activities inside the bank, instead of having to take capital out and investing it like everybody else. 
   And if you are worried about a level playing surface, that is a reason to vote against the SHELBY amendment. But finally, if you believe that the Federal Reserve ought to conduct banking policy, and not the Treasury, that is the strongest reason to vote against the Shelby amendment. 
   Finally, two points: No. 1, if my colleagues will vote to table the Shelby amendment, we will work in conference to preserve the primacy of the Fed to deal with problems of unfair competition and subsidy, and yet try to find a way to let banks choose between operating subsidiaries and affiliates, to do these activities inside the bank or out. 
   Secondly, as hard as I have worked on this, and as strongly as I feel about it, given Alan Greenspan's position and given that I believe he is right, we are not going to pass this bill tonight if we adopt the Shelby amendment. So I urge my colleagues, if you want this bill, if you want an independent banking policy, give me an opportunity in conference to sit the Secretary of the Treasury down and sit the head of the Federal Reserve down and give us a chance to come up with ways to do op-subs without letting the Treasury take over banking policy. 
   We can do that by simply not changing the regulator based on whether you have a holding company or not, or what the holding company does. And we can find ways to require banks to have good capital and to see that the subsidy doesn't exist. But to do that, we need to defeat this amendment and pass this bill. 
   I know my colleagues are tired of being cajoled. They think a lot of overstatements have been made. I simply would like to say, from my part, I believe this is a critical vote. If you think passing the Federal Reserve Act was a good thing, if you think we prospered under an independent banking authority--and I do--then you want to vote ``no'' on this amendment. 
   That doesn't mean that we can't later come up with a way of trying to do this that works, and I pledge to my colleagues my best effort in conference to do that. But we can't do that if we can't pass this bill. And we can't pass this amendment and pass this bill. So that is where we are. I know people have commitments out everywhere, and they are going to make somebody mad no matter what they do. But there is an old adage my grandmother used to say: ``If you are going to catch hell no matter what you do, do the right thing.'' That is what I ask my colleagues to do--the right thing.

   I commend Senator JEFFORDS for bringing to our attention housing conditions which are national in scope and affect rural and urban areas alike. It is very important that we protect our nation's vulnerable populations, particularly the elderly and disabled living on fixed incomes. It is also extremely important that we preserve the American taxpayer's existing investment in affordable housing. Congress must seek to preserve our existing housing stock and protect current residents first.

   Yesterday, the President came out with six conditions for signing the bill, two of which your substitute does not comply with. Obviously, we are going to have to work with the White House on a continuing basis. 
   I want to assure you, Mr. Leader, I will also sit down, roll up my sleeves, and try to work. Maybe we can't solve these problems, but if it is possible to solve them, I want to do it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin by noting that not one single organization which represents anyone who makes a living in any industry directly affected by this bill supports the Sarbanes substitute. The Sarbanes substitute is opposed by insurance companies, by those who represent the companies; it is opposed by the American Bankers Association, by the Bankers Roundtable, and by the Independent Bankers of America. It is opposed by every organization that represents any facet of the securities industry. This substitute is literally a substitute which has no support by anyone who is going to be directly affected by these laws. 
   What are the major problems with it? There are more problems than I can possibly outline in 6 minutes, so let me just take a couple of them. We all know Alan Greenspan. We know he is the most respected person in America on economic matters. We all know if there is anybody on this planet who can lay any legitimate claim to the current level of prosperity in America, it is Alan Greenspan, because of his banking and monetary policies. 
   We also know that Alan Greenspan is not someone who goes out looking for a fight. If he has to say something that anybody does not want to hear, he tends to go all around the barn before he says it. You need to know those things to understand how strongly Chairman Greenspan feels in his opposition to the Sarbanes substitute. In fact, he has said, ``I and my colleagues''--and by ``colleagues'' he means every member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, most of whom were appointed by Bill Clinton--``are firmly of the view that the long-term stability of the U.S. financial markets and the interests of the American taxpayer would be better served by no financial modernization bill rather than one that allows the proposed new activities to be conducted by the bank......'' 
   Alan Greenspan says in the strongest way possible, in the most passionate terms that he has ever spoken on any issue in his public life: You would be better not to pass a bill than to pass the Sarbanes substitute. 
   Why? Because the Sarbanes substitute lets banks engage in these expanded financial services within the bank, thereby putting at risk the taxpayer through FDIC insurance. By performing these services in banks, they get an implicit subsidy from FDIC insurance, from the discount window, from the Federal wire, that will make banks able--not because they are more efficient, but because of this subsidy--ultimately able to dominate the securities industry and all other industries which would be affected. We would end up with a banking system that looks very much like the Japanese banking system, totally dominating our financial markets. Alan Greenspan is opposed to that. It is very dangerous for the American economy. It is dangerous for the taxpayer. I urge my colleagues to reject this substitute. 
   A second issue I want to talk about is CRA. The current bill preserves CRA. The current bill makes two modest changes. One, it says that if a bank has a long-term history of compliance --has been in compliance three years in a row and is currently in compliance--that if a protest group or individual wants to inject themselves into the process, they can do it. They can say whatever they want to say. But the regulator can't hold up the bank's action in the name of CRA, given their long history of compliance and given that they are currently in compliance, unless the protester has more than a scintilla of evidence; unless the protester can present such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the claim; unless the protester has real, material--not seeming or imaginary--evidence. In other words, if you are going to stop a bank from doing something that it has been found qualified to do, you have to present some evidence--hardly, a demanding constraint. 
   Second, we exempt very small rural banks from CRA. Why? We exempt very small rural banks from CRA for a very simple reason:

   Mr. GRAMM. I have my trusty calculator, and I will make the calculation again. But lest my colleague be correct, let me just restate it in his terms. The term is, does it make sense to make little banks spend $1.3 billion to comply with keeping paperwork when in 9 years, only three banks out of 16,000 audits have been substantially out of compliance? Is that not overkill? Is that not bankrupting every small bank in America? The answer is yes.

   Mr. GRAMM. I know the Senator, and I know he would not want to state something that is incorrect. I will be brief. 
   The amendment says if a bank has a long history of compliance, they have been in compliance for 3 years in a row, they are currently in compliance, in order for the regulator to prevent them from taking the action that they are allowed to take by being in compliance, that a person who protests has to present some substantial evidence. 
   ``Substantial evidence'' is defined in the law as more than a scintilla. It does not in any way say they are deemed to be in compliance, other than that they are innocent until proven guilty if they have a good record. Anybody can protest, anybody can file a complaint, but the regulator can't stop the process or delay it unless the challenging party presents some ``substantial evidence.'' 
   This isn't for everybody. It is only for the banks that have a long history of compliance. 
   I didn't want to have any confusion. That is exactly what it says. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. GRAMM. So let me explain what he would do with his amendment, then explain what he would undo, and then explain why both what he would do and what he would undo is bad. 
   First of all, let me begin with current law in CRA, then what I am going to do is go through what the Senator's amendment would do. I am then going to talk about the history of CRA and within that history I am going to try to explain the problems that we are trying to fix in the underlying bill. Then I want to talk at some length about those problems and about the underlying bill. I think I will have covered the whole waterfront. 
   Let me remind our colleagues the current Community Reinvestment Act basically has two provisions. The first provision is that bank regulators have to consider how a bank has been meeting local credit needs only when a bank applies to open a new bank, branch or to merge. Second, bank regulators may deny application based on a CRA record. So basically, in terms of the existing CRA law, the way it was written, there is no violation for simply failing to comply. The enforcement mechanism is that if you apply to open a new branch or open a bank or to merge, then the bank regulator--whichever one you are subject to, based on your charter--looks to see if you are meeting the needs of your community. And community reinvestment, I would like to remind our colleagues, is focused on lending. The primary focus of community reinvestment is lending in the communities where you take deposits. 
   A bank regulator can deny an application based on your CRA record. There is no penalty involved other than the denial of the 
   application. That is current law in CRA. What the substitute that has been offered by Senator BRYAN would do--I have ``The Sarbanes Substitute,'' because Senator SARBANES offered this in committee and we assumed he would offer it today, but it is the same provision--is this:

   Mr. GRAMM. I think that is correct. I stand corrected. I would like it printed in the RECORD, but I would be happy  to hear the distinguished Democratic ranking member of the committee explain to us the differences. I assert that there are no significant differences, but I would like to hear them. 
   Let me go over basically what we have in terms of additions to CRA in the pending amendment, if the Senate decided to adopt it. 
   No. 1, by making noncompliance with CRA or falling out of compliance with CRA a violation of banking law, officers and directors of banks for the first time could be fined up to $1 million a day for CRA noncompliance. I will come back to this in a moment. 
   Under this substitute, banks can be fined up to $1 million a day for falling out of compliance. 
   Under this substitute, cease and desist authority for CRA noncompliance are brought into the system. 
   Bank regulators may place any restrictions on any banking activities for CRA noncompliance. 
   Bank regulators may place any restrictions on any insurance activities for CRA noncompliance. 
   Bank regulators may place any restrictions on any securities activities for CRA noncompliance. 
   Bank regulators may place any restrictions on any other activities of the holding company for CRA noncompliance. 
   Any violation by any one bank in the holding company can trigger penalties against any and all activities of the entire banking company. 
   Insurance sales of bank subsidiaries can be restricted for CRA noncompliance. 
   Finally, the provision adds new expansions of CRA far beyond the existing law. Under current law, banks sell insurance--small banks in cities of less than 5,000, other banks depending on their State regulation--and they do it without CRA approval. 
   The substitute would expand the decision of banks or ability of banks to sell insurance to require CRA approval. Some 20 banks now provide some security services. They do it without being required to get CRA approval. The pending substitute would expand CRA approval to that activity. 
   The first point I want to make is, contrary to the rhetoric being used, we are talking about the largest, most significant expansion of CRA in history--none of which is based on any assertion of any abuse--and we are talking about imposing confiscatory penalties that are devastating to our banking industry. 
   I want to read pieces of two letters on this issue of the potential for a million-dollar-a-day fine. One letter is from the Independent Community Bankers of America. This is a letter from an organization of very, very small, generally community banks, often in rural areas that would be affected by this. Let me read the paragraph:  
   We also have grave concerns about expanding CRA enforcement authority to include the levying of heavy fines and penalties against banks or their officers and directors. An ongoing challenge for many community banks in small communities is finding willing and qualified bank directors. Legislation following the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s greatly increased the amount of civil money penalties to which bank officers and directors may be subject. Any increase in the potential for fines and penalties could provide further disincentive for service on a bank board.  
   Here is the point. If a small bank is going to hire somebody to be president or be an officer or recruit somebody to be on a bank board, they are going to have to buy liability insurance to protect that person from this potential fine, which would literally put thousands of rural banks in America out of compliance. 
   If there is a problem here that needs to be fixed, if there is an abuse that should be dealt with, then one might say that perhaps this is justified. But here is the record: There have been some 16,380 examinations of small, rural banks in America since 1990, and of those 16,380 examinations, three banks and S&Ls have been found to be out of compliance to a substantial degree. 
   Our ranking member of the committee would bring in the potential for a million-dollar-a-day fine based on the fact that in 16,380 audits on CRA since 1990--9 years--there have been three banks substantially out of compliance. What is the justification for these massive punitive fines? There is no justification. 
   The justification basically is that this is seen as an opportunity to massively expand CRA. That is what the justification is. 
   The second letter, on exactly the same subject, is from the American Bankers Association. Here is what they say:  
   We would oppose amendments we understand may be offered that would contain provisions not only eliminating the two CRA provisions currently in the bill, but also adding additional new CRA requirements. One strong concern the ABA has is that the potential for such penalties could discourage directors from serving on community bank boards and increase the cost of officer and director liability insurance coverage for banks. There has been no justification given for inserting these new penalties into CRA, particularly given the outstanding record the banking industry has in serving communities across the country.  
   I remind my colleagues, this substitute seeks to impose these massive punitive penalties against small banks in America when in 16,380 exams, which cost those banks cumulatively $1,310,400,000 to keep the records and comply with the exam--$1,310,400,000; I have the decimal points right this time--after all that money, after all those exams, three small, rural banks or S&Ls were found substantially out of compliance. 
   If this is not regulatory overkill that drives working men and women in America crazy and that threatens little banks all over the State of Kansas, the State of the Presiding Officer, and all over Indiana and all over Texas and all over America, that threatens their very existence, I don't know what it is. 
   First of all, this is totally unjustified, makes absolutely no sense and, to quote my colleague from Maryland, never has a hearing been held on this subject. Never has any justification been given whatsoever for imposing a million-dollar fine on bank board members and bank officers in the name of CRA. It is the most gross overkill and regulatory burden that this Senator has seen in the entire time that I have been debating banking legislation. 
   I remind my colleagues that I spent 12 years of my life teaching money and banking in college. I have spent too long of my life, 21 years, in the House and Senate, and I have been serving on the Banking Committee every day I have been in the Senate, and I have had the privilege this year of serving as chairman. I have never seen such a massive regulatory overkill as these proposed provisions, and I am confident that they will be rejected.

   Mr. GRAMM. I can tell you where it comes from. It comes from looking at the banks and S&Ls that meet two tests: One, they have less than $100 million of assets; and, two, they operate solely outside standard metropolitan areas. 
   And my figure is, that those banks have been subjected, since 1990, to 16,380 examinations. And in those 16,380 examinations, the average of which has cost that little bank about $80,000, according to some 488 banks which have written us on this subject, that these 16,380 examinations--this is from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council--that in these 16,380 examinations, costing, on average, $80,000 apiece--so this is $1.3 billion that has been taken out of these little bitty communities and out of their banks, where people are paid higher interest rates and have gotten less credit--the result of that has been that three of these banks, over a 9-year period, have been found to be in substantial noncompliance. 
   You do not have to have a Ph.D. in mathematics to figure out, if you have done 16,380 exams on these small, rural banks, and only three of them have been in substantial noncompliance, you  are spending a tremendous amount of their money to find a very, very small number of bad actors--in fact, three one-hundredths of 1 percent. 
   What is even more astounding is that all of these little banks combined make up only 2.8 percent of the capital of the banking system. They are getting 44 percent of the examinations. They make up only 2.7 percent of the assets of the banking system, and out of 16,380 exams, only three of them were out of compliance.

   Mr. GRAMM. If I might reclaim my time--and I think probably we would be better off to let me go through and make my presentation and let the Senator do the same--let me go back and restate the facts. 
   What the Senator has done is basically taken a totally different classification than I am talking about. I have been very clear in what I am saying. Here is what I am saying. And it is devastating, there is no question about that. I am glad I am not on the other side of this argument. I would be trying to change the subject, if I were. But here are the devastating facts. 
   The devastating facts are, that of the little banks in America--less than $100 million in deposits; probably have 6 to 10 employees--that are outside standard metropolitan areas--so these are banks that do not have a city to serve, much less an inner city.

   Mr. GRAMM. Look, let me go ahead. I will explain the difference in what you are saying and what I am saying. OK. So let me start at the top. I will go all the way down, make my point, and then I want to go on and give my presentation. You all have had many opportunities to give yours today. And I listened to them faithfully. 
   But here is the point, if you take every bank in America that has less than $100 million of deposits, and that is also outside a standard metropolitan area, they make up 38 percent of the financial institutions in the country. They have 44 percent of the 
   audits. In fact, they were audited for CRA 16,380 times from 1990 through 1998. 
   In those 16,380 audits, that cost, on average--cost the bank; I am not talking about the Government regulator; but cost the bank to comply with gathering all the information, spending the week in the audit, keeping all the records, designating a CRA officer--and I will later in my presentation read actual letters from the banks--these little banks and these little communities spent $1.3 billion of their money complying with this law. 
   Of these 16,380 examinations, only three banks, over a period of 9 years, only three banks were found to be substantially out of compliance. 
   Our colleague has taken a different definition, ``marginally out of compliance,'' and the number was bigger, maybe 70 out of 16,380. The point being, my statement is true, that only three banks, out of all of these that are audited, have turned out to be substantially out of compliance. 
   On the basis of that, our colleague would impose a $1 million-a-day fine on officers and board members. And I stand by my point that that is the biggest overkill I have seen. 
   I think I have dealt with the proposals made which would be added by the amendment that is pending. 
   These proposals really boil down to punitive, crushing, regulatory burden and fines, imposing a $1 million-a-day fine on bank officers and bank board members, massively expanding CRA. 
   The justification in 1977 for CRA was, ``Well, you've got deposit insurance. That's a good subsidy. We ought to be able to force these institutions to allocate capital for a public purpose.'' But for the first time, this substitute would expand CRA to a noninsured institution where there is no logic for its expansion. For the first time, CRA approval would be necessary for selling insurance and selling securities within a bank or at an affiliate of a bank holding company. 
   These are massive expansions of regulatory burden. They are totally unjustified based on any facts, no matter how you read them. I cannot believe that a majority of the Senators would vote to do those things. 
   Let me talk about what we undo if we adopt the Senator's amendment. And I want to take some time to go through this. I have not done this at great length. 
   I want people to understand what is the problem with CRA that we are trying to deal with in these two very modest amendments which the Banking Committee has written. 
   First of all, let me talk about what you can view as good news. In 1977, there was a rider to a bill that was written by Senator Proxmire that created what we today call CRA. It said that banks should lend in the communities where they collect deposits. There was no enforcement mechanism. It was simply to be used when evaluating approval for bank mergers and branches.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will make the following point. We go back and forth to try to keep some balance in the debate. 
   I think when people have a real question that it is a logical thing to do. But when questions used really disrupt the flow of the debate so that you have long periods of time on one side of the aisle, I don't think it is quite fair. Obviously under the rules we can do it, but it can be done on both sides. 
   I would like to just suggest--we are going to vote on this at about 7 o'clock. We have plenty of time. Everybody can be heard. I would just like to suggest that we go back and forth. Everybody will get a chance to speak. 
   I urge our colleagues, if you have a real question on something you don't know--other than, ``Do you realize that our proposal is a great proposal and their proposal is a rotten proposal?''--yes, I realize that--if you have a real question, I think it makes sense. But in fairness to what we try to do in going back and forth, I urge people to wait for their time to speak so we have debate on both sides of the aisle. That is my point. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, you will hardly know where to begin when you have listened to these speeches for a couple hours, and most of them have nothing whatsoever to do with what we are talking about on the floor. 
   It reminds me of the old Lincoln adage, where Lincoln was engaged in a debate, and the guy debating Lincoln got up and gave a wonderful speech that had nothing to do with the subject being debated; and Lincoln got up and said that his colleague had given a wonderful speech that would be appropriate for another day and another occasion. 
   I want to go through, roughly, 10 points that have been raised in all these speeches, and then go back to what we are debating. 
   No. 1, we have had a lot of speeches for CRA. And one would get the idea in listening to these speeches that someone is proposing to repeal CRA. In fact, as far as I am aware, no one has ever offered an amendment or bill since 1977 proposing repeal of CRA. 
   Whether the record for CRA is as wonderful as our colleagues have claimed, have we built more houses because the economy is better or because of CRA? Who wants to get into that debate? Because it is not relevant to what we are talking about, nobody is talking about repealing CRA. 
   No. 2, nobody is talking about ``turning back the clock.'' What we are talking about is dealing with abuses that exist in the current system, and that can and should be fixed. One of those abuses basically has to do with extraordinary power that protesters and protest groups have at critical moments when banks are trying to make  decisions. The second has to do with the relevancy of CRA, and which banks under what circumstances have relevant requirements, and what are the regulatory burdens and costs involved. 
   In terms of a point that was made way back so many speeches ago--I forget which one it was--that in 99 percent of the cases where banks apply to do something that requires CRA evaluation, nobody challenges that action, that is a very misleading number, really, for a number of reasons. 
   First, most of these applications concern the opening or closing branches. They are not very relevant. It is basically the mergers and acquisitions that are relevant to CRS protests. 
   Second, as I have pointed out on many occasions, most of the CRA action takes place not in the formal complaint, but basically when the protester goes to the bank threatening that unless the bank takes certain action, often giving that person money, that they are going to file a complaint. So it never shows up in the statistics. So that is all interesting but largely irrelevant. 
   One of our colleagues said that I said, or someone had said, that CRA is just an extortion program. No one ever made that statement. What I have said is that CRA has become a vehicle where a tremendous number of actions occur that certainly look like extortion. When you look at contracts that are being signed, these individuals and groups are given large sums of money, and then they sign a commitment that they will withdraw their objection. That is a classic quid pro quo, that is the essence of extortion or bribery or kickbacks. There are a lot of names you can use. But no one has suggested any of them in this debate. Many, most, almost all of the people involved in CRA are conscientious and honest. 
   We are talking about people here who are abusing the system. And even spokesmen for CRA, even spokesmen for community groups, say there are abuses, that the abuses undercut the system. As everybody who is on the Banking Committee knows, when the CRA advocates testified before the Banking Committee, a clear point was made that abuses do occur. They called the abuses ``greenmail.'' I think the standard term is ``blackmail,'' but nobody disputes that they occur. 
   What we are trying to do is to deal with them. 
   In terms of half the banks being out of compliance, half the banks being affected, there isn't any proposal that would let half the banks out of CRA. Basically, the proposal in the underlying bill is that banks with less than $100 million in assets and which are also in nonmetropolitan areas, in rural areas, that these banks be exempt from CRA. Now, why? 
   First of all, since 1990, over a 9-year period, there have been 16,380 examinations of these small rural banks; 16,380 times Federal regulators have gone to these rural banks. They have sat down for days and weeks, looking through their records. They have done reports to determine whether these rural banks are lending in their community and meeting their community reinvestment requirements. 
   After 16,380 examinations, only 3 banks have been found to be substantially out of compliance. The cost of complying with CRA for these examinations to the small banks has been roughly $80,000 a year, according to the 488 letters we have received from small banks on this subject. 
   That is $1.3 billion of cost imposed on small banks. I have read at great length letters about how small banks can't serve their customers because they have to do all this paperwork and how it is interfering with community lending. I have read some passionate letters on this subject on the floor of the Senate in this debate. I am not going to reread them now. 
   The point is, $1.3 billion later, 16,380 examinations later, crushing paperwork, cost burden on very small banks, many of them between 6 and 10 employees, $1.3 billion of costs banks have paid, and only 3 small rural banks have been found to be substantially out of compliance. 
   What does our bill do? It exempts from CRA very small, very rural banks. In total, in terms of the number of banks, that is about 38 percent of the banks in America. In terms of available capital, as you can see from this chart, that is 2.7 percent of all the assets in all the banks and S&Ls in America. 
   Now, the logical question is this: 44 percent of our auditing effort is going into banks that have only 2.7 percent of the assets, and they have been found to be substantially out of compliance only 3/100 of 1 percent of the time. Is this not massive regulatory overkill? What does this have to do with meeting community needs for loans? If there has ever been an overreach in regulatory terms, imposing $1.3 billion of cost on little banks and little communities to turn up three banks in 9 years that have been substantially out of compliance, this is regulatory overkill. We are trying to fix it. 
   In terms of exemption based on a 3-year record, one of my frustrations in debating on the Senate floor--and I guess all of us can be accused of doing it; I try to, at least within my own mind, be careful about things I say. I try to put my argument in the best light I can. Everybody else does. I try not to say things I don't believe to be true. But we continue to hear these things like, if a bank has been in compliance three times, they are exempt from CRA. That is not what our bill does. 
   Here is what our bill does. Let me explain the problem. In fact, let me have that quote from the law professor at Cornell. This quote is from Cornell law professor Jonathan Macey. Jonathan Macey is one of our Nation's premier experts in banking law and is very knowledgeable in this whole area of application of CRA. In evaluating what is happening, this is basically what he says:  
   You see really weird things when you look at the code of Federal regulations ..... like Federal regulators are encouraged to leave the room and allowing community groups to negotiate ex parte with bankers in a community reinvestment context. ..... Giving jobs to the top five officials of these communities or shake-down groups is generally high up on the list (of demands). So, what we really have is a bit of old world Sicily brought into the U.S., but legitimized and given the patina of government support.  
   Let me see those CRA agreements, if you will stack all those back up there one more time. I am going to zip through them real quickly. 
   One of our problems in evaluating what happened to the $9 billion of cash payments that were made under CRA--something never contemplated; nobody on the Banking Committee in 1977, I don't believe, thought CRA would ultimately produce cash payments being made to individuals and to groups; they thought, as we have heard arguments all day, that CRA is about lending--we don't know where all this money goes. We don't know what percentage of rake-offs, for example, these groups get on loans banks make, because we don't have the records. These CRA agreements are confidential; they are not made public. That is something later that we hope to change. 
   But let me just say, I have three pieces of CRA agreements. These are all private agreements where the parties have agreed not to make them public. We have redacted the names to protect the people who committed not to make them public. 
   The point I am trying to make here is how far away from lending, as we conventionally know it, this is. 
   This is from Bank A: Provide blank--this is the CRA group--with a grant of up to $20,000. Provide blank with a grant of up to $50,000. Provide blank with a grant of up to $25,000. And on this one they say why: to pay reasonable and necessary soft costs incurred. Provide blank with a grant of a reasonable amount. 
   And then after they agree to pay that money, look at this provision: Blank agrees to withdraw on the date hereof the comment letter, dated blank 28, 19 blank, and any related materials filed by blank with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the board--and it goes on. 
   The point is, on one page they give all these grants to groups, and then on the second page the groups agree to withdraw the complaints they filed against the action the banks want to make. 
   Here is the point: Did the groups file the complaints to get the money? What about the legitimacy of the complaint? Did it go away when they got the money? 
   It goes on. We are getting more and more of these every day. Then, in every one of these agreements we have seen,  there is an agreement by the community group or the individual and the bank not to disseminate or otherwise make available to the public copies of this agreement. 
   Here is a second bank agreement, Bank B: Blank will receive a fee of 2 and three quarters percent of the face amount of each program loan made by blank. 
   Now, I wonder if people in that community realize that this undisclosed individual, or group, is getting a rake-off of 2.75 percent of the face value of every loan that is being made by this bank. Blank will receive a $200,000 fee as reimbursement, $100,000 payable fund, execution and delivery, $100,000 6 months from now. That is the quid. Here is the quo: The group commits to withdraw all pending protests of regulatory applications and related matters, but not to sponsor, either directly or indirectly, to protest or supply information in connection with any protest relating to the pending or future blank applications with bank regulators. 
   In other words, it doesn't matter what abuses the bank might do in the future. They are never going to protest again because of this. At the request to send letters to the customers of the bank--well, let me go on. Not only do they agree never to protest again on any issue, but they agree to purge the files and data bases of all information relating to the bank's customers. 
   Now, it goes on: to immediately cease all activities directed against the bank; to maintain the confidentiality of this agreement--they have confidentiality again here--and then: to cooperate with the community group, to help them use this agreement to leverage other financial institutions to get money from them. In other words, not only are they paying this money, they are going to help them get other banks to pay it. 
   It is funny how little things grab you. Maybe it is just me, but this one hits me the hardest. I was wondering why we were getting these letters from banks in favor of CRA when the bank officers were telling me--and in some cases saying publicly--that CRA was blackmail. Yet, I was getting letters from these banks saying CRA is great. Well, here is the reason: 
   Blank will work with the blank to establish a clear, written declaratory statement indicating support for the Community Reinvestment Act and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the party's opposition to any attempts to weaken the law. Blank will send the final copy of this statement to the blank. 
   In other words, they will let them go over and rewrite the letter they are going to send. And they are going to send the letter to the American Bankers Association, Federal Reserve Board, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the whole congressional delegation of their State, and to all members of the House and Senate Banking Committees. 
   So, Senator BENNETT, when you got a letter from this bank telling you that CRA is the greatest thing that has ever been, you probably did not know that was the result of a CRA agreement so that a bank could do business in America. And we are not talking about Honduras; we are not talking about Thailand. We are talking about the United States of America, and we have banks--some of the richest and most powerful institutions in America--that are having dictated to them at this very moment that they have to write us letters telling us things they do not believe. How is that happening? How can that be happening in America? I ask you, how can it happen? 
   Not only is it happening, it is being condoned because, as the law professor from Cornell said, we have given the patina of Government support to something that if it happened to an American bank in Thailand, we would file an unfair trade practice against them. 
   So when you are getting all these letters telling you how wonderful CRA is from banks, remember this agreement. In fact, I received such a letter from a particular bank. Fortunately, to show you this is a very good and honorable bank, they say in their letter they have been forced to send this letter as a result of a CRA agreement. 
   I discovered this letter because there was an editorial written attacking the bill quoting this bank, or this letter, interestingly enough. There was an editorial written quoting a 
   letter from First Union Corporation, a wonderful, great bank. They were quoted in the editorial as saying how great CRA was and why we should not be making any changes to the bill. Well, I said I want to see this letter. So we got the letter. Let me read the first paragraph:  
   As part of a CRA pledge we made during our merger with CoreStates, First Union National Bank committed to send a written statement to certain individuals or organizations clearly expressing our position on CRA and HMDA regulations. We, as an organization, are very committed to serving all of our communities, including underserved areas. We are happy to provide this statement.  
   Then they go on to say that nothing in the letter is meant to be an endorsement or opposition to any particular bill. I know we have one of the most distinguished former prosecutors in America sitting in the Chair. I have to say--not to speak for him, because in his role as Presiding Officer, he can't speak until he comes down here--what is the difference between this and the old protection racket that existed when I was a child? I am proud to say that my uncles, as sheriffs and police officers, broke up some of those protection rackets. But the only difference is that this is Government; this is the Federal Government that is basically allowing this to happen. 
   Now, we are not talking about repealing CRA. We are not talking about ending a program that obviously has had many successes. We are talking about trying to deal with abuse. So what are the two things we do? No. 1, we say that if a bank has a history of being in compliance with the law, if they have been evaluated 3 years in a row and been found to be in compliance with CRA, and if they are presently in compliance with CRA, then any individual or group can protest, file a complaint; and under the existing regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency, there has to be a hearing for any complaint that is lodged. 
   But what our amendment adds is the requirement that if this bank has a long history of being in compliance, before the regulator can stop the action that they have earned the right to undertake, the protester must present some substantial evidence. In other words, if you are a good actor and you have been evaluated 3 years in a row and were found to be in compliance, you are innocent until proven guilty. Somebody can't just walk in and say a banker is a racist and a loan shark. 
   Some protesters have done exactly that. There is a CRA protester who calls himself an ``urban terrorist,'' who used those charges against a bank, harassed them for 4 years, went to a speech of the president of the bank at Harvard University, disrupted the speech, made this man's life miserable for 4 long years, until the bank gave him $1.4 million and a $200,000 grant and set up an organization that now lends $3.5 billion, totally unregulated by the Federal Government. He gets a 2.75-percent rake-off of each one of those loans, and nobody knows what he does with the money. He is not accountable to anybody. 
   Now, all we want to do is say if a bank has consistently been in compliance and you want to stop them from merging with another bank, or opening a branch, you have to present some evidence. Now, what is the standard we have used? The Presiding Officer, as a distinguished attorney and former prosecutor, knows that substantial evidence is the most defined term in American law. It is referred to over 900 times in the United States Code. 
   There have been 400 court decisions that have defined ``substantial evidence.'' 
   So what standard do we require a protester to meet if he tries to impose potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in costs on a bank, and to stop a bank from doing what it appears to be qualified to do? They have to present evidence. 
   Here are four standards set by the Supreme Court as to what ``substantial evidence'' means: 
   They have to present evidence that is understood to mean ``more than a mere scintilla.'' 
   That is a standard we are setting. You can't come in and stop a bank with a consistent record of CRA compliance. You can't automatically stop, shut down, and delay the process unless you present evidence that is ``more than a mere scintilla.'' 
   Unless you present such relevant evidence as a ``reasonable mind might''--  notice it didn't say ``would,'' but ``might''-- ``accept as adequate to support a claim.'' 
   You have to present evidence that is real, material, not ``seeming or imaginary,'' and considerable in amount, value, and worth. 
   Why in the world would we stand by and allow a bank that has complied with the law of the land and been evaluated three times in a row as being in compliance to be prevented from exercising a right they have earned unless somebody presents credible evidence, substantial evidence, to the contrary? I don't understand. Why would anybody be against this change? 
   I continue to be stunned that our colleagues talk about CRA and how wonderful it is. That is not what we are talking about. 
   Should you have to present some evidence if you are going to try to deny people the rights they earned under the law? How can that be unfair? How can that be reaching? How can that be burdensome? Who could be against that? 
   The second provision of the bill provides relief to small banks in rural areas. I have gone through the figures: $1.3 billion later, in this decade of audits and costs imposed on the banks, three small rural banks--three one-hundredths of 1 percent--are bad actors. Is that not regulatory overkill? 
   We have forced little banks, many with just 6 to 10 employees, to pay $1.3 billion in compliance costs, and in 16,380 examinations, only 3 of them have been deemed to be substantially out of compliance. Does that make sense? Is that crazy? Did I miss something? 
   I could read to you letter after letter. We have had 488 letters from banks urging the committee to take this action. I have read them before; I will not do so again. 
   Finally, let me remind my colleagues that the amendment that is pending doesn't just strike these two provisions--the ``integrity and relevance'' provisions--it does far more than that. It would create a situation where individual officers and directors of a bank could potentially be fined up to $1 million a day for noncompliance. 
   Remember, in these little banks you have 16,380 examinations over the decade, and just 3 banks have been found to be substantially out of compliance. What is the justification for this $1-million-a-day fine? 
   I have letters from the American Bankers Association, and from the Independent Bankers Association, pointing out the obvious. 
   This provision that has been offered by our colleague from Nevada, and was offered in committee by Senator SARBANES, will make it virtually impossible for small banks to get quality directors, because who can afford that potential liability? It will make it virtually impossible for small banks, who can't buy the insurance to protect people from liability, to hire quality bank officials. 
   The bill goes on and on and on in the most massive overkill of expanding CRA to nonbanking activities. Currently, a bank can sell insurance without CRA approval. This substitute that is now 
   pending would require CRA approval for that. Banks can sell securities without CRA approval. This takes CRA out of banking and into other areas. 
   What is the justification for that? The justification for requiring CRA was that banks have a federal subsidy through deposit insurance. So that is public insurance, and making banks do things in the public interest could be justified. But how does expanding that requirement outside banking make any sense? Are we simply going to keep writing laws telling people what to do with this money? 
   Basically we have a choice. The choice is the following: 
   Both of these provisions concern CRA. The bill that was adopted by the Banking Committee has two reforms--one an integrity provision, and one a relevancy provision. The amendment that has been offered strikes both of those reforms and imposes all of these new regulations. 
   So I think it is as clear a choice as you can make. 
   Just a couple of other points, and I will stop, because I know that others want to speak. One of our colleagues quoted the Wall Street Journal. The Wall Street Journal has editorialized not once but twice in favor of the position the committee has taken here. 
   I urge my colleagues again to look at the debate--not get carried away or be confused by people who say the committee has gutted CRA, is killing CRA, or is repealing CRA. We are not doing any of those things. But we are dealing with abuses of CRA. They need to be dealt with. They scream out to be dealt with. 
   If I could make a plea to the other side, it would be a simple and short plea: If we don't fix the abuses of CRA, by the time we are through letting people know what is happening in terms of these $9 billion of cash payments, and by the time we finally do run down and know where all of this money is going, and we find that much of it--or some of it--is not being used to benefit people who are supposed to be benefiting from community loans, I think it is going to undercut CRA. 
   If I were a strong proponent of CRA, I would be for these reforms, because they clean up a program that clearly has had an impact. But our colleagues--as they did on welfare--it was abused and abused and abused and abused and abused. But they would never ever, ever, ever say that it should be fixed. Finally, the American people rose up and elected a new Congress. We are probably in the majority because of their intransigence. So God does provide His services from time to time. And then it was fixed. They probably could have had it closer to what they wanted had they been willing to fix it. 
   But the position we have heard today over and over is, never ever, ever, ever will we allow any change whatsoever, no matter how bad the abuse is in CRA. 
   I don't understand it. I think it is an extreme view. I hope that even yet, by the time we get through conference, by the time we have had a chance to discuss this over many more times, perhaps there can be a compromise. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this has been a long debate and I think a good debate. Rather than trying to go back and answer specific points that have been made, and correct statements, let me just try to cut to the heart of this. This is not about banks, even though the Independent Bankers, the American Bankers Association, the Bankers Roundtable oppose this amendment and support the underlying bill. 
   This is not about insurance companies. This is not about securities companies. This is about right and wrong. I have presented today, from redacted agreements, secret agreements that have been entered into by community groups and banks, three examples, the only three we have, where over and over again community groups are paid cash payments in return for them withdrawing objections which they have made to banks taking specific action, or where they have agreed not to raise an objection. 
   So the first thing we are trying to do is bring integrity to the process by preventing people, in essence, from paying witnesses. How do we try to do that? We try to do it in the following way: If you are a bank and you have an excellent CRA record, you have been in compliance for three audits in a row and you are in compliance now--we do not in any way limit the ability of anybody to object to that bank doing what it has a right to do under law--all we are saying is you are innocent until proven guilty if you have a long record of compliance. If you are going to come in and prevent a bank from taking an action they have earned the right to do based on audits on community lending, and you come in and say they are 
   racists, or they are loan sharks, that is not enough. What we require is you present substantial evidence. 
   How is that defined? The Supreme Court defines substantial evidence as ``more than a mere scintilla ..... such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a claim.'' 
   That is not a high standard. That is simply a credibility standard. And all over America--we have professional protesters in Boston who are protesting bank mergers in Illinois. What do they have to do with community lending in Illinois? Nothing. But they file a protest. The bank is deathly afraid of being held up in its merger, for example. Obviously, they do not want to be called bad names by people who are professionals at calling people bad names. So they end up paying these groups cash. That is not right. 
   This is an issue of right and wrong. The second issue is the issue relating to small banks. Little banks in rural communities in total hold only 2 percent of the assets of banks, but in 16,300 audits of these banks, each one of them on average cost the bank $80,000 to comply with. They found three banks in 9 years that are substantially out of compliance. They made these little banks pay $1.3 billion to find three bad actors. And little banks all over America are threatened by this regulatory burden. So we exempt them from it. 
   Mr. President, 44 percent of the enforcement effort is going to banks with 2.8 percent of the capital. Take that enforcement effort and put it where the money is and you will get more community lending, not less. 
   Finally, it is not as if the Sarbanes amendment simply strikes our provisions. But the Sarbanes amendment is the largest expansion of CRA in American history. 
   It would impose a million-dollar-a-day fine on bank officers and board members if they fell out of compliance. The American Bankers Association and the Independent Bankers Association have urged us not to do this, because they will not be able to get board members to serve and they will not be able to hire officers if they have to buy insurance to potentially pay a million-dollar-a-day fine if they fall out of compliance with this regulation. 
   What is the justification for this regulatory overkill when you have had three cases of substantial noncompliance out of 16,300 audits over 9 years? What is wrong with this picture? 
   What is wrong with the picture is, sadly, that many of our Democrat colleagues have decided, even though the spokesman for CRA testifying before our committee said, yes, there are abuses and, yes, they hurt the process and, yes, there is what they call green mail. Most people call it blackmail. But our colleagues have taken the extreme position that not only will they not address these abuses, they are going to vastly expand this to insurance, to securities and, with these million-dollar-a-day fines, producing a situation where every abuse we are concerned about today is going to be greatly expanded. 
   I urge our Democrat colleagues, if you support CRA, to help us bring an end to these abuses. If you support CRA, end the regulatory paperwork burden overkill so we can focus in this law on the real problem. While groups claim we are endangering CRA, it is those who will not fix clear wrongs that scream out that endanger it. 
   Mr. President, I move to table the pending amendment and ask for the yeas and the nays.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me try to outline the procedure that we have agreed to by unanimous consent as we begin the debate on financial services modernization. We have agreed to have opening statements. I guess we will assume that the rest of the morning will be used up in those opening statements. I will make an opening statement, the ranking member of the committee, Senator SARBANES, will make an opening statement, and then all those who would like to make an opening statement are encouraged to come to the floor and do those statements this morning. 
   Under the unanimous consent agreement, Senator SARBANES would then offer a comprehensive substitute for the committee mark. That would be debated for the remainder of the morning--if there is any morning left when it is introduced--and this afternoon. When debate on that is completed, a vote would be set. It is my assumption, since we have colleagues from two States who have had a terrible natural disaster and have gone home this morning to assist in making the evaluations that will help us respond to that through our Federal emergency programs, my assumption is that we will set aside the vote until some time tomorrow when they can come back. 
   Under the unanimous consent agreement, at the end of the Sarbanes amendment, I, or my designee, would be recognized to offer two amendments. Those amendments will be offered and debated. And then, depending on where we are in terms of our colleagues coming back from their States that have had the natural disasters, we would begin the voting process. 
   The final part of the unanimous consent agreement would be a fourth amendment that Senator SARBANES, or his designee, would offer, and that would be an amendment that would strike the CRA provisions of the committee bill and insert the provisions related to CRA, which are in the Sarbanes substitute. That would get us four amendments into the process, and we would then begin the normal debate process where the floor would be open to those who seek recognition. 
   I know that it is the hope of our leadership that we would finish the bill this week. I don't see any reason that we can't do that. Let me say, as we begin this debate, I am willing to stay here late at night, through the night, if we need to in order to have a full debate on these issues. I think we all recognize that under the Senate rules everybody gets to have their say. Everybody gets an opportunity to offer amendments. I am hopeful that we can complete this process by Thursday. We have a long trail to follow to complete the bill. 
   As many people in the Senate are aware, the House has a divided jurisdiction. The House committee has acted on the bill, the Banking Committee; but the Commerce Committee, which has joint jurisdiction, is now in the process, on a bipartisan basis, of writing a bill that is very different. So I am hopeful that by this Thursday we can complete this bill and start moving toward conference and toward all the work that still lies before us. 
   I would be happy to yield to Senator SARBANES.

   Mr. GRAMM. I don't see any reason why we can't accommodate each other. We want to have a full debate. Much of the essence of the differences that exist are embodied in the first and fourth amendments. I think having a full debate is what we should do. I think it is important that people understand the issues, and I can certainly say, from my point of view, I think the better people understand these issues, the better off we are. 
   We are here to debate the most important banking bill in 60 years today. This bill would dramatically change the American financial system. It would knock down existing barriers that separate insurance and banking and separate securities and banking. It would create a new financial institution in America, which would still be a bank or a bank holding company, would still have the same structure, but it would be a very different institution, and it would be basically a supermarket for financial services. 
   Let me say, in going into the process, that my goal is to put together a bill that will provide greater diversity and financial services at a lower price to American consumers. If this bill does not meet the test of providing benefit in terms of a greater diversity and availability of product, if it doesn't meet the test of providing a lower cost for those products, for the people who do the work and pay the taxes and pull the wagon in America, then it would be my view that we have failed in this bill. That, I think, is the test that we need to use in order to judge our success or lack thereof on this bill. 
   In terms of barriers erected between insurance and banking and between securities and banking, most of these barriers erected in the 1920s and 1930s, what has happened that has really brought us to this point in terms of legislating this dramatic change in the American financial system is that, over time, these barriers have stopped looking like barriers, and now they look like little slices of Swiss cheese. 
   They have large and small holes in them, some created by innovative regulators, some created by the growth of practice and convention. But the net result is that after fighting each other for 50 years to try to keep other industries out of their individual portion of the financial services industry, these three great economic forces in the American economy--the insurance industry, the banking industry, and the securities industry--have basically concluded that they would be better off in terms of an open field of competition and greater able to meet the needs of their consumers if we simply took down these barriers. 
   Also students of this problem--no matter what their persuasion within limits at the beginning of the debate--have concluded that the instability that exists in allowing these walls that divide these three major financial industries to continue to stand, knowing that these walls have, because of the holes in them, produced this instability and produced an unstable structure in many cases--the basic conclusion has been reached by virtually everyone engaged in the debate that we would be better off to take down these barriers than to leave them standing as they are. The debate today is not about the changes that we make in the name of financial services modernization. 
   That is why I believe and hope that in the end we can reach a consensus where at least 51 Members of the Senate--hopefully more--will vote for the final product of this deliberation.  
   What we are debating is not about what changes are to be made, but how to make those changes. That really involves basically two areas, and they will be the focal point of this debate. 
   The first area is the question of where these new financial services should be provided. Should these new financial services be provided within the bank itself, within the legal structure of the bank, and what capital that is invested in these new parts of the financial services industry will count as the capital of the bank itself? Or should these new financial services be provided by affiliates of holding companies outside the bank? 
   This is a fundamentally important question. It is a question where we have great differences of opinion. It is a question that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, believes is so important that he has said in testimony before the House Commerce Committee that if we had a bill that allowed banks to provide these expanded services within the bank itself, that bill would be so dangerous in terms of providing an unlevel playing surface--in terms of encouraging artificially the concentration of securities products being sold and serviced inside the bank--and the safety and soundness dangers with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would be so great, that he and every member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board have taken a position that it would be better to pass no financial services modernization than to undertake to allow banks to provide these new services within the bank itself. 
   The White House and the Treasury have taken exactly the opposite position--they favor a bill where banks can provide these services within the legal structure of the bank. 
   It is my understanding--I have not seen it, but it is my understanding--that we have another veto threat from the President. The number of items the President is threatening to veto has grown, and now we have gone from four items in his first letter to six items, some of which, it is my understanding, would also apply to the Sarbanes substitute and to the House bill, further raising some question about the administration's degree of seriousness about this bill. 
   That is our first issue. Should banks provide the new expanded financial services within the structure of the bank itself, or should they be forced to take capital out of the bank and invest it through their holding company in these separate and independent entities that, while affiliated with the bank holding 
   company, will be independent of the bank? 
   That is probably the most important issue that we will vote on. I will say more about it later in my opening statement. You will hear a lot more about it as we get further into the debate. 
   Inevitably in a big bill like this, subsidiary issues take on great importance. One issue that has taken on very great importance in this bill is community reinvestment. I will talk more about this later when we turn to these two areas of dispute. 
   But let me say the real question here boils down to this simple question: Should we have a massive expansion in CRA and CRA enforcement and with it a massive expansion in regulatory burden, or should we reform the existing program to try to eliminate the growing abuse that is occurring in that program and the growing regulatory burden that exists in that program? 
   That will be the second major issue that we will deal with as part of this bill. 
   Before I turn to a discussion about what the underlying committee bill does, I just want to say a few words of thanks to people that have been important in putting this bill together. 
   I first want to thank Senator BRYAN and Senator JOHNSON for their help in committee in making many elements of this bill a bipartisan bill. 
   I joined with Senator BRYAN to adopt a provision related to how banks would sell insurance. 
   I thank Senator JOHNSON from South Dakota, who joined with Senator SHELBY in supporting an amendment to exempt very small rural banks from the regulatory burden of CRA. 
   I think the action by these two Senators really set a standard that we ought to work to meet in the rest of this bill. 
   I thank my Republican colleagues who sat through many long seminars on financial services modernization, for lack of a better term. I thank them for doing this with a minimum of complaint. I think the net result is that by and large the Republican members of the Banking Committee understand this issue better than we did when this issue was discussed last year. I think the net result is that we have a better bill. 
   I would like to thank all of my staff on the majority side of the committee. But I especially want to thank our staff director, Wayne Abernathy, our chief counsel, Linda Lord, and our financial economist, Steve McMillin, for all the work they have done on this bill and the work that they have done to make the bill better. 
   Finally, let me just express a regret. I regret that I have not done a better job in working with Senator SARBANES. We have had a difficult time in working together to forge a bipartisan bill. Some of this is inevitable, I think. Some of it is not. I just want to say that my inability to work with Senator SARBANES on this bill is something that I regret. I have the highest regard for his intellect and his sincerity on these issues. And while he and I do not agree on many of these issues, I don't doubt for a moment that he understands the issues and he is sincere about the position he has taken. 
   I think that is one of the reasons it is very hard to work out some of these issues, because, as Thomas Jefferson observed long ago, good men with good intentions in a free society often reach different conclusions. When that happens, the best we can do is to simply plow ahead. And that is what we are doing here. 
   Let me try to run through very quickly what I believe are the major elements in the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 as reported by the Senate Banking Committee. First, this bill repeals Glass-Steagall. It knocks down the barriers between insurance and banking and between securities and banking. It chooses to do this for the vast majority of the capital in the banking industry through affiliates of bank holding companies. This bill makes the decision that it is unwise and dangerous to allow large banks to provide these expanded services within the structure of the bank itself. 
   The majority of the members of the committee concluded that Chairman Greenspan is right, that there are strong safety and soundness arguments against allowing banks to provide these expanded services within the structure of the bank itself and that this endangers the taxpayer through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
   Additionally, the majority of the members of the committee were convinced that to give banks the ability to sell these financial products within the structure of the bank, and therefore to give them the ability to internalize the inherent subsidies that are built into FDIC insurance, plus the ability of banks to borrow from the Fed window at the lowest interest rates in the country and use the Fed wire, that these implicit subsidies--which the Federal Reserve Board has estimated to be as high as 12 basis points--would be big enough to assure over time to virtually guarantee a massive degree of economic concentration, concentration whereby banks would end up dominating these markets--not because they are more inherently efficient but because they would have the advantage of the subsidies that come from undertaking these provisions within the bank. 
   This view was very broadly held last year. Senator SARBANES, in the bill he supported, supported this position last year. This was the position of the House bill last year. Now we have a debate as to whether or not the Congress, the Senate committee and the House itself, should reverse its position. This is not a partisan issue. I don't know how the votes are going to fall, and I know partisanship has really entered into this area. Historically, on issues like this there has been a great division on a bipartisan basis. 
   Congressman JOHN DINGELL, who is the ranking Democrat on the House Commerce Committee that has joint jurisdiction on this issue, has taken a very strong position that he will oppose the bill if banks are allowed to  provide these services within the structure of the bank itself. It is clear that the House Commerce Committee is going to take the position of the Senate bill. This is clearly a very important issue. 
   An effort was made in the Senate Banking Committee to try to reach a compromise on this issue, to let very small banks that in general are not big enough to operate holding companies efficiently, yet might in a very small way want to get into other financial services such as securities and insurance--we set out a dividing line of $1 billion of assets and below for smaller banks that together when added up comprise about 18 percent of the capital of our banking system, that we would allow them to use operating subsidiaries, but with special accounting rules so they could expand services and not be precluded from the activity based on their size. However, we require any bank with assets over $1 billion or that has a holding company to use subsidiaries of holding companies so that these services are provided outside the bank. 
   We allow banks to underwrite municipal revenue bonds. We follow functional regulations so that whatever industry you are in, no matter what name is on your marquee, and no matter what business it is associated with, you will be regulated by the regulators who regulate that particular type of activity. We make a strong effort to reduce regulatory burden and streamline the process by giving 
   the Federal Reserve Board the umbrella supervisory ability but requiring them in most instances to use the audits of other agencies. 
   The committee bill takes a very strong position in reaffirming the State regulation of the insurance business. We reaffirm that McCarran-Ferguson is the law of the land, and we require that any institution that is selling insurance in any State comply with the licensing requirements of that State. Our requirement on the State is simply that they have nondiscriminatory requirements. 
   We expand the resolution process, knowing that in the future there will be debate about what products are insurance products or banking products or securities products. We have a resolution process. Then we give equal standing to the contesting regulators before the court. We go to extra lengths to protect small banks and their trust departments. 
   Between 15 percent and 20 percent of the income of many small banks comes from trust departments. There is a very real concern that banks which are providing trust functions that might never get into financial services modernization, that might never open up a securities affiliate or op-sub could find themselves regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and have a dual regulatory burden, are being forced to set up an op-sub or set up a subsidiary simply to continue to do the same things in their trust department that they have always done. 
   We have a very strong provision to protect these small banks, and basically have the preemptive provision that if a bank is providing the service in a trust department today that they cannot be required to set up a separate entity to conduct those same services. 
   We have two CRA provisions in the bill. The first provision has to do with integrity. It is a very simple provision. Unfortunately, in this debate one of my great frustrations is that many people don't want to debate the issue before the Senate. As almost always happens in these cases, especially when you have an emotionally charged issue, people change the subject; they set up straw men and knock them down. 
   Let me make it clear that nothing in this bill in any way repeals CRA. This bill, as reported by the Senate Banking Committee, does two things in CRA. First, it has an integrity provision which says if banks have historically been in compliance with CRA, if in their annual evaluations they have been found to be in compliance not once, not twice, but three times in a row, if they are currently in compliance, then if protest groups or objectors want to come in and object to a bank action, then objector or protester has to present some substantial evidence to suggest that the bank--which has been in compliance 3 years in a row and is currently deemed to be in compliance--is out of compliance. 
   As I will discuss in just a moment, we have a long history of case law as it relates to what ``substantial evidence'' means. But that is the first requirement. It is simply an integrity requirement. It says that if you are in compliance with CRA and you have a long history of being in compliance, someone can't rush in at the last minute on a major bank merger, where hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake, and say they want to undertake a merger and file a protest saying that these two banks are racist or these two banks are loan sharks. 
   These are words that have been used by people who filed these protests--without presenting one scintilla of evidence. In fact, one of the definitions of substantial evidence is ``more than a single scintilla of evidence.'' 
   So this amendment simply says, if you are going to try to prevent a bank from doing something that it has been certified historically on a continuing basis as being in compliance to do, you have to present some substantial evidence to suggest that all these evaluations have been wrong or that something has happened since the last evaluation. 
   I do not understand, personally, why anyone would object to that amendment. We already require in case law that the decisions of administrators at the Federal level be based on substantial evidence. So we are really requiring by statute what is already required under case law, and I will talk about that a little more in just a moment. 
   Our second amendment exempts very small, rural banks from CRA. These are banks that have less than $100 million of assets. These are banks that often have between 6 and 10 employees. And these are banks that are outside standard metropolitan areas. I will talk more in a minute about the regulatory burden that is imposed by CRA on these very small banks, but since many figures have been used by people who have been critical of this proposal, let me say that while 38 percent of the banks and S&Ls in America are very small, rural institutions, together they have only 2.7 percent of the capital that is contained in our banking system nationwide. The basic argument here, which has strong roots in existing banking law and which is supported, to some degree on a bipartisan basis, is that these very small, very rural banks that do not have a city to serve, in most cases, much less an inner city, should not have massive regulatory burden imposed on them through CRA. 
   The next provision of the bill is that we eliminate the SAIF special reserve fund, allowing that money to go into the SAIF itself. 
   We cut off the unitary thrift holding company provision. This is a controversial issue. It will be debated. Let me just give a brief summary of the thinking of the majority of the members of the Banking Committee on this issue. Current law permits commercial companies to own an S&L. This is called a unitary thrift, and a decision was made in our bill to end this provision. 
   So, then the question is what are you going to do about commercial entities that already own S&Ls? The decision we made was to cut off, effective as of the date that we introduced the committee mark, any further applications for a commercial company to own an S&L, so that all of those applications which were filed prior to that date can be evaluated by the Federal regulator, but no new applications would be allowed. 
   There is a second question as to whether we should go so far as to limit the ability of commercial entities that already have thrifts to sell their thrift to another commercial interest. The majority of the members of the Banking Committee concluded that we could go as far as not allowing any new entities to come into existence. But an ex post facto law that goes back and changes the rules that thrifts operate on, after people have already invested their money--many of these entities came in and made investments of hard money during the S&L crisis; many of these commercial entities were encouraged to invest this money and in doing so they saved the taxpayer literally billions of dollars--and to come in now and say not only are we not going to allow any more unitary thrifts to come into existence, something that this bill supports, but we are going to limit what you can do with the thrift you already have, we believe that runs afoul of the takings provision of the fifth amendment of the Constitution.  
   We think it is very important to be aware of that conflict with the Constitution because recently savings and loans have filed suit against the Federal Government based on another bill, FIRREA, 
   where Congress, on an ex post facto basis, went back and took back provisions when these companies entered into a contract with the Federal Government. And we are now told, based on a ruling by the Supreme Court, that we can expect billions of dollars of payments to these S&Ls because the Federal Government has breached its contract. We have set out a line that we are not willing to go over, and that line is we are not willing to violate the Constitution. 
   We have provisions that allow community banks of less than $500 million to be members of and to use the Federal Home Loan Bank. We also allow them to use small business, small farm and small agriculture lending as collateral for loans, and we believe this will improve the liquidity of small banks and their ability to serve their communities. 
   We have a 3-year freeze on existing FICO assessment. We are discussing this issue at great length, but basically when we made a decision to move the two insurance rates to the same level, there was also a discussion about merging the two insurance funds. But Congress never acted on that issue. The majority of the members of the committee in our underlying bill believed there ought to be a discussion about that issue and that we ought to make a decision on that issue. 
   Finally, in terms of the bill itself, we mandate a major GAO study of subchapter S corporations that are engaged in the banking business as a first step toward changing the way we tax very small banks. Many of our colleagues will remember that last year we were able to allow small banks with fewer than 75 shareholders to be taxed as individuals under subchapter S. We are now trying to expand that out to 150 shareholders. This is a very important provision for small banks. 
   Let me review briefly the two major issues of contention in the bill. Operating subs versus affiliates; Chairman Greenspan and all former living Chairmen of the Federal Reserve Board and most former Secretaries of the Treasury have argued that it is unwise and dangerous to let banks provide these broad financial services within the structure of the bank itself; that they should be required to separate securities, separate insurance, separate these other industries from the capital of the bank itself because the bank is insured by the American taxpayer. So the first argument is a safety and soundness argument. The second argument is that the implicit subsidies to banks will give them an unfair advantage in providing these services if they are allowed to do them within the bank. 
   I just want to read a couple of quotes from Alan Greenspan. This is Alan Greenspan in his April 28 testimony before the House Commerce Committee. ``I and my colleagues''--and by ``colleagues'' he means every member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board. I want to remind our colleagues, meaning Senators, that most of those members of the Federal Reserve Board were appointed by Bill Clinton, by this President. Chairman Greenspan said:  
   I and my colleagues accordingly are firmly of the view that the long-term stability of U.S. financial markets and the interest of the American taxpayer would be better served by no financial services modernization bill, rather than one that allows the proposed new activities to be conducted by the bank as proposed in H.R. 10.  
   And I would say in the Sarbanes-Daschle substitute. 
   In other words, every member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board says that for the safety of the taxpayer in FDIC insurance, and for the general competitiveness of the economy, if we had a choice between letting banks provide these broad services within the bank or having no bill at all, they unanimously would prefer having no bill rather than doing it the wrong way, as they concluded. 
   Greenspan goes on to say that allowing these services to be provided within the bank ``leads to greater risks for the deposit insurance funds and for the taxpayer.'' 
   Secondly, John Dingell, long-time chairman of the House Commerce Committee and, in the minds of many, the most influential Democrat in the House of Representatives, has said that, ``absent significant changes in H.R. 10''--that is, the House bill, and the same provisions are in the Sarbanes substitute--``that I will be compelled to oppose this bill with every bit of strength I have.'' 
   So this is a very important issue and an issue which we will vote on as part of the general substitute that will be voted on first, and then perhaps we will vote on again. 
   Let me turn to a discussion of CRA. Most people think of the Community Reinvestment Act as being a very small program. And it was a very small program until 1992. 
   In 1977, Senator Proxmire put a little provision in a housing bill that nominally required banks to make loans in the communities where they collected deposits. A North Carolina Democrat objected to the provision. There was a vote to strip it out of the bill, and the vote failed on a 7-7 tie. This so-called CRA provision went on to become the law of the country and became far more important than the bill to which it was attached. 
   Prior to 1992, if you added up all the CRA agreements and all the bank capital allocated by the CRA requirements, these provisions had allocated only about $42 billion worth of capital. 
   Today, 6 years later, CRA is allocating $694 billion in 1 year. That is loans, that is commitments to lend, and that is hard cash payments. To put this in perspective, that is bigger than the gross domestic product of Canada. It is bigger than the combined assets of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. It is bigger than the total discretionary Federal budget of the U.S. Government. 
   Especially troubling is the $9 billion of cash payments which have been made as part of CRA agreements. 
   In 1977, nobody ever contemplated that under a requirement of law which required banks to meet credit needs of the communities where they collected deposits that someday banks would pay out and commit $9 billion of cash payments as part of this process. 
   Let me explain these cash payments: As part of every CRA agreement we have been able to obtain, there is a requirement that the banks pay cash to individual protesters and protest groups, in return for which they generally sign an agreement that they will withdraw their objection to the banks taking the activity which they objected to. 
   Our provisions relating to CRA are very simple. Let me begin with the integrity provision. 
   Under current law--or under current practice, because the law is a very general law--it is possible for a protest group, say, in Boston to protest a bank merger in Illinois and, in essence, not go away until its ``expenses'' in a cash payment to it are made. 
   It has now become fairly common for protest groups from one State or region to protest bank actions in another State or region, entering into the process to file a complaint or to threaten a complaint. But often official complaints are not filed. You are going to hear figures about there being complaints in only 1 percent of the bank applications. Remember, most applications are only to close or open a branch. The big applications are merger applications, and one of the reasons we have had an explosion in 
   CRA and the cash payments in the last 6 years is from these mergers. 
   None of these agreements is public--every agreement we have seen, and we now have three that I have read, and we are getting more every day--every one of them requires the bank to keep the agreement private, so no one knows what percentage of the face value of the loan goes to the community group in a cash payment. No one knows how much in direct payments occurs. No one knows how much the community group collects in classes, say, that it makes the borrowers go to and then pay it cash money. 
   But basically our first amendment tries to deal with the following problem: The last-minute protest, or where the protester does not file with the Comptroller of the Currency but simply goes to the bank in question and says, ``Look, I'm going to file this complaint. Here is a letter that I'm going to send to the Comptroller of the Currency calling you a racist and calling you a loan shark. And these are the protests that I'm going to hold in these  various locations. And I wanted to see, before I did all this stuff, if you were willing to `comply' with the law.'' 
   Basically what is happening in these cases is, there is immense pressure on the bank to make a cash payment or to enter into some kind of agreement in order to be able to move forward on their merger. 
   Here is what our amendment says. If a bank has been in compliance with CRA--the bank has been evaluated by any of the Federal regulators who have jurisdiction to come to the bank, evaluate it, review its records, and determine that it is complying with CRA--if the bank has complied 3 years in a row, and if it is currently in compliance, then a protester is not precluded from protesting. You are going to hear some people say this is a safe harbor. It is not a safe harbor. Legally, it is a rebuttable presumption. 
   The bank is assumed to be in compliance if it has been in compliance three times in a row and is deemed by its regulators in compliance now, unless the protester or protest group can present substantial evidence of noncompliance. 
   Now, what does ``substantial evidence'' mean and where does the term come from? Substantial evidence is referenced 900 times in the United States Code. It is probably the best defined legal term in the American system of jurisprudence. There have been 400 major cases defining what substantial evidence means. 
   Title 5 of the United States Code relating to administrative law--that is, how agencies function--already requires that agency action be based upon substantial evidence, not on arbitrary or capricious action. So the reality is, it is already the law that bank regulators should be using this standard right now for evaluating CRA. In fact, all banking laws and procedures and the judicial review of all banking laws and all banking procedures use one standard--substantial evidence. 
   Now, what does substantial evidence mean? I have a good counsel, and she has gone back and researched all these 900 laws and all of these court rulings. Here is what substantial evidence means. In order for a protester to stop a bank merger or have its protest become a formal part of the consideration for a bank application, the protester must present substantial evidence that the bank is either not in compliance or won't be in compliance after its action. 
   Now, what does substantial evidence mean? It means ``more than a mere scintilla.'' In other words, you have a bank that is engaged in a transaction where it could literally lose $100 million a day by being unable to consummate its agreement, and the standard that we require for you as an individual to come in and throw a rock in the gear and potentially stop this whole process is that you have to present more than a mere scintilla of evidence that this bank, with a long history of compliance, where the regulators say it is in compliance right now, all you have to do is present more than a mere scintilla of evidence that in fact the bank is not in compliance. 
   Now, what is onerous about that? In fact, should we have a procedure in a free society where professional protesters, without presenting a mere scintilla of evidence, can literally hold up institutions and potentially impose hundreds of millions of dollars of costs on them and their customers without presenting a scintilla of evidence? Who could be against that proposal? 
   A second definition defined in case law and in statute is, such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might--it doesn't say ``has to''--accept as adequate to support a claim; real, material, not seeming or imaginary; considerable in amount, value, and worth. 
   So I ask my colleagues and anybody who might be interested in this debate, is it unreasonable for a bank which has historically been in compliance with the CRA law, has been meeting the requirements as judged by the regulators who have responsibility for judging, having been in compliance 3 years in a row, being in compliance now, if somebody wants to come in and prevent them from doing things which the regulator has already judged in their last evaluation that at least as of that point they were in compliance with the law to allow them to do that, is it unreasonable to ask that they present at least one scintilla of evidence, that they present evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a claim, that their evidence be real, material and not seeming or imaginary, or that it be considerable in amount, value, and worth? How could anyone think that standard is too high? 
   The second issue related to CRA has to do with small banks. Small banks in rural areas have a very small percentage of the capital that is available in the American banking system--about 2.7 percent. But I think of greater importance is the following figure, and I think it proves one thing conclusively: Small banks in communities that are outside metropolitan areas--that is, 
   generally don't even have a city much less an inner city--are doing an excellent job of serving their communities. 
   Since 1990, there have been 16,380 CRA exams on small, rural banks. Many of the small bankers from all over America who have written the Banking Committee have estimated that CRA compliance costs them about $60- to $80,000 a year. They have to name a CRA compliance officer. Many of these banks have between 6 and 10 employees. By the time they do all the paperwork and comply with all of the regulations, by the time they name a CRA compliance officer--normally that is the president of the bank--they are having to pay between $60- and $80,000 a year to comply. Sixteen thousand, three hundred and eighty of them have been examined for CRA compliance since 1990, and only three small rural banks and S&Ls have been deemed to be out of compliance. That is, 3/100 of 1 percent of the evaluations have turned up just three small banks and small S&Ls in rural areas that are out of compliance. 
   In return for having turned up 3 supposed bad actors, you have had 16,380 evaluations, 40 percent of the entire enforcement mechanism for CRA. What I do not understand is why CRA advocates don't want to take that enforcement and put it where the money is, in the urban areas and in the big banks. 
   I have numerous letters--and I will read some of them--from small bankers, several of whom have been Federal regulators enforcing these very laws in the past, outlining how hard it is for them to comply with these regulations and that they are already lending to everybody in town just to stay in business. These are very small communities, and they have a very small lending base. 
   Now, I have spent a lot of time going through these issues, but I think they are important issues. I look forward to debating this issue. I hope we can pass a good bill. I agree with Alan Greenspan and I agree with every one of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, however, on one point: It is better to have no bill than to have a bad bill. 
   I want a bill that is going to promote competition, not reduce it. I want a bill that is going to reduce regulation and redtape and cost, not increase it. I want a bill that is going to expand financial services, not reduce them. I want a bill that is going to lower the costs of financial services, not increase them. I believe we have such a bill before the Senate. 
   I hope my colleagues will listen very carefully to the debate. I hope they will enter it with open, not necessarily empty, minds. I think if they listen to the two major issues we are going to debate--and those issues are: Should banks provide these expanded services within a bank, or should they have to provide it outside the bank structure?--and as they listen to the issue about whether or not we want integrity and relevance in CRA, which has become, now, the largest program undertaken by the Federal Government, if measured against direct government spending. 
   It seems to me that the conclusions they will reach are obvious, and in reaching those conclusions we will have the additional benefit of passing a bill that will expand financial services and reduce costs. I thank my colleagues for their patience. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am going to yield to the Presiding Officer and come up and preside so he can give his opening statement, if he would like to do that. Before doing that, however, I will make a couple of points in response to Senator SARBANES' statement. 
   First of all, the substitute that Senator SARBANES will offer is not last year's bill. In fact, it is fundamentally different from last year's bill on the most important issue in financial services modernization. That issue is, should the modernization occur within the structure of the bank, or should it occur through the holding company? Last year's bill followed the proposal which has been made and supported by all of the members of the Federal Reserve Board and its Chairman, Alan Greenspan, whereas this bill----

   Mr. GRAMM. No. I am simply making sure that everybody understands--because there were a lot of references made between last year's bill and this year's bill--that how someone voted last year is interesting and may, to some extent, be relevant, but on the fundamental issue that is before us, whether or not these new services should be provided within the bank or outside the bank in holding companies, the substitute which the Senator will offer later today is a very different bill from last year's bill. That is the only point I am making. 
   The second thing I will make clear is, I didn't object to the growth in CRA and the commitments made to CRA. I did make the point, however, that when in a given year--in fact, last year--the loans, the commitments to lend, the cash payments, and the commitments to pay cash in the future are bigger than the Canadian economy, bigger than the discretionary budget of the Federal Government, perhaps it is time to look at potential abuses. 
   Now, granted, the Senator made the point that not every loan was made this year, and not every cash payment was made this year. I was simply using the data the way community groups presented it. I was very careful to say that the $694 billion was loans, commitments to lend, cash payments, commitments to pay cash in the future. I stand by those numbers, and those are the numbers of the community service groups.

   Mr. GRAMM. There will be more agreements next year and next year and next year. The point is, this has grown from a very small program into a very big program. I believe, and the majority of the members of the committee believe, it is time to look at this program and look at abuses, and we are going to have plenty of time to debate this later. 
   Let me also note that, under current law, a bank is not required to get CRA approval to sell insurance. Under current law, there are a limited number of banks that do have some insurance powers. They are not required under current law to get CRA approval to engage in those security powers. 
   Now, in terms of the CRA reforms in the bill reported by the Banking Committee, those reforms have been endorsed by the American Bankers Association, by the Bankers Roundtable, and by the Independent Bankers Association of America. When our colleague says everybody is happy with the provisions of his substitute, I want people to know that three major banking groups have endorsed 
   the provisions of our bill. 
   Let me say again--and I don't know what you do to get people to use the English language--there is not a safe harbor in this bill. A safe harbor is where something can't be challenged. There is a rebuttable presumption in the bill. There is a big difference between the two. The rebuttable presumption in the bill simply says that in order to stop or delay a regulatory action, you have to present substantial evidence. That substantial evidence is defined in law as more than a scintilla. It is defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a claim. 
   That is not a safe harbor. That simply is giving the evaluation that has occurred some standing. 
   Our colleague talks about comments. Nothing in the bill prevents anybody from commenting on any CRA evaluation. Comments can be made. People can submit any comments. All our provision says is, if a bank has been in compliance for 3 years in a row, if they are currently in compliance in their evaluation with CRA, if the regulator is going to stop the process or delay it, they have to have more than a scintilla of evidence. In order for the protest or objection to be used to stop the process for a bank with a long history of compliance, there has to be substantial evidence. People can comment all they want to comment. Nothing in this provision prevents comments. 
   Finally--and we will have lots of time to debate these--in terms of unitary thrifts, unitary thrift holding companies are not a loophole. Congress legislated them. We end them in saying that you cannot do any more, but to suggest that they are a loophole, an accident, that nobody ever intended they come into existence, they have existed for over 30 years. We are not debating here whether or not we should stop the issue of new licenses to commercial interests to create ``new unitary thrifts.'' The question is, What do you do with people who already have the charters? Do you change the rules of the game on them? 
   If our colleagues would indulge me, I yield to Senator ENZI.

   Mr. GRAMM. I have to accommodate our dear colleague from Minnesota. Let me say, I wish he could go on forever, because I am always enlightened listening to him. But to accommodate him, I asked unanimous consent that he might have 40 minutes when we came back in at 2:15. It is now 3:15. The Senator has spoken an hour. 
   I asked other people to come over to speak based on that agreement. I do not intend to try to enforce the 40 minutes, but if the Senator could take that into account, because I asked Senator BENNETT, who, as are all of us, is busy, to come over based on that agreement. He has been sitting here now for 25 minutes or so. If the Senator could sort of begin to bring it to a close, it would be much appreciated.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me thank our dear colleague from Utah for his very fine comments. Any colleagues who want an opportunity to speak on the bill should come to the floor to be afforded that opportunity. At some point, if we don't have people over to speak on the bill, Senator SARBANES, under the unanimous consent request, will offer his substitute. Members can wait and speak on that substitute, if the Senator chooses to offer it, and obviously if you want to speak about the bill itself, you can do it on the substitute. Members desiring to speak on the bill before the substitute is pending, should come on over. 
   Mr. President, I will respond very briefly to our dear colleague, Senator WELLSTONE. Senator WELLSTONE gave an impassioned plea not to repeal CRA. Let me say that one of my great frustrations with our efforts to reform CRA and curb abuses in CRA is that nobody wants to debate the reforms. Even the spokesman for the national association of the community groups that form the heart of CRA has said what they call ``green mail'' exists. They think it is harmful to CRA. Most Americans would call that process ``blackmail'' and not ``green mail.'' 
   I think many people have had at least their eyebrows raised by the fact that $9 billion in cash payments have been made or committed under CRA. CRA is not about giving people money not to testify against your bank merger, or to testify for it; instead, CRA is about giving people an opportunity to have input and present evidence as to whether they are meeting the requirements of the law. 
   I don't know what any judicial process--and this is a quasi-judicial process, I guess you could say--how anyone would not be revolted by the practice of paying witnesses. In essence, as Members will see when we begin the debate on CRA and we show some of the documents with the names redacted, that is exactly what is happening all over America today. 
   The point I make about CRA is no one is talking about repealing CRA. This is not a debate about repealing or weakening CRA. This is a debate about integrity of banks that have longstanding records of compliance, and whether somebody just by calling them a name--by saying they are a loan shark, they are a racist, or some other inflammatory name--should be able to delay actions that they are guaranteed on an impartial basis under the law. 
   All our provision in the bill says is that if a bank is going to be denied the ability to do something that they would have to be in CRA compliance for, and they have a long history of being in compliance on CRA, then those people who object--for their objection to be used to delay the process--have to present substantial evidence. 
   Now, ``substantial evidence'' is defined in law more precisely than any other term of art in the American legal system: more than a scintilla of evidence; facts that would lead a reasonable person to think that something might be true. 
   We are talking about the lowest standard of law, not the highest standard. 
   The second provision in out bill would allow very small banks in rural areas that don't have a city to serve, much less an inner city, to be exempt from a regulatory burden that costs them between $60,000 and $80,000 a year, even though these banks generally have only between 6 and 10 employees. Since 1990, in 16,000 audits of these small, rural banks, only three banks have been found to be in substantial noncompliance. 
   Every word that the Senator said about not repealing CRA I am sure resonated, but it doesn't have anything to do with the debate we are having. Nobody is proposing we repeal CRA in this bill. We are talking about two targeted reforms. I don't want anybody to get confused.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me talk about simplicity and clarity in the two bills. I know that seldom in writing laws do we hear lawmakers talk about what makes sense and what is simple and what is readable. 
   I begin by asking people to look at the bill adopted by the Senate Banking Committee modernizing financial services. That bill is 150 pages long. The substitute which has been offered by Senator SARBANES is 349 pages long. Members might ask, What is the extra 200 pages for? The extra 200 pages is for a convoluted process that breaks the simplicity of the bill adopted by the Banking Committee. 
   What is very good about our bill is, it is very easy to understand. If a securities firm wants to set up a bank holding company and engage in securities activities, banking activities, and insurance activities, it can set up a bank holding company, and outside the bank it can be involved in insurance and securities and it can be involved in banking under the bank holding company. 
   It is a very simple organization. It is an organization that provides any one of the three financial industries to become bank holding companies and participate in providing a broad array of services, including banking services. And it is an organization that is very easy to understand. It is an organization that you can set out in 150 pages with all the whistles and bells and all the icing on the cake. 
   The Sarbanes substitute is 200 pages more complicated, and it is more complicated because it goes about things in a very different way. You can have a bank holding company that can be in the banking business and in the securities business under the basic framework of the bank. You can have a financial services holding company, a totally new entity, and it can have an insurance company, a bank holding company, and a securities firm. And under the bank holding company, you can have a bank, and that bank can be in the securities business, and it creates another totally new entity, a wholesale financial holding company, and it can be in the insurance business, wholesale financial institution business, and securities firms. Finally, banks can be in the securities business. 
   So the first argument I want to make is based on simplicity--not that anybody ever gauged a Federal law based on, ``Does it make sense, is it simple, could people actually employ it, what kind of roadmap is it for the development of new financial institutions in America?'' But the reason our bill can do what it sets out to do in 150 pages, and the reason the substitute takes 300 pages, is the underlying bill adopted by the Banking Committee has a simple structure that everybody can understand and that securities firms, banks, and insurance companies could all participate in. Under our bill, it is easy for any one of the three to set up a bank holding company. 
   The substitute is a lot more complicated and brings in a lot of new institutions. It would be very hard, in terms of a user-friendly roadmap, as to how to do this. I do not know that sways anybody in the private sector or in any real world activity. But simplicity, and the sort of clear approach that people can follow--if they are buying a roadmap or if they are buying a computer program--is an important thing. Unfortunately, it is not something that is often mentioned in making the law of the land; but, quite frankly, it should be. 
   I am going to try to take less time in responding than I did in my opening statement on this. I want to break the proposal into eight areas and discuss the proposal in that way. There are eight key ways that this substitute is fundamentally different from the bill which was adopted by the Banking Committee and which is before us. 
   The first and most important difference is that the substitute before us--offered by Senator SARBANES, which is different from the bill that Senator SARBANES supported last year, different from the bill that was adopted by the Banking Committee last year, and far different from the bill that is before the Senate now--allows banks to engage in broad financial services within the legal framework of the bank. 
   Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, has said--and I want to read this quote because I think it is important. I think, No. 1, everybody in America takes Alan Greenspan seriously. Second, I want to remind people that the majority of the Governors of the Federal Reserve Board were appointed by this President, Bill Clinton. This is a statement that Chairman Greenspan made just last week before the House Commerce Committee in opposition to exactly the proposal which is the heart of the Sarbanes substitute. When Chairman Greenspan refers to ``colleagues,'' he means every member of the Federal Reserve Board, including those appointed by Bill Clinton:  
   I and my colleagues are firmly convinced of the view that the long-term stability of U.S. financial markets and the interests 
   of the American taxpayer would be better served by no financial modernization bill rather than one that allows the proposed new activities to be conducted by the bank....... 
   I want to be sure everybody understands this quote. It is as clear as you can be clear. The most respected economic mind in America, the man who more than any other person on this planet has been responsible for the financial stability that has created over 20 million jobs and enriched working Americans by driving up equity values and by creating unparalleled prosperity in America, said last week that he and every member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve believe it would be better to have no financial services modernization bill than to adopt the Sarbanes substitute. 
   That is pretty clear. I think it is a profound position to take. Let me make the point: Everybody who knows Alan Greenspan knows that Alan  Greenspan goes out of his way not to be confrontational. Everybody who knows Chairman Greenspan knows that if there is a way of saying something around the barn, something which might be offensive to somebody, he sort of walks all the way around the barn and let's you understand--where you can hope nobody else understands--that he said your idea is a bad idea. That is the way Alan Greenspan works. 
   But in front of God and everybody at the House Commerce Committee last week, Alan Greenspan said if the alternative is the Sarbanes substitute or no bill, he and every member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve are convinced that ``no bill'' is better than the Sarbanes substitute. 
   Why does he say this? In a dozen other quotes, he basically says two things: No. 1, since we have deposit insurance, where the taxpayer is on the hook for bank failures that threaten insured deposits, he is concerned that allowing banks to get into these other kinds of financial businesses within the framework of the bank itself endangers deposit insurance and threatens the taxpayer. So the first reason that Chairman Greenspan made this extraordinary statement--in fact, the strongest statement he has made as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve--is concern about the insurance fund and the taxpayer being on the hook. 
   The second concern is that if banks provide these expanded activities, such as securities and insurance or whatever activities are ultimately allowed within banks, the subsidy that banks have in deposit insurance--something no other institution has besides banks, S&Ls, and other institutions that have Federal guarantees, and when I am saying banks I mean broadly defined--plus the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve at the lowest interest rates at which anybody in the world borrows, and the ability to use the Fed wire, where they can wire money that instantly becomes bank reserves and it is guaranteed by the Federal Reserve bank, Chairman Greenspan and the Federal Reserve have estimated that if banks were allowed to provide these services within the bank, they probably have an effective subsidy of around 14 basis points. And this subsidy is due to the access to these three items: Deposit insurance, the Fed window, the Fed wire. 
   Chairman Greenspan has explained to anybody who would listen that if you let banks perform these services within the banking structure itself, banks will have an advantage over those who are providing securities services and selling securities outside of banks; that if you allowed banks to do insurance within the bank, they would have an advantage over insurance companies that are not banks. 
   Chairman Greenspan has tried to alert us to the fact that if we adopted the Sarbanes substitute we could literally, within 10 or 20 years, have a financial system where virtually all of the securities activities and all of the insurance activities, if banks were allowed to do insurance within the bank itself, would be dominated by a handful of big banks. In other words, our economy would look very much like the Japanese economy, in terms of its financial structure. 
   Chairman Greenspan says, if your choice is no bill or doing what the Sarbanes substitute wants to do, for safety and soundness reasons, for the protection of the taxpayer, for the protection of competition, for the protection of the competitiveness of the American economy, Chairman Greenspan says: Kill the bill before you do what the Sarbanes substitute would do, in terms of letting banks in these other lines of financial services within the structure of the bank. 
   Chairman Greenspan said let banks do these things--let them sell insurance, let them provide securities services--but make banks do them outside the bank where they have to take capital out of the bank to capitalize these companies and where they compete with nonbanks on an equal footing. 
   This is a critically important issue, and it is an incredible paradox, an absolutely astounding paradox that Senator SARBANES, who supported Chairman Greenspan's position in the bill last year, is now taking exactly the opposite position. It is my understanding that perhaps all the Democrat Members of the Senate may be inclined to take this position, a position that many of them, perhaps two out of every three, would have opposed as any kind of freestanding measure. I hope that is not the case, but perhaps it is. 
   If for no other reason, if you do not have 101 other reasons to vote against the Sarbanes substitute, listen to Alan Greenspan: Spare the taxpayer, spare deposit insurance, and spare the economy by rejecting this proposal. 
   The pending substitute dramatically expands CRA. It dramatically expands CRA in several ways. For the first time in the history of CRA, the Sarbanes substitute provides that financial institutions that fall out of compliance with CRA will now be deemed to be in violation of banking law and, therefore, potentially subject to fines of up to $1 million a day. 
   Let me remind those who do not follow these issues--and why would you unless you are in this line of work?--currently under the Community Reinvestment Act, while banks are evaluated every year and while banks take a legitimate pride in getting good scores on their evaluations, they are not required to be in compliance. The only time CRA imposes a ``penalty'' is if a bank wants to take an action that requires CRA evaluation--such as the opening or closing of a branch, or selling or buying a bank, or merging with another bank. 
   The Sarbanes substitute would vastly expand CRA by making it a violation of Federal banking law simply to be out of compliance with CRA and, in the process, potentially subject not just the bank, but an individual bank officer and an individual board member, to a fine of $1 million a day. 
   The Independent Community Bankers of America sent a letter today raising a very important issue. Little banks have trouble getting people of substance to serve on their bank boards. It is hard because there are liability issues involved, and one of the big struggles that little banks have is getting city leaders to be on the bank board. We want the best people to serve on bank boards because they are the people who ultimately make decisions that affect safety and soundness, that affect the well-being of the depositor, that affect lending policy, and that affect the taxpayer through Federal deposit insurance. 
   I want you to listen to the president of the Independent Community Bankers of America. This is an organization that represents small, independent banks all over America. Listen to 
   this paragraph:  
   We also have grave concerns about expanding CRA enforcement authority to include the levying of heavy fines and penalties against banks or their officers and directors. An ongoing challenge for many community banks in small communities is finding willing and qualified bank directors. Legislation following the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s greatly increased the amount of civil monetary penalties to which bank officers and directors may be subject. Any increase in the potential for fines and penalties could provide further disincentive for serving on a bank board.  
   All Members should realize that this does not apply just to small banks, it applies to big banks. If you had a bank with 200 branches and just one branch fell out of compliance, you could potentially be subjected to this fine. This is regulatory overkill. This is totally unjustified. 
   Our colleague, Senator SARBANES, says we have not presented enough data about abuses. Where is the abuse that could possibly call for such a provision? This is punitive legislation at its worst, and if you think we have a problem now with community groups intervening and demanding cash payments, you add to it a possibility that a bank officer or board member could be fined $1 million a day and you are going to multiply the abuse a thousandfold. This is a proposal which was clearly written, and I can tell you where and when, when there was a desperate effort in the House to get their bill passed last year. It passed by one vote, and they basically gave this provision to groups that wanted to massively expand CRA. That is how it got into this whole debate. 
   I cannot believe anybody seriously would want to subject bank officers and bank directors to a potential $1-million-a-day fine for temporarily falling out of compliance with CRA. 
   The Sarbanes substitute expands CRA by requiring CRA compliance to  engage in new financial activities, including insurance and securities. No CRA test is now required for such banking activities. 
   Here is the whole issue. Today, some banks do sell insurance. Today, some 20 banks engage in securities activities, and virtually every bank, through their holding company, engages in activities which, under the Sarbanes substitute, would be pushed out of the trust department and into an affiliate or an operating sub and, therefore, would subject that bank to this new regulation. 
   The point is, current law does not require a bank to get CRA approval to sell insurance. Current law does not require a bank to get CRA approval to sell securities. This is, again, a massive expansion in CRA. And if the Senator is justified in questioning our justification for wanting to adopt two modest reforms of CRA, I think it is reasonable to ask what is the justification for this massive expansion in CRA. 
   Finally, on CRA, for the first time in American history, the Sarbanes substitute would expand CRA to a noninsured institution. The justification for CRA was that banks and other banking-type institutions, S&Ls, have deposit insurance. 
   And that is a subsidy to the bank. Therefore, asking the bank to provide these resources, on a broad basis, to the community or to allocate capital based on a Government dictate rather than the market had a justification. That was the justification for CRA. 
   The SARBANES substitute would expand CRA coverage to a new institution, the wholesale financial institution, or WFI, which does not have FDIC insurance. This is a clear expansion of CRA beyond anything that has ever been enacted into law. In addition, the SARBANES substitute would repeal the two reform provisions that are in the bill. 
   I am not going to get into a long dissertation on this subject, because we are going to have an opportunity to debate this subject at length tomorrow--and believe me, I am ready to debate it--but I just want to make a couple points about the provisions that would be stricken by the SARBANES substitute. 
   First of all, our first provision is an integrity provision. Put simply, consider a bank that is in compliance and has been in continuing compliance with CRA for 3 years in a row, so that in the mind of the regulator, based on the information they have been presented--and any group in America can have an input into those evaluations--this bank is a good actor, they have a good record of compliance. 
   The SARBANES substitute would strike our provision that says that while anybody can present any information they want to the regulator--and the regulator can demand a new evaluation when the bank in question seeks, for example, to merge with another bank or sell or buy a bank--but unless the protesting group presents some substantial evidence that this bank is out of compliance--something that their regulators had said three times in a row they were not--unless they can present some substantial evidence, then based on that objection alone, the regulator cannot turn down the proposal or delay it. 
   I went through earlier today--and I hope people heard it and remember it--but I went through what ``substantial evidence'' means. The most important thing to remember about it is, the law already requires it. All banking law requires decisionmaking to be based on ``substantial evidence,'' and bars decisionmaking based on arbitrary and capricious action. All banking law currently requires it. All appeals of banking regulator decisions must be based on the absence of substantial evidence. 
   So really what we are trying to do here is force the regulator to comply with the normal administrative convention, which is, if somebody wants to enter a process--at the last moment, in this case--and demand that someone not be allowed to do something that they have earned a right to do, then they must present substantial evidence to show that they are not complying. 
   Senator SARBANES suggested that the evidence can only be on items which have occurred since the last evaluation. Not so. In fact, what our bill says is that the regulator may not delay or deny an application unless ``substantial verifiable information arising since the time of [the bank's] most recent examination under that Act demonstrating noncompliance is filed with the appropriate Federal [regulator].'' 
   Our provision provides that any new information may be presented. It is not something that has occurred since the last evaluation. It is something that the banking examiners did not have before when they said the bank was complying with the law. 
   I went through at great length the 900--I did not go through all 900 of them--but 900 times in Federal statutes we refer to ``substantial evidence.'' We have 400 court cases that have defined it. What does it mean? ``More than a scintilla of information,'' a factual basis under which a reasonable person might reach a conclusion--not that they would reach a conclusion, but that they might reach a conclusion. 
   So what Senator SARBANES is determined to kill is a simple proposal that certainly does not repeal CRA or overturn CRA or do 
   violence to CRA. All it says is, if a bank has a long record of being in compliance with CRA, if they are in compliance with CRA now, and they want to undertake an action that requires CRA evaluation, that if somebody wants to come in and object, they can say anything they want, they can present any information they want, but the regulator cannot overturn their established record unless the protester presents substantial information or data to back up their claim. 
   You might ask, why could anybody be opposed to that? Can you imagine that you have a bank which is trying to buy another bank, and they have been in compliance with CRA for three evaluations in a row and are currently in compliance, they have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake in consummating this agreement, a decision that can affect thousands of people, and you let one protester, who often is from not just another State but another region of the country--a protester from Brooklyn, NY--and he comes in and protests a bank merger in Illinois and will not go away until he gets his ``expenses paid'' and until he gets a cash payment? Now, under our provision, anybody can come in and protest, but in order for them to be able to stop the process, they have to provide substantial information. 
   I cannot understand how anybody can be opposed to that. 
   The second provision of our bill that would be overturned by the SARBANES substitute is the small bank exemption. Let me try to explain this, I think, in a way that everybody can understand. 
   I have two colleagues here. Let me say that I am sorry, but Senator SARBANES took an extended period of time to present this, and I have to go through and be sure it is responded to comprehensively. So I am probably going to talk for another half an hour or 45 minutes. If either one of my colleagues has just a few minutes, I will stop and let them speak. But I do not want them staying around here, standing up and thinking that I am about to finish. So with that, if either one of you just has an announcement you want to make or a unanimous consent request, I will yield. OK. 
   Here is the problem. You have little banks in rural areas. They have, most of them, between 6 and 10 employees. They are serving communities that do not even have a city, much less an inner city, and they are being forced to comply with this law called CRA. 
   It would be one thing if there were a record showing that these small, rural banks are not lending in their communities. But the plain truth is, as I pointed out earlier, since 1990 there have been 16,380 examinations conducted by bank regulators of small banks and S&Ls in rural areas, that is, outside standard metropolitan areas. And in those 16,380 examinations, only 3 rural banks have been found to be in substantial noncompliance. 
   These examinations and the regulatory burden imposed in complying with this law costs the average rural bank between $60- and $80,000. Imagine, you have a bank with 6 to 10 employees and they have to pay $80,000 to comply with a law that has found, since 1990, 3/100 of 1 percent of them out of compliance. 
   You might ask, is this overkill? It is interesting, because in other financial laws that relate to similar issues, we exempt banks outside standard metropolitan areas. In the HMDA statute related to similar areas, if you are very  small, you are exempt if you are outside a standard metropolitan area. And that is what we are talking in our provision--exempting very small banks in very rural areas. 
   Instead of my speaking for the problem, let me let the people who are affected speak. They are a lot more articulate on these issues than I am. Let me just run over some numbers with you. 
   We have received hundreds of letters from small banks all over America urging us to adopt the provision in this bill; we have received 488 as of today. What these small banks tell us is that CRA compliance is costing them between $60- and $80,000 a year. 
   The First National Bank of Seiling, OK, has estimated it takes the equivalent of one full-time employee to comply with CRA. The Chemical Bank of Big Rapids, MN--with assets of $94 million--agrees that it takes one full-time employee. Crosby State Bank of Crosby, TX, agrees with the one full-time employee. The First National Bank of Cortez, CO, thinks that they spend a minimum of 100 hours annually of CRA compliance officer time. 
   Let me read from some of the letters that have been submitted to the committee. I am only going to read from five or six of them, but I think they tell the story. 
   The first letter is from the Cattle National Bank. The Cattle National Bank, for those of you who don't know, and you should, is in Seward, NE. Here is what the vice president and cashier of the Cattle National Bank in Seward, NE, says:  
   Let me add that since the origination of public disclosure of CRA examinations we have not had one person from our community ever request the information. The only requests that we have had have come from bank consultants wanting to glean some tidbit from our disclosure.  
   This is a letter from Copiah Bank, which is a national bank in Crystal Springs, MS. This is written by the president and chief executive officer.  
   Our Compliance Officer, Gary Broome, and his assistant have spent many research hours and reams of paper in their efforts to comply with the mandated requirement's paper work. We have even had to outsource some of its checkpoints to a compliance consultant from time to time. As an $83 million community bank.......that means they probably have 6 or 7 employees.......we feel an obligation to help in your efforts toward easing our paper work burden.  
   Lakeside State Bank, ND.  
   As a former bank examiner for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which included consumer compliance experience, and as a banker for over 15 years I believe I have a good understanding of the intent and the workings of CRA. Over 47 years of our existence we have provided financing to virtually every main street business in our town, our customer base includes approximately 80 percent of the area farms and for the last several years over 50 percent of our loans have been to American Indians. The law--  
   And he means CRA.  
   .....is a heavy burden because of the expansiveness of the regulations and the paper requirements of compliance. We spend hours documenting what we have already done rather than spending that time more efficiently by doing more for our community.  
   This is from Farmers and Merchants Bank, and this is in Arnett, OK, written by the executive vice president and CEO.  
   I am the CEO as well as the chief loan officer, compliance officer and CRA officer. I have to wear so many hats because we are small and have a staff of only 7 including myself. CRA compliance, done correctly, takes a lot of time, which takes me away from my primary responsibility of loaning money to my community. It has almost gotten to the point that lending is a secondary function. It seems like we have the choice of lending to our community or writing up CRA plans showing how we would lend to the community if we had time to make the loans.  
   It is funny how wisdom just leaps off the page.  
   Large banks can hire full time CRA officers and other compliance personnel to administer CRA programs, but small banks cannot......  
   This is from the Redlands Centennial Bank, and it is in Redlands, CA.  
   We spent approximately $80 thousand dollars of our shareholders' money last year supporting this ill-defined regulation. Even the regulators who examined us were hard pressed to give us specific definitions on how we might better implement this regulation. I am urging you to get rid of this nonsensical CRA yoke. Keep up the fight, because there are a lot of us out here who are too busy balancing making a living with government regulations in this crazy business......  
   Chemical Bank North, which is a little bank in Grayling, MI. It is a $74 million bank, which means it probably has 6 to 10 employees.  
   As it is, we must devote disproportionate resources to creating and maintaining the ``paper trail'' that the current CRA regulations require. Our board members must attend time consuming CRA Committee meetings and our officers and staff members spend significant valuable time preparing reports and keeping records that serve no purpose other than to keep us in compliance with a regulation that attempts to enforce from a regulatory standpoint what we do everyday in the normal course of our business.......I would estimate that we devote the equivalent of a full time employee to all aspects of CRA compliance.  
   I mean, does anybody care that, for this little bank, that one-tenth of their payroll is needed to comply with a government regulation that in 9 years, in 16,000 such audits, has found only 3 banks substantially out of compliance? In 9 years, in 16,000 audits of banks like the Chemical Bank in Grayling, MI, government regulators have found only 3 banks out of the 16,000 evaluations where there was substantial noncompliance. 
   And yet, we are making these banks pay $80,000 a year. Does anybody care? You know, we talk about the little guy and why aren't we here debating this and that. Does anybody care that a little bank, trying to serve consumers in a small town, a little independent bank in an era when a lot of people are worried about all the banks being taken over by big banks, here is a little bitty bank trying to stay in business, and 1 out of every 10 people they employ--because they only employ 10--has to spend time complying with one regulation, which, over 9 years, in 16,000 audits, has found 3 violators? Yet, our colleague, Senator SARBANES, is so outraged that we would lift this paperwork burden that he has offered a substitute. I don't understand it. I don't understand it. But I don't guess I have to understand it. 
   First National Bank, founded in 1876, in Wamego, KS, spelled W-A-M-E-G-O. I ask the Chair, am I pronouncing it right?

   Mr. GRAMM. The occupant of the Chair knows because he knows and loves everybody that lives in that State, and I appreciate that. Wamego, KS. This is a little bitty bank, the First National Bank of Wamego, KS, founded in 1876. In other words, it has been in business for 123 years. How big do you think it is after 123 years of service? They have $65 million in assets, and it is the lifeblood of Wamego, KS. It is struggling with paperwork. It is a small bank and has 6 to 10 employees. People in that town are proud they have a bank. In a lot of towns that size, the bank has already gone broke and moved off to the big city. This bank has not deserted its customer base. They are trying to make a living. Let me read to you from their letter:  
   Our bank was listed 2 years in a row as the best bank in Kansas to obtain loans for small businesses by Entrepreneur Magazine.  
   They have received an outstanding rating under CRA--the best rating you can get.  
   Our outstanding grade did not make us a better bank. CRA did not make us make more loans than we would have made. CRA did take a lot of employee time to document that we were an outstanding bank.  
   Here is the point. This is a little bank that has been doing the job for 123 years. It only has $65 million in assets. This is a very small bank. It probably does not have 10 employees. It has been evaluated as being outstanding. But in 16,000 evaluations over the last 9 years, bank regulators nationwide found only 3 banks that were in substantial noncompliance. Why are we tormenting this little bank in Wamego, KS, which is doing a great job, and imposing $60,000 to $80,000 in costs on them to discover that only 3 banks out of 16,000 evaluations aren't doing a good job? 
   The next letter is from Nebraska National Bank, which is in Kearney, NE. They have $34 million in assets. This has to be one of the smallest banks in America. It has been in business for an extended period of time. I don't know how many employees they have, but I would guess five or six employees in the whole bank:  
   We do not make foreign loans. We don't speculate in derivatives. We don't siphon deposits from this area to fund loans elsewhere. Instead, like virtually all banks  under $250 million in assets [remember, they are only $34 million in assets], we provide home loans, business loans, farm loans, construction loans. We don't do this because of the Community Reinvestment Act, but because it makes good business sense. I bitterly resent every minute of my time and that of my staff spent to comply with this regulation because it takes time away from productive duties. I feel the regulation is now being used by consumer activist groups to shake down banks seeking regulatory approval for expansion of mergers.  
   Now, that is a strong testament. Nothing I could say could 
   give a stronger testament than that. 
   Let me give you one final one. Like I said, we have 488 just like it. They don't understand why it is unreasonable to lift this heavy regulatory burden when only 3 substantial noncompliant banks have been discovered in 9 years after 16,000 audits. You take 16,000 audits at $80,000 apiece, for the banks, that is a lot of money for these little towns. 
   The last letter is from American State Bank, an independent bank in Portland, OR. It is signed by the chairman and the CEO:  
   As one of the oldest and most strongly capitalized African American owned banks west of the Mississippi River, Portland based American State Bank supports your position on CRA exemption for nonmetropolitan banks. We also urge you to explore exempting from CRA requirements minority-owned commercial banks. Today, minority-owned banks still maintain their focus on serving our Nation's minority communities and their citizens. It is redundant at best to impose CRA requirements on banks whose sole purpose is to serve minority citizens. At worst, it compels minority banks to sustain burdensome, expensive administrative costs and subjects banks to a bureaucracy largely unaware of the realities of the inner-city marketplace.  
   Now, I could go on and on, Mr. President, in outlining the arguments related to small banks, but let me stop there on this issue and go back to the other provisions of the bill. 
   Let me say to my colleague that to go through and respond to each of the points Senator SARBANES made is probably going to take me another half hour. If the Senator has a unanimous consent request, or a short statement, I would be glad to yield. But if not, I want him and others to know that I should be finished maybe by 7 o'clock.

   Mr. GRAMM. It was my hope tonight that we could finish debate on this amendment, and that we would have a vote tomorrow. Our problem, as you know, is that we have the two Senators from Oklahoma who have flown home to participate in the evaluation and assistance with the terrible tragedy that happened there with the tornadoes. We are hopeful that they are going to be back tonight or in the morning. Then we are going to have a vote on Senator BYRD's resolution commending the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and other clergy leaders who participated in his trip. That vote is going to occur in the morning; I am not sure exactly what time. But the idea would be to have that vote in the morning and then, at that point, either I or the majority leader would move to table the amendment and we would have a vote on it. We would then offer one of our amendments at that point.

   Mr. GRAMM. I would assume we will have a debate in the morning and that we will probably have at least a half an hour on each side. I see nothing unreasonable about having time in the morning. I would strongly suggest that we do it. Any Member can object to any unanimous consent request. Otherwise, if the Senator wishes to have time, we will divide the time equally tomorrow. I don't see any reason why he couldn't have a chance to speak tomorrow.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me just touch on four more issues in the Sarbanes substitute that I take strong issue with. I see Senator GORTON is here and he wanted to say something. 
   The next concern that I have and that the majority has with the Sarbanes substitute is that it adopts security law revisions making it significantly more difficult for small banks to engage in trust and fiduciary activities. These activities currently make up about 15 to 20 percent of the revenues of small banks. 
   Here is the problem. Our bill goes to great lengths to say to some small bank in some small town that doesn't intend to get into financial services, that nothing in this bill is going to force them to take their trust department activities that they are now engaged in and either set up an operating subsidiary or set up an affiliate. 
   I believe the provisions of the Sarbanes substitute could adversely affect virtually every small bank in America and endanger the operations that they currently can do within a bank only under regulation by the bank in the name of trust department activities. I believe the provision offered by Senator SARBANES could force many of these banks to set up operating subsidiaries, or set up affiliates, and in the process drive up their costs and threaten their revenues. 
   Now we come to the so-called unitary thrift holding company. If you listen to Senator SARBANES, you get the idea that somehow we are expanding commercial activities of banks. The reality is that the Sarbanes substitute, by allowing banks to hold a commercial basket for 15 years, expands commercial activities of banks substantially more than our bill does. 
   Our bill restricts the ability of commercial companies--an 
   ability they have under current law--our bill restricts their ability to apply for charters and to set up a unitary thrift. 
   Unitary thrifts are legal under current law. So, for example, General Motors can get an S&L charter and can go into the S&L or banking business through that charter. That is the law of the land today. As a result, a substantial number of commercial companies have gotten those charters. 
   Our bill ends that practice. And effective on the day that the underlying committee bill was released as a committee print, any application for a unitary thrift received after that date would not be acted upon. 
   The difference between the Sarbanes substitute and what we do is that, in addition, the Sarbanes substitute goes back and says that those unitary thrifts that already exist would have an ex post facto change in law that would limit their ability to sell their  thrift--which is a change in the regulations under which they set up or bought the charter. 
   I believe that this is a takings of property, that it violates the fifth amendment of the Constitution. In fact, we have recently had a Supreme Court ruling striking down another ex post facto law that Congress passed that took away provisions that were in contracts that banks--and in this case S&Ls--had negotiated with Federal S&L regulators. 
   So we create no new commercial powers. There is nothing in our bill that in any way expands the ability of banks to hold commercial assets, whereas the substitute will allow them to hold them for 15 years under a grandfather provision, a provision that is not in our bill. 
   I was somewhat stunned to hear the presentation by Senator SARBANES that we were expanding commercial powers when in reality his substitute has a 15-year grandfather for existing activities, a provision that our bill does not have. Our bill not only does not expand commercial activities but it cuts off the issue of new unitary thrift licenses. But we do not go back and change the rules of the game on S&Ls that invested good money, many of them during the S&L crisis, saving the taxpayer billions of dollars. We don't go back and change the rules of the game on them. 
   I talked about No. 7. That is the commercial basket issue. The substitute offered by Senator SARBANES allows commercial banks to hold these commercial assets for up to 15 years. There is no similar provision in our bill. 
   Finally, the Sarbanes substitute strips away power from State insurance regulators. Under the Sarbanes substitute, States could only collect information but could not act on information, nullifying the authority of State insurance commissioners to review and approve or disapprove applications. 
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners opposes this provision. 
   So basically those are the differences. I think the differences are very clear and very stark. I hope my colleagues will look at them and will reject this substitute. 
   This substitute would create a bill that Alan Greenspan and every member of the Federal Reserve Board, speaking as a body through the Chairman, has said would be worse, in terms of danger to the taxpayers, danger to the insurance fund, danger to the economy, than passing no bill at all. 
   This bill would repeal two very simple, very targeted, very minor reforms of CRA, and would institute the most massive expansion of CRA in America history. 
   I think if people look at any one of these eight areas that I have outlined, they will conclude that the committee acted properly in rejecting the Sarbanes substitute. But the Sarbanes substitute wasn't rejected just because it was deficient in, say, five of these eight areas. It was rejected because in each and every one of these areas it was inferior--in terms of the well-being of the taxpayer, the well-being of the depository insurance system, the well-being of the economy--to the underlying bill that was adopted by the Banking Committee. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this substitute. There will be a tabling motion tomorrow on some basis yet to be agreed to. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, along with Senators KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, CONNIE MACK, and PAUL COVERDELL, I am introducing legislation today which will expand the opportunities for military retirees to use their Medicare coverage to pay for treatment at military medical facilities. By giving our military retirees this option, we fulfill a health care promise that America has made to every man and woman who has retired from our armed forces after a career of exemplary service. 
   Upon retirement after twenty or more years of military service, our nation promises to provide military health care to our retirees for the rest of their lives. This promise is one of the most important commitments our country makes to its military retirees. Unfortunately, for many military retirees age 65 and over, this promise is being broken. More and more of the 65 and over retirees have found themselves unable to receive care on a space-available basis at their local military medical facility. For these retirees, America's promise of health care for life is not being honored. 
   Ironically, many of these military retirees are entitled to Medicare in addition to their military health care eligibility. An estimated 1.2 million Americans fit into this ``dual-eligible'' category, with over 300,000 of them regularly using military medical treatment facilities for their health care. The result is that the Department of Defense effectively subsidizes Medicare at the rate of approximately $1.4 billion per year to treat these dual-eligible beneficiaries. 
   As a first step toward fulfilling America's promise to military retirees 65 and over, Congress passed my proposal for a three-year demonstration project as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Under this demonstration project, known as Medicare Subvention, over 28,000 dual-eligible military retirees are being treated in military facilities at selected test locations across the country. For these retirees, Medicare is reimbursing the Department of Defense up to 95% of the amount Medicare would pay Health Maintenance Organizations for similar care. Unfortunately, the limited scope of the demonstration project means that the majority of dual-eligible retirees are still unable to receive the treatment they have earned at the military facilities in their hometowns. 
   The bill we introduce today will keep the health care promise America made to her military retirees 65 and over by expanding the demonstration project and by ultimately making Medicare Subvention permanent across the country. Specifically, this bill will expand the test locations for the demonstration project to 16 sites effective January 1, 2000. At these 16 sites, the demonstration project will become permanent. In addition, on October 1, 2002, the bill expands Medicare Subvention to any military medical treatment facility approved by the secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank our colleague for clarifying that. 
   When our colleague says he doesn't get a chance to present his proposal--obviously, being in the majority, we have the opportunity to present bills and the majority leader has the right to offer amendments first. We have offered our proposal and we are trying to move toward the passage of a bill. But the amendment of the Senator would be in order if it was relevant to the underlying bill--actually, even if it were not relevant it would be in order--after we had completed action on the amendment by the majority leader. So that part of the argument simply will not hold water. But that makes it parallel to every other part of the argument, since none of it will hold water. 
   What our colleague has said and what we are hearing here is basically this: That a lockbox is a bad, terrible, destructive, dangerous idea that could cause a recession or a depression and be catastrophic for America. That is argument No. 1. But argument No. 2 is: If you want to do it, we have a better way of doing it and ours will do all these things better. 
   If logic could speak for itself on the floor of the Senate, it would scream at the torture that it is being put to here. What we are seeing here is very simply the President being called on a commitment he has made, and the President was not telling the truth when he made the commitment, and he desperately does not want to have to live up to it. Those are strong words and I would not say them if I could not back them up. 
   Here is the reality of where we are. In 1993 Social Security took in $45 billion more than it spent in benefits, and under the Clinton administration and the Congress every penny of that $45 billion was spent on something other than Social Security. 
   In 1994, Social Security took in $56 billion more than it paid out in benefits, and under the Clinton administration and the Congress every penny of that $56 billion was plundered and spent on something else. 
   In 1995, $62 billion was taken in in Social Security taxes above the amount  we needed to pay benefits, and every penny of that $62 billion was plundered and spent funding other Government programs. 
   In 1996, it was $67 billion that was plundered. 
   In 1997, it was $81 billion that was plundered. 
   In 1998, the President said, ``Save Social Security first; don't spend a penny of this surplus on Government programs; don't give a penny of it back in tax relief.'' Everybody remembers the President saying that. But in 1998, we spent $30 billion of the $99 billion that Social Security took in above the amount it needed to pay benefits. 
   The plain truth, despite all this talk about saving the Social Security trust fund, is we have consistently spent the money that came into the trust fund on other Government programs. 
   Let's get one thing clear from the language. Nobody is talking about saving Social Security here. To save Social Security, you have to have a program to replace all these IOUs with wealth. You have to have a program to replace all this debt with investment. 
   As you will remember, when the President said, ``Save Social Security first,'' he was going to study the problem for a year. He studied it for a year. Then he had a big meeting down at the White House, which I and many others here attended. We were waiting for some proposal from the President. What we got was a political copout which, for all practical purposes, did nothing and it continued plundering the Social Security trust fund. 
   Senator DOMENICI has come up with a very simple program. It has not saved Social Security. It does not deal with the huge financial liability in Social Security in the future. What it does is it tries to prevent us from taking the Social Security surplus and spending it on something else, something that many of our colleagues desperately want to do, but they do not want people to know they want to do it. 
   How does the Domenici proposal work and the proposal that has been refined by Senator ABRAHAM? What the Abraham-Domenici proposal does is this: It sets the amount of money that the Government can borrow each year so that the Social Security surplus has to be used to buy down the Government debt, so that the Social Security surplus cannot be spent, and so that it cannot be used for tax cuts. 
   The proposal before us is not very complicated, despite all the cloud of rhetoric and doublespeak. The proposal before us is very, very simple. It says that next year, we are going to be taking in $138 billion of surplus in Social Security, so that we want to set the amount of money the Government can borrow without having to vote on borrowing again, such that none of that $138 billion can be spent. 
   That is pretty simple. If it is spent, what we will have to do is have a vote in the Senate where someone will have to get 60 votes in order to plunder that money from Social Security. 
   This is not unlike what families do when they sit around the kitchen table and get out their pencil and on the back of an envelope and set out a budget and say: I want to save this much money, and we are setting this limit on the amount of money that we can spend because we want to use this money to pay off some of the debt we have, or we want to use this money to send our children to college or buy a new refrigerator, go on vacation, or whatever they want to do. 
   In response to our proposal to prevent the Social Security surplus from being spent or used for tax cuts, for that matter, since our colleague launched off on that program, what do our Democrat colleagues say, and what does the administration say? They say, if you do not leave the law as it is so we can plunder the Social Security surplus, we could have a recession. They say: If you don't allow us to plunder the Social Security surplus, the 
   creditworthiness of the Government could be lowered because we could have trouble borrowing money. In essence, they are saying that the financial world, the prosperity of America, the creditworthiness of the Federal Government will all come to an end if we do not let the Federal Government steal money from the Social Security surplus. 
   It seems to me if we are talking about the creditworthiness of the Government, in terms of its credibility with working Americans, that the way we get real credibility in the Government is to stop stealing the Social Security surplus. 
   In terms of the Secretary of the Treasury saying we are doing it the wrong way, the reality is, they do not want to do it any way. If they have a better proposal, let's see it. If it is enforceable, let's consider it. If they are willing to set out a procedure which strengthens our ability to stop stealing money from the Social Security trust fund, I would like to get a chance to look at it. 
   Let me tell you, the reality is that the opposition to the proposal by Senator ABRAHAM and Senator DOMENICI is, they do not want to stop stealing from the Social Security trust fund, so they create this giant ruse that somehow the Treasury will not be able to operate if it cannot take money out of the Social Security trust fund; that we are going to have a recession if we cannot take money out of the Social Security trust fund. Any legitimate concern about the flexibility of the Treasury in borrowing, we have said from the beginning we are willing to work on. Any flexibility they need in dealing with short-term cash problems, we are willing to work on. But what we are not willing to negotiate away is a commitment to stop this plundering of the Social Security trust fund. That is what this issue is about. 
   The President's budget this year, and I have the budget right here, if we do everything the President proposes to do, most of which we are not going to do, it says he will take $42 billion out of the Social Security trust fund this year and spend it on other things. We believe that is wrong. We do not believe the Social Security trust fund should be spent on other Government programs. 
   What we are trying to do with this lockbox is to guarantee that none of this Social Security money is spent and none of this Social Security money is used for tax cuts; that the money is used, until we decide how we are going to fix Social Security, to simply buy down the Government debt. 
   The amazing thing to me is that this is exactly what the President says he wants to do. It is exactly what our Democrat colleagues say they want to do. But when we try to put teeth in it and make it enforceable with a supermajority vote, suddenly they do not want to do it. Suddenly, when we try to make it enforceable, they say, ``Well, we could have a recession; the Federal Government could lose its creditworthiness and its ability to borrow.'' 
   What does it tell you when the President says, ``Save Social Security first, don't spend the surplus, don't give it back in taxes''; when our Democrat colleagues say, ``Save Social Security, don't spend the surplus, don't give it back in taxes''; and then we have two of our Members, Senator ABRAHAM and Senator DOMENICI, come forward with a proposal that actually does what they say they want to do, and not only does it, but would require 60 votes in the Senate, rather than 51, in order to actually violate the commitment. In other words, the difference here is, we are not talking about words, we are not talking about rhetoric, we are talking about a real lockbox program. 
   A real lockbox program is put forward that would require a supermajority vote in order to plunder the Social Security trust fund. Then, all of a sudden, the President does not want to do what he told us he wanted to do. 
   All of a sudden, our Democrat colleagues have all kinds of concerns: We are going to have a recession; we are going to destroy the creditworthiness of the Federal Government; prosperity as we know it is going to come to an end--if we stop the Federal Government from plundering the Social Security trust fund. It would lead one to believe that they did not mean it when they said it. 
   We are all in agreement if we say do not plunder the Social Security trust fund. If we held up our hands here, 100 Members would say do not plunder the Social Security trust fund. But when two Members come forward with a program to really prevent it from being plundered, then all of a sudden we do not agree anymore. I know these issues get confusing, but I think people are going to have to make a judgment here as to who is serious about protecting the Social Security surplus and who is not. 
   We have a proposal to stop the plundering of Social Security by simply requiring that the debt be bought down  by the amount of the surplus and that if you do not do that, you have to get 60 votes in the Senate; in other words, you have to prove that something extraordinary happened to convince 60 Members of the Senate to go back on their word. That is all this bill does. It is not complicated. 
   If you do not want to do that, it suggests to me that you were not serious to begin with, that you did not mean it when you said, ``Save Social Security first,'' that you did not mean it when you said, ``Don't plunder the Social Security trust fund.'' 
   We know the President did not mean it because in his budget he plunders $42 billion right here in black and white. The question is not, Was the President being straight with the American people? We know he was not. The question is, Is Congress being straight with the American people when we say we are not going to do it? 
   If our Democrat colleagues have a better way to do this, I would like to see it. I do not believe we have any monopoly on wisdom. But the plain truth is, I do not believe everybody wants to stop plundering the Social Security trust fund. I believe there are people who want to continue to plunder it. And I think that is what this debate is about. 
   Let me run over some of these issues. 
   ``It is risky to stop stealing from the Social Security trust fund.'' That is what our colleagues say. I think it is risky to continue to steal from the Social Security trust fund because when the baby boomers start to retire, unless we begin to invest this money, there is no way we can pay benefits, and we are going to have to raise the payroll tax or cut benefits. So our colleagues say it is risky not to steal the trust fund. I say it is risky to continue to steal it. 
   They say using the debt limit as a policy tool is dangerous. Well, what other tool do we have? They act as if we are just simply robots--that every time the President goes out and spends money, that when the bill collector is knocking on the door, all we do is just pay out the money and go on about our business. That is not the way America works. 
   When the bill collector comes and knocks on the door of the modest dwellings of working men and women in America, they do have to pay the bill collector. But they do not just keep merrily going along their way. They sit down, get out their credit cards, get out the butcher knives, cut up the credit cards, they write out a budget, they have a ``come to Jesus'' meeting at the kitchen table, and then they start again. 
   What we are trying to do in Government with this amendment is nothing less than what Joe and Sarah Brown do on the first day of the month every month that comes along; and that is, set out priorities and set some kind of limit on our spending. If we cannot use the debt collector being at the door to do something about spending and plundering the Social Security trust fund, what can we use? If you do not get alarmed when the bill collector is 
   knocking on your door, you are going to end up going bankrupt. Now is the time, when the bill collector is at the door, to try to change the way we are doing business. That is all this bill does. 
   As far as the suggestion that if we try to prevent stealing from the Social Security trust fund, we are going to have a recession, I mean, please, it is one thing to try to confuse people, it is another thing to insult their intelligence. How can reducing Government debt cause a recession? How can stopping stealing from the trust fund send the economy into a tailspin? Exactly the opposite is true. 
   Now then, the final bromide, unimaginable suggestion is, ``Well, what about Medicare? They are solving the Social Security problem, but they're not solving the Medicare problem.'' There are a lot of problems we are not solving here. This bill does not bring peace in Kosovo either. This bill does not stop violence in our schools either. This bill does not make people love their families and pay their bills either. This bill does not make people feel good about themselves in all cases either. But the bill does not claim to do all those things. 
   Why don't we solve the Social Security problem today, and then start working on Medicare? But to suggest that there is something wrong with this bill because it only stops plundering from Social Security and that we have not fixed the Medicare problem--we can always find something we have not done, but what we ought to be concerned about is what we are doing. 
   There is no surplus in the Medicare trust fund. Medicare is a very different program from Social Security. But I would like to say that on a bipartisan basis, led by Senator BREAUX, we had a bipartisan majority on a commission that wanted to fix Medicare; and this President, Bill Clinton, killed that effort--killed that effort. So to stand up here and suggest that when Senator ABRAHAM is trying to stop the stealing from Social Security, that there is something wrong because he had not solved the problems of Medicare is absolutely outrageous--outrageous. 
   Let's solve the problem with Social Security today, and start working on Medicare tomorrow. And, by the way, it seems to me that Senator BREAUX and Senator BOB KERREY and most Members who sit on this side of the aisle are ready to deal with Medicare and the President and most Members who sit on the other side of the aisle do not seem to care. 
   The next thing is, somehow this has to do with tax breaks for the rich. Our colleagues can never debate an issue without engaging in class warfare. They can never debate an issue without saying somehow this is helping the rich: ``If you stop stealing from the Social Security trust fund, you are helping the rich. If you let people keep more of what they earn, you are helping the rich.'' Of course, whenever they are raising taxes, they are taxing only the rich, even if the rich make $25,000 a year. 
   The point is, this bill has absolutely nothing to do with tax cuts for the rich, the poor, or the people in between. In fact, this bill says that the Social Security surplus cannot be used for tax cuts. And to suggest that somehow, by locking away the Social Security trust fund, and not letting it be plundered either to spend, which is the real danger, or to be used for tax cuts, that somehow to suggest that helps rich people, what it does is it helps the creditworthiness of the Government and it puts us in a position to fix Social Security. 
   But the idea that this somehow helps the wealthiest among us--anytime the Democrats do not want to do something, always their excuse is, the wealthiest among us are going to benefit. ``If we do not keep plundering the Social Security trust fund, the wealthiest among us are going to benefit. 
   If we can't steal that money and spend it on all these programs, the wealthiest among us are going to benefit. Let us keep stealing the Social Security trust fund because, if you don't keep stealing it, the wealthiest among us will benefit.'' 
   I do not know who these people are talking about. The wealthiest among us do not depend on Social Security as much as middle-income Americans depend on Social Security. What does this wealthiest among us business have to do with stealing from Social Security? 
   Finally, they say they have another way. It reminds me when we were debating a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and we were one vote short of sending it to the States. We know the States would have ratified it. Our colleagues who were against it and who voted against it and who killed it, they weren't really against it. They just didn't like the way we were doing it. They had other ways of doing it. They had a better program, which by the way contained a limit on debt held by the public, the very mechanism contained in this amendment. They would have done it better than we would have done it. They killed the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It failed by one vote. It could have changed American history. 
   They didn't say they were against it. They are not against the lockbox. They are not against what Senator ABRAHAM is trying to do. They just want to do it differently. They think it is a bad idea and it could cause a recession and it could help the wealthiest among us and it could do all those things, but they want to do it. If you decide you want to do it after they tell you what a terrible idea it is to quit stealing from Social Security, after you have crossed that  threshold, then they say, well, actually we are not against it, but we want to do it a different way. If we took their way, they would be for doing it another way. 
   The problem is, they are not for it. The problem is, they want to keep stealing this money out of the Social Security trust fund. That is what this debate is about. 
   The sadness of this whole deal is that instead of debating a legitimate issue, we are engaged in this gigantic ruse to confuse and befuddle the American people. We have a proposal before us that is very simple. It says we are going to collect $138 billion more than we are spending in Social Security, and we do not want any of that money spent. So we are going to adjust the amount of money Government can borrow and force that $138 billion to be used to reduce the indebtedness of the Federal Government. That is what this amendment does. 
   But rather than our colleagues standing up and saying, no, we do not want to do that because we want to spend part of that money on other things, instead of standing up and saying, here is what we want to spend it on, we want to spend it on A, B, C, D, and E, and these are all vitally important and it is worth stealing the money from the Social Security trust fund to fund it, rather than standing up and saying that, they say you are going to cause a recession. You are going to destroy the creditworthiness of the Federal Government. You are going to help the richest among us. The richest among us are going to benefit if you don't steal from the Social Security trust fund. 
   Maybe the American people are confused or maybe with all the terrible things that are happening in the world today, maybe they do not care. But it seems to me that we can't have a meaningful political dialogue when we do not debate the issues that are before us. If you are not for preventing the Social Security trust fund from being spent for other things, stand up and say it. But this tortured logic that if you really force the money to be used to buy down the debt of the Federal Government, you are risking a recession or you are helping the richest among us or that if you decide to get through all that, well, but there is a better way to do it, they could do it in a better way if we just let them do it, 
   I wish for once we could have a straightforward debate. Do you want to stop taking this money out of the Social Security trust fund and spend it on other things or not? Yea or nay. Yes or no. Black or white. But you know why we are not having that debate--because our colleagues have already said they want to do this. The President has already said he wants to do this. He has urged us to do it. 
   What is the difference between what they are saying and what Senator ABRAHAM is doing? The difference is simple. They are saying it, and he is doing it. The difference is, they are getting the rhetoric right; he is getting the program right. The difference is, they are saying don't spend it, don't use it for tax cuts, use it to pay off debt. The problem they have is that the Abraham amendment actually pays the debt off, and it would force the Federal Government to get a supermajority vote in order to violate that principle. 
   If you say you are for something and then somebody has a way of doing it and you vote no, what does it mean? Well, to finish and yield the floor, what it means is, you weren't serious when you said it to begin with. 
   The debate here is between people who do want to pillage the trust fund and those who do not. It is that simple. 
   Using this to buy down debt does not solve the Social Security problem, but we have in this amendment the vehicle that would let us use this money we are saving to solve the Social Security problem, if we could reach a bipartisan agreement. But we can't solve it if we don't have the money, and if we don't do something very much like the Abraham amendment has proposed, we are going to end up spending this money. 
   Do you want to spend the money or do you want to see it buy down debt? If you want to buy down debt, support the Abraham amendment. If you don't, vote no but say so. I think that is really what the debate is about. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the budget that is before the Senate. I am sorry that our dear chairman, Senator DOMENICI, is not here, but I want to say some very strong, positive things about this budget, and I wish he were here to hear it. I want to say it mostly because it is true. It would just be a plus if he were here to hear it. 
   It has been my great privilege since I first came to Congress to be actively involved in budget debates. In fact, I remember the first debate I ever was involved in as a Member of the House was a debate about raising the debt ceiling, and I remember as if it were yesterday the House majority leader, Congressman Wright from Texas, stood up and said that we had no choice except to raise the debt ceiling of the Government, that we were in a position that a man would be in if his wife went out and ran up all these debts on the credit card and the debt collector was at the door. 
   Today, in this era of political correctness, no one would ever suggest such a thing. They would say their spouses ran up these bills, and probably the reality would be the man did run up the bills in any case. But the point is that the then-majority leader of the House, in 1979, made the point that these bills had been run up and the bill collector was at the door, and so we didn't have any choice except to pay the bills as any good, honest family would. 
   And so I stand up and say that the first thing I ever said in debate in the Chamber of the House was, well, it is not really the way it works. It is true that honest families would pay their bills, but what they would do is they would sit down at the kitchen table, they would talk about how they got in this financial mess, they would get out the credit card, they would get out the butcher knife, they would cut up the credit card, they would get an envelope and pencil and they would work out a new budget on the back of an old used envelope, and they would start over again. The problem in Congress was we kept simply spending money, incurring debt, raising the debt ceiling, and nobody ever sat down around the kitchen table, nobody ever got out the butcher knife and cut up the credit cards, and so, as a result, we never changed anything. 
   So anyway, I opposed raising the debt ceiling. It failed. And then we tried to offer an amendment trying to tie the debt ceiling to the budget and saying you can only raise the debt ceiling if you balance the budget. 
   Well, to make a long story short, from that time in 1979 until today, I have been involved in debate about every budget that has passed in this Congress or been enforced in this Government since 1979. And let me say  that of all those budgets, this is the best budget that has ever been written by American Government in that period. 
   Now it is probably not, certainly not the most profound budget. The most profound budget was the Reagan budget that was written in 1981. But in terms of what you want a budget to be, it would be very hard to improve on what this budget does. And it is one of my frustrations that everything is now so focused on the war in Kosovo and on many other issues, and we are not having any kind of adequate debate or focus of attention on the profound nature of the budget that is in front of us and what great promise this budget holds for America if we actually enforce this budget. 
   So let me begin by just ticking off some things this budget does, and then I want to get into a discussion of a comparison of this budget with what the President proposed. I want to get into some of these areas like Social Security and Medicare that have 
   been talked about a lot and will be talked about again. But let me outline what this budget does. 
   First of all, this is a 10-year budget that, if enforced, will balance the budget every single year for 10 years. To sort of turn on its head the language of the 1980s, this is a budget that has surpluses as far as the eye can see. And it has those surpluses because it maintains a restriction on spending in a period where revenues are gushing into the Federal Treasury, a period where if we are not very careful we are going to see the launching of a massive new spending spree which could squander the surpluses of today that give us the opportunity to pay down debt, to rebuild Social Security, and do it right this time by basing it on wealth instead of debt, that give us the ability to let working men and women in America keep more of what they earn through a reduction in taxes. If we can keep these spending control measures in place, we can provide adequate Government--in fact, the highest levels of Government spending in American history. And yet by controlling the growth of spending, with the power of the American economy and our competitiveness on the world market and the attractiveness of our capital market with huge amounts of wealth flowing into our equity markets, inflating values, making American families richer, and inducing them to take income and capital gains and pay record levels of taxes on it, we can keep the budget balanced, we can rebuild Social Security based on wealth, and we can cut taxes for working Americans. 
   This budget does all those things. 
   Now, a budget is like a marriage license. It gets you into the deal, but it doesn't make it successful. The easy part is saying ``I do.'' The hard part of a successful marriage is what comes after the wedding. But you cannot have the successful marriage if you don't have the wedding. We are being brought to the altar here with a document that promises all the right things. It is now going to be up to us to enforce those promises. But the key promise, the linchpin of this budget, the element of this budget on which everything else hinges is it enforces the spending caps. If we do not control spending, we are not going to have the surplus. We are not going to be able to rebuild Social Security based on wealth instead of debt. We are not going to be able to preserve a balanced budget, and we are not going to be able to cut taxes. 
   Now, the second thing this budget does, which I rejoice in, is it strengthens our ability to do these things. Every Member of Congress, and I wish every American, understood what happened last year. The President stood up really on the opening day of Congress last year in the State of the Union Address and said save Social Security first. Don't spend a penny of the surplus on either Government programs or tax cuts. Save every penny of it for Social Security. 
   Well, we all know that the President was not telling the truth. We all know that in the end we ended up spending very much of that surplus. We ended up on the last day of Congress taking a third of the surplus that was meant for Social Security and spending it on other programs, and we did it in the name of emergency spending. 
   One of the most important features in this budget is that we have in this budget an enforcement mechanism that says that if someone wants to designate an emergency in nondefense spending, they are going to have to get 60 votes, if somebody raises a point of order. My basic view is, if something is not important enough or enough of an emergency that 60 out of the 100 Members of the Senate will vote for it, then it is not an emergency. 
   I say right now that I personally intend, if others don't, to raise a point of order against each and every emergency spending bill that would raid the Social Security trust fund. I give notice right now that anybody who has an idea that we are going to make all these wonderful promises, that we are going to promise to love, cherish, and obey in this little wedding we are having here on the budget, but that we are going to turn around and start cheating in the fall by breaking this budget by claiming all kinds of expenditures are an emergency, that they better be ready to get 60 votes in the Senate if they are going to be successful. They better be ready for a real battle, because I, for one, believe in this budget, and I intend to fight for it very, very hard. 
   This budget puts a focus on some priorities. It basically says that even in a tight budget not all spending is equal. It puts a focus on veterans' health care, and it does it by, quite simply, taking the position that in a time when you are trying to control spending, you have benefits and you have earned benefits. The basic position of our budget is that those who have served the country, who have preserved its life by wearing with pride its uniform and fighting its wars and by keeping its peace, that even at a time when we have tight budgets, they ought to come first. So this budget provides more money for veterans' health care, and I support it. 
   This budget provides more money for education. It doesn't create the money magically. It takes it away from other programs, with the basic idea that we ought to let the States decide how to spend money on education rather than the Senate being a huge 100-member school. 
   This budget calls for an increase in defense. One of the great unknowns now, not knowing what the war in Kosovo is going to 
   cost, is what is this going to do with our budget and where do we go from here. I want everybody to understand that this budget is written in such a way that we contemplate an increase in defense spending. We want to give a pay increase to everybody in the military. We want to try to provide the pay and benefits and recognition that will help us retain in uniform and recruit the finest young men and women who have ever worn the uniform of the country. Today they wear that uniform with pride, but we have grown increasingly concerned that we are falling behind in recruitment, in retention. We are having trouble, especially, keeping pilots. Now that the President has us deployed in some 30 different engagements around the world, where defense spending has been cut by over a third since its peak in real terms, and yet we have massive military deployments, what is happening is, people are beginning to leave the military. 
   This pay increase that we call for in this budget is vitally important in terms of helping us recruit and retain the best people. Having all these miracle weapons does us no good if we don't have quality people to man those systems. We have the best people in uniform today that we have ever had. We want to keep it that way. That is what this budget does. 
   That is the choice we have. The choice that is presented to us in this budget is, even though we are in a period of record prosperity, even though the level of revenue flows is a record level, what we call for is to limit the growth of Government spending, put a focus on areas like veterans' health care and education and defense, use the surplus to deal with the looming crisis that faces us in Social Security, and to the extent that we have surpluses flowing from the general budget instead of from Social Security, take the bulk of that money and give it back to working families in tax cuts. 
   That is what this budget does. I believe that it is an excellent budget. I think looking at the whole package, it is the finest budget presented in America in the 20 years that I have served in Congress.  
   Talking specifically about several different areas, I want everybody to understand that there is a shell game going on with Social Security. I want to explain, because people have trouble understanding what it is the President is doing on Social Security and what this budget does on Social Security. Let me first explain what this budget does on Social Security, and then explain the fraud that is perpetrated in the President's budget. 
   What this budget does on Social Security is very, very simple. It says every penny that we collect in Social Security taxes that we don't have to have to pay Social Security benefits should be dedicated to Social Security. It ought to be locked away, and it ought to be available to any effort to rebuild the financial base of Social Security. But we should not spend it on any other Government program, nor should we use it for tax cuts. In fact, Senator DOMENICI, in a proposal that is enshrined in this budget, but we will have to vote on separately, sets up a lockbox where we literally change the lending limits that the Government faces, the debt ceiling, so that we will not be able to spend one penny of the Social Security surplus. 
   This is vitally important because, as anybody in the Senate knows, and I wish every American knew, our Government has been stealing every penny of money coming in to the Social Security trust fund. We currently have IOUs for this money that are sent to West Virginia and put in a metal filing cabinet, but the Government then takes the money and spends it on everything but Social Security. None of that money is being used for Social Security purposes. 
   Senator DOMENICI's lockbox would change that permanently and say that this money would be set aside to reduce debt, and it would be available when we can agree with the White House on a way to rebuild the financial base of Social Security. That is a critically important proposal. 
   If the American people knew the extent that we have been stealing money out of the Social Security trust fund, there would be outrage in the country. That is exactly what is happening. The Domenici lockbox ends that forever, and it is vitally important. I hope every Member will support it. 
   Now, let me talk about this shell game the administration is playing on Social Security. Let me say, to begin with, that if you have been involved in every budget since 1979, you have seen phony assumptions, smoke and mirrors, shell games, or whatever the words are that we use. But let me say, so that no one is confused, that in Republican and Democrat administrations I have seen people make assumptions that were wildly unrealistic about the future, about what inflation was going to be, about what interest rates were going to be, about what economic growth was going to be, about what spending was going to be; but those were always assumptions about what was going to happen in the future where at least people could say, well, it may be based more on hope than reality, but it could happen. 
   What the Clinton administration has done is they have brought phoniness, distortion and untruth into the budget at a level which has never existed in the American budget in the history of this country. And no better example exists than under Social Security. 
   I think I can explain it to you very simply. Here are the facts. In the year 2000, the first year of this budget, we projected a $131 billion surplus in the unified Federal budget. If you take every penny we get from every source, and you take every penny we spend on every program or giveaway, or lose, or forget about, and you bring those two together, we are taking in $131 billion more than we are spending. Now, Social Security is taking in $138 billion more than it is spending. So while we show that we have a $131 billion surplus, the reality is that if you don't count the Social Security trust fund, we are actually spending $7 billion more than we take in. 
   So let me show it to you this way. We are taking in $138 billion more than we are spending on Social Security alone. We are then spending $7 billion of that money from Social Security on general government. Now, that would leave you with $131 billion of money for Social Security. 
   What the administration does is it sends to West Virginia this piece of paper that actually prints out on a computer, and it says, ``IOU Social Security $138 billion.'' So they get this piece of paper, they tear it off--and it has actually been on television, and they won't let you photograph the bonds, interestingly--they tear off the perforated edges and they take that $138 billion IOU and put it in the filing cabinet. 
   Now, what happens is, we then spend $7 billion of it immediately, and that brings us down to $131 billion. Now, the President says, well, let's take 62 percent of that and give it back to Social Security and we will spend 38 percent of it. So we started with $138 billion, we spent $7 billion, and then the President says let's spend 38 percent of what is left and then we will send another IOU to Social Security for $81 billion. So out of the $138 billion that they initially had, they send IOUs to Social Security for $219 billion. Now, they started with $138 billion and then they spent $7 billion, and then of that $131 billion that was left, they spent another $50 billion, and then they give Social Security an IOU for $219 billion. 
   Now, any freshman accounting student in any accounting class in America would be given an ``F'' if they proposed on an examination paper such an accounting system. Yet, some of the most highly educated people in America--men and women of great stature--stand up in front of God, a television camera, and everybody else in the world and defend this totally phony, fraudulent, embarrassing proposal. I guess we all have our own standards, but I would not do it. I don't admire people who do it. I think it does a terrible injustice and disservice to the American public 
   that this is happening. 
   I wanted to show this graph to sort of bring the whole thing together. What I have here is plotted between the years 2000 and 2009, the years where this budget is in effect, the Social Security surplus. It starts out at $138 billion and it grows over the period to over $200 billion a year. That is the amount of money that Senator DOMENICI locks away in his lockbox. Now, in addition to the Social Security surplus, because the economy is growing so quickly and because we are controlling spending, if we actually do it, we will get an additional surplus in the rest of the Government in this area that I call ``B'' on this chart. 
   Interestingly enough, what the President does is, he says let's take 38 percent of this unified budget, Social Security plus non-Social Security budget, and let's spend it and then give the rest to Social Security on top of the Social Security surplus that we have already measured. So that is how they start out with the Social Security surplus and then end up with these huge IOUs that they claim they are giving to Social Security. It is interesting because if you look at the President's plan--and this chart is from the Social Security Administration--if you look at their plan, they claim that under their plan they are building up the assets of Social Security from $864.4 billion to $6,697.8 trillion. Yet, when you look at the Office of Management and Budget figures--and all this is put out by the same administration--when you look at their actual level of paying down the debt, that level turns out to be only $2,183.6 trillion. So the question is, What happened to the $3.6 billion? What happened to it? 
   The President says that under his system, with all this double counting of money, he was putting $5.8 trillion into Social Security; yet, his budget shows only $2.163 trillion actually saved for Social Security. What happened? Well, what happened is that none of this money ever went to Social Security to begin with. It was all a paper, double-counting bookkeeping. Their own numbers show it. Yet, nobody is embarrassed enough about it to simply say, well, this is phony and we apologize and we should have never tried to perpetrate this fraud on the American people. 
   Now, I think we can be proud of the fact that in this budget every penny of the Social Security surplus is locked away to be used for Social Security. And when we decide how to save Social Security--and I wish we could decide today; maybe we will tomorrow--those funds will be there for that purpose. I think that is very important and I want to congratulate Senator DOMENICI  for his leadership on this issue. I want to address two other issues and I will speed it up if anybody else comes over and wants to speak. If not, I will give a fairly detailed description of both. 
   The next issue is tax cuts. The budget before us simply says that every penny of the Social Security surplus will be there for Social Security; that of the surplus that is left, we keep a reserve of money that is available for a contingency use which could be used for one of many purposes, and then after we set aside that contingency, we provide the rest of the money for tax cuts for working Americans. After all, the surplus we have is due to the fact that Americans are working harder, working smarter, working in a more productive way, earning more and paying more taxes. 
   There have been several proposals to cut taxes. None of them are endorsed in this budget. This budget simply gives to the Finance Committee the ability to cut taxes. And there have been a lot of proposals discussed. But the one that especially our Democrat colleagues have talked the most about is a proposal to cut taxes across the board. This has given rise to a debate in which I love to engage. Obviously, my Democrat colleagues love to engage in it as well. This is the debate that basically takes the view, as our Democrat colleagues often do, that investment is a good thing but investors are somehow bad people; that wealth is a wonderful thing but people who create it, that somehow there is something wrong with them, or that there is something wrong with letting them keep part of it. I don't understand how you can love investment and not love investors. 
   I view people who are successful as being public benefactors. I never got a job being hired by somebody who made less money than I did. Everybody who ever hired me was richer than I was, which is why they were hiring me rather than me hiring them. And I never resented the fact that people had gotten rich by working in America. But here is what you are going to hear all day today, and here is what you are going to hear as we debate the tax cut. 
   We have a very, very progressive tax system in America. ``Progressive'' is really a phony word. It is a made-up word that is meant to really cloud the issue so you don't really understand. Under our system, if you make more money, you not only pay more taxes proportionately, but the rate of taxes goes up. So that as you make more money, your taxes don't go up proportionately but they go up exponentially. 
   Our system of taxes is so progressive that roughly 50 percent of Americans pay virtually no income taxes. And they pay no income taxes because there are many provisions which were adopted when Ronald Reagan was President in terms of changing the Tax Code. We were able to make some changes with the child tax credit and in our tax cut of 2 years ago that further exempted income from taxes. But the bottom line is that about 95 percent of income taxes are paid for by people who are in the upper half of the income distribution in the country. 
   What our Democrat colleagues have discovered is that we do have a progressive income tax. So that if I pay $5,000 of income taxes, and someone else pays $50,000 of income taxes, and we give a 10-percent tax cut, I get $500 as a tax cut and they get $5,000 as a tax cut. And our Democrat colleagues think that is somehow outrageous. 
   But the point is, the only way you are getting more of a tax cut is if you are paying more taxes. So that what they are really talking about is that the system is progressive. 
   Should it be progressive? You know there are many people who believe we ought to have a flat tax and that everybody ought to pay the same rate. But the point is, if we are going to cut taxes and Senator ROCKEFELLER pays 10 times as much in taxes as I do, or 100 times as much in taxes as I do--I don't know, and I hope he pays 100 times as much because then he is better off and so is America. But, whatever it is, the fact that he would get a bigger tax cut than I do from an across-the-board tax cut is the most reasonable thing on Earth to me if he is, in fact, paying more taxes than I am paying. 
   I believe our No. 1 priority in cutting taxes is we ought to 
   cut everybody's taxes by 10 percent. So, if you do not pay any taxes, you should have learned in the third grade--since I repeated the third grade I remember it--that anything times zero is zero. So with a 10-percent tax cut, if you are not paying any taxes, you don't get a tax cut. You are going to hear our colleagues say, well, 50 percent, or 40 percent, or whatever the number is they choose or make up today, people will get no tax cut under a 10-percent tax cut. The only person in America who will get no cut in income taxes from a 10-percent tax cut by definition is a person who pays no income taxes. 
   Here is my point. Most Americans don't get Medicaid. Most Americans don't get food stamps. Most Americans don't get welfare. Why don't they get those things? They don't get those things because they are not poor. Tax cuts are for working people. Welfare is for poor people. Medicaid is for poor people who are sick. Medicare is for elderly people for their health care. We have many different programs that do not go to everybody. We have very few programs in America that everybody benefits from directly. 
   The point is, if not everybody gets welfare, why should we be shocked that if you do not pay income taxes, that when we cut income tax rates you don't get a tax cut? I don't find that to be shocking. I don't have any trouble saying to somebody in my State who says, ``You cut income tax rates by 10 percent and I didn't get a tax cut.'' I know, because I understand arithmetic, that they are not paying any income taxes anyway. So I don't have any problem saying, ``Yes. That is right,'' because tax cuts are for one unique group of Americans, ``wagon pullers,'' I call them--the people who are pulling the wagon in which so many other Americans are riding; the people who are paying for the Medicaid they don't get, for the welfare benefits they don't get, for the food stamps they don't get. Tax cuts are for the people who are pulling the wagon in which all other beneficiaries of Government are riding. 
   So I don't feel the least bit squeamish about saying that tax cuts are for taxpayers. If you do not pay income taxes, you don't deserve a cut in income taxes, because you are not paying any. 
   We have a surplus because Americans are working harder and paying more taxes. In fact, they are doing it today, tax day. I want everybody who is going to the post office today to send their taxes to the government--if you happen to be on mountain time, or if you are on Pacific time and you have nothing better to do than to turn on C-SPAN--I want you to remember this when you pay your taxes: I want you to remember, you didn't get food stamps, you didn't get welfare, you didn't get Medicaid, but I believe--and the party I am a member of, the Republican Party believes--that you ought to get a tax cut. Our Democrat colleagues are going to say--you are going to hear it, so pay close attention. They are going to say, yes, you get a tax cut. You--this person working in Los Angeles, CA, on your way to mail your check in right now--you get a tax cut. 
   Think of these people that don't get a tax cut. How is it fair that Joe Brown and Susie Brown, who make $21,000 a year, pay no income taxes, and get an earned-income tax credit--which is really a welfare benefit--why is it they don't get a tax cut when you do? The answer is, they don't pay any income taxes and you do. 
   We have this basic viewpoint which our Democrat colleagues find to be radical. That point is, if you don't pay income taxes, you don't get a tax cut; if you do pay income taxes, you do get a tax cut. The more taxes you pay--and God bless you for doing it, because if people are paying record taxes it means they are earning record incomes--I believe, and the great majority of the Republicans in Congress believe, if you pay more taxes, you ought to get a bigger tax cut. That is what an across-the-board, 10-percent tax cut would do. 
   A final point: This used to be a bipartisan idea. John Kennedy proposed an across-the-board tax cut in 1961 which was adopted and became law. His famous words are, ``A rising tide lifts all boats.'' That is still believed by one-half of the political spectrum in America. It is no longer believed by the other half--and that is the half that he was once a part of. 
   To conclude, let me talk a little bit about Medicare. There is no more fraudulent portion of the President's  budget than the proposal about Medicare. Let me give Members a tiny bit of history. We, through an act of Congress, signed by the President, set up a Medicare Commission. In a gesture toward bipartisanship, Republicans--who control both Houses of Congress--agreed to appoint a Democrat, Senator BREAUX, as chairman of that Commission. Senator BREAUX did a great job as chairman of the Medicare Commission. It was my privilege to serve on that Commission. I remember as if it were yesterday President Clinton called the whole Commission down to the White House and talked to us about the terrible problems we had in Medicare and challenged each of us not to let the work of the Commission fail because of us. He challenged each of us to find a way to be for the final proposal. 
   As it turned out, as most people now know, the final work of the Commission did fail. It failed by one vote. Not one single person appointed by President Clinton found a way to be for the final proposal, and they all voted against the Commission proposal. The President, in 3 months, had an opportunity to change American history on Social Security and Medicare, and in both cases he failed. 
   What did the President do in his budget? What the President did in his budget is literally this: He said we are going to pay off debt--though not as much as the Domenici budget--but we are going to name the debt reduction in honor of various programs. That is in essence what it was. In essence, what the President's budget does is send a little note to Medicare that says: You will be happy to know that Federal debt was reduced by such and such an amount and it was done in your name. It would be sort of like our Presiding Officer having someone send a check to his university saying, ``We made a contribution in your name,'' and then you say, ``When do I get the money?'' You don't ever get the money. 
   What the President did in Medicare--which was one of the cruelest hoaxes I can imagine in public policy--the President didn't give Medicare a penny over 10 years, provided no additional money to Medicare. In fact, he cut Medicare, cuts that are not in the budget before the Senate. So he cuts Medicare funding over 10 years, and yet by sending this IOU to HCFA, the agency that runs Medicare, he somehow creates the impression that he has given Medicare more money, when none of this IOU can be spent. In fact, the only way we could ever provide money under this is to raise taxes, to cut Medicare or cut other Government programs. Yet the President creates this impression that he has provided this money that could be used for pharmaceutical benefits or all these other wonderful benefits. It is a cruel hoax. 
   What we do in our budget is set out a procedure where this 
   reserve fund, this reserve money that we didn't use for tax cuts that we kept as a buffer could, in part, be used for Medicare. Our problem in Medicare is we need to adopt the Breaux Commission report. We had a vote on instructing conferees for us to preserve our commitment to that. It is in this budget. We are going to bring that proposal to the Finance Committee. I hope we are going to adopt it. 
   What that proposal will do, in addition to planting the seeds to save Medicare, for moderate- and low-income retirees it will, for the first time, give them assistance on pharmaceuticals. For middle-income retirees and upper-income retirees, by expanding the options that are available, by literally letting them have the same health insurance that I have as a Member of the Senate, it will allow them for the first time to have an opportunity to buy into a plan that will give them some assistance with their pharmaceuticals. 
   I have talked a long time and covered a lot of subjects. Let me conclude by simply congratulating Senator DOMENICI. This is a great budget. If we can enforce this budget, America will be richer, freer, and happier. If we can enforce this budget, we will have an opportunity to begin the long process of rebuilding the financial base of Social Security based on wealth and not debt. If we can enforce this budget, we will pay off Government debt. If we can enforce this budget, we will be able to give working Americans tax cuts. 
   It is one thing to enter the marriage; it is another thing to make it a successful one. This is a very important day, a very important budget. I am very proud to be for it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am going to talk mostly about Social Security and Medicare, but I want to answer two of the points that our dear colleague from California raised. First, she says, Is it fair to give a tax cut and to give nothing to Medicare? The Domenici budget gives this big tax cut and gives nothing to Medicare. Let me just change the question a little. It is not, Is it fair? The question is, Is it true? And the answer is no. 
   Let me just ask our colleagues to look at page 54 of the report on the concurrent budget resolution for the fiscal year 2000. This is the budget reported from the Budget Committee. It provides, beginning this year, for Medicare, $194.6 billion, and by 2009 that has risen to $394.2 billion. So the Domenici budget provides $199 billion of additional money for Medicare by the end of the 10-year period. 
   Let me just make two points. No. 1, Medicare has never grown by more than it grows under the Domenici budget. No. 2, no program has ever grown as much as Medicare grows over this 10-year period. There is not one cut in one Medicare benefit in the Domenici budget. In fact, the President's budget cuts the Medicare Program. The Domenici budget fully funds it. 
   So we all have a right to our opinions, but we do not have a right to our facts.

   Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator for the clarification, but the point is every penny of this $199 billion is out of the surplus because, if it were not provided, that money would be in the surplus. The point is, and I want to be sure nobody is confused, the Domenici budget provides full funding for Medicare over the next 10 years. It has not one cut in one benefit anywhere for Medicare. In fact, no budget in the history of America has provided the funding increase for Medicare that is provided in this budget, and no program, except the buildup for a war effort, in the history of mankind has ever provided the  increase we provide for Medicare. So no one should get the impression that in any way this budget does not fully fund Medicare. It does. 
   Second, and I do not want to get off on this same old debate, dragging the same old dead cat across the table, but it is always an amazing thing to me that when Democrats talk about tax cuts, they think it is always for rich people. When I heard the story, that Senator DOMENICI's mama was out picking lettuce and she started having Senator DOMENICI, and they took her in the house and Senator DOMENICI was born in this house. I don't know why anyone would think Senator DOMENICI does not love working people. I don't know why our Democrat colleagues, most of whom are very wealthy people, why they have this monopoly on loving poor people and Senator DOMENICI, the child of an immigrant family, somehow he does not love working people. 
   Let me tell you what the whole paradox is about. Our colleagues on the Democrat side of this body have discovered that we have a progressive income tax. Senator DOMENICI, what that means is that American workers in the bottom half of the income scale pay virtually no income taxes. And people who are in the higher income brackets pay very high levels of income taxes. 
   So, for example, if we had an across-the-board tax cut where we reduced everybody's taxes by 10 percent, a proposal that was made by John F. Kennedy who, last time I looked, was a Democrat--of course he believed that rising tides lift all boats. I don't know if Democrats still believe that. 
   It was President Kennedy, in 1961, who proposed an across-the-board tax cut. ``Let's get America moving again'' was the Kennedy slogan. 
   When you cut taxes across the board, there are two things that everybody ought to understand, because our Democrat colleagues are going to go on and on and on about it. No. 1 is, some people do not get a tax cut if you cut income taxes across the board. Why? Because they don't pay income taxes. Some people don't get Medicare because they are not senior citizens. Some people don't get welfare because they are not poor. Some people don't get Senate salaries because they don't work for the Senate. But tax cuts are for taxpayers. You don't pay taxes, you don't get a tax cut. 
   Secondly, some people will get a bigger tax cut with an across-the-board tax cut than others. That shouldn't come as any shock, because some people pay more income tax than others. This budget does not make this judgment; this budget simply provides money for a tax cut. We will decide in the Finance Committee what it is. 
   I personally support an across-the-board tax cut. If you want to figure out how much you get--it is very simple and couldn't be fairer, in my opinion--take the amount you pay, take 10 percent of it, that is how much you would save if we had a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut. If you don't pay any income taxes, you don't get any tax cut. If you pay a little income taxes, you get a little tax cut. If you pay a lot of income taxes, you get a lot of tax cuts, but you don't get back what you don't pay. Simple formula. 
   Let me talk about my two issues. 
   The President, 2 years ago, said in the State of the Union Address a brilliant line--``Save Social Security first.'' It was a brilliant line. Everybody stood up and applauded. We waited a whole year and the President never told us how to save Social Security first, last, or ever--never had a program. It was simply a bumper sticker, a slogan. Then this year the President said, ``Oh, the year has come for us to save Social Security.'' He said, ``Don't just save it first; save it now.'' We all stood up, standing ovation. We all applauded. 
   And we had a big conference down at the White House. One of my Democrat colleagues was smart enough not to go. He had already figured out that this was a political sham. But I went. I sat through all these meetings. I sat in a meeting with the President. We had about 60 Members of Congress there. He went around the room and asked people their opinion, agreed with everybody. Then, when we left, we waited for a program. 
   Finally, the program came. Let me say, not to mince words but to be precise with the English language, it was a total and complete political cop-out. It was a political punt. It was a program that basically said: We are not going to make any decision other than we are going to claim that we are locking all this money away for Social Security. I am going to explain how the hoax works. 
   The second issue that is a major disappointment in the President's budget and the President's proposal is Medicare. I was appointed to the Medicare Commission led by Senator BREAUX, a Democrat. We put together a bipartisan coalition to save Medicare. The President killed the Commission. Then he makes a proposal that does not give Medicare a dime, not a dime of new resources. It simply reduces debt and gives Medicare credit for it in a sort of nebulous IOU that can't be spent for 15 years, and can only be spent then if we raise taxes or cut other spending to redeem the IOUs. 
   I want to talk about Social Security and Medicare the way Bill Clinton does it. A lot of my colleagues have racked their brains to try to figure out how the President saves Social Security. Let me explain it to you. I have a chart here, and I hope people can follow it. 
   What I show on the first chart is plotting out over time the Social Security surplus, which starts out here at the current level 
   of $137.6 billion and then it grows over time. That is the amount of money we are taking in, in Social Security taxes, that we are not spending on benefits, plus the interest we are earning on the IOUs that Social Security has from the Federal Government. 
   In addition to the Social Security surplus, we have a general budget surplus from the rest of government that is shown here as B. The total budget surplus, counting the Social Security surplus and the non-Social Security surplus, is the combination of the two I have shown in blue here. 
   Here is what the President does. The President takes the Social Security surplus, which this year is $137.6 billion. They have a guy over in the Treasury who puts into a computer the number $137.6 billion, and out in West Virginia there is this little Federal office with a steel filing cabinet. They have a printout machine, and this prints out this IOU for $137.6 billion. I have seen them on television--at least a man and a woman working there. They may have 10,000 people, but I have seen only 2. The guy normally does it. He goes up and he takes it off the machine, tears it off, takes the perforated edges off, and takes the carbon copy off. Then he puts it in that metal filing cabinet. This is an IOU from the Government to the Social Security Administration. This literally happens. That is the $137 billion. 
   The problem is, we do not have $137 billion, because the unified surplus, when you add the two together, Social Security and non-Social Security, is only $134.6 billion, because we are running an actual deficit in the non-Social Security part of the budget of $2.9 billion. 
   What the President does is, he takes the $134.6 billion we have in cash and he says: Let's take 62 percent of that. That 62 percent is shown in light green here. That is 62 percent of the total budget surplus. He says: Let's spend 38 percent of that. Now, that is $52.3 billion. 
   Remember, every penny of this surplus is Social Security, but in his budget he spends $53 billion of this surplus. Then he says: We are going to give Social Security $83.5 billion. So they already have this IOU in West Virginia for the blue, the Social Security surplus, and now we are going to give them an IOU for the green, 62% of the unified surplus, which of course came from the Social Security surplus. 
   So what we do, we start with $137.6 billion in Social Security surplus. We don't really have it. We are $2.9 billion short, because we already spent that. The President prints out an IOU in West Virginia, and then he takes $134 billion, every penny from Social Security, and he spends $52 billion of it. Then he takes $83 billion that is left and gives it to Social Security again. 
   You might ask, how, with $134 billion, do you give Social Security $221 billion? Well, how you do it is, you give them $137.6 billion and you already have spent $2.9 billion so you have $134 billion. You spend another 38 percent of it, and that leaves you with $83 billion, and you gave that to Social Security.  So what the President has done is double-counted $83.5 billion of the Social Security surplus. 
   The amazing thing to me is that Senator DOMENICI, Senator LAUTENBERG, and I have seen many budgets come and go, and we know we have seen administrations, Democrat and Republican, who made rosy assumptions about the future--of course, nobody knew what was going to happen in the future--that did all kinds of things, but nothing of the scale of double-counting the Social Security trust fund. In the 20 years in the House and the Senate that I have watched budgets come and I have watched them go--more go than come, in many cases--I have never before seen the level of dishonesty that exists in the budget President Clinton has submitted this year. 
   It is not rosy assumptions about the future, it is plain fraudulent bookkeeping. 
   The amazing thing to me--having appeared on television with senior officials of the Clinton administration to talk about this issue, having listened to them in testimony--is how educated people who have credibility independent of serving in the Clinton administration can come before the public and come before the Congress and defend this; it is totally beyond my comprehension. 
   It is totally beyond my ability to understand the willingness of people to say something that they know, because every one of them took freshman accounting in college--if a freshman economic student at Harvard had proposed this double-counting scheme, our dear colleague, Larry Summers, the smartest guy in the Clinton administration, would have given him an F. And yet poor Larry Summers is dragged on CBS television to defend double-counting bookkeeping. 
   Having gone through it, let me just show you some of the manifestations of it. If you take the President's budget, he claims that he is locking away $5.8 trillion for Social Security in the future. Remember, these are all IOUs, and it does not make any difference whether you have one or you have a cigar box full. They all are commitments for which we are going to raise taxes, cut spending, or borrow money in the future. But I am simply talking about gimmicks. 
   The President claims $5.8 trillion that he has put in the Social Security trust fund. But yet when you look at what he has actually locked away, it is only $2.2 trillion. Let me just show you the numbers from his own budget. 
   This is the first document that comes from the Social Security Administration, and it shows the President's proposal:  
   Under the President's plan, the Social Security trust fund will rise from $864 billion to $6.6 trillion, an increase of $5.8 trillion during the year 2000 to 2014.  
   That is what the President says he is doing, locking away $5.8 trillion for Social Security. But when you actually look, I say to Senator DOMENICI, at the President's budget from the Office of Management and Budget, there is a ``Social Security lockbox transfer used to redeem debt.'' They are not redeeming $5.8 trillion, the amount set aside for Social Security, they are redeeming $2.183 trillion. 
   What happened to the other $3.6 trillion? It is missing. You cannot find it in their books. What happened to it? It is a funny thing about double-counting bookkeeping, you can double count all you want, but when you finally open up the box, you only have in there what you put in there. That is basically what the President does. 
   When our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle say the President does these great things for Social Security, what he does for Social Security is double count the entries he is making in the Social Security trust fund, but nothing the President does in any way will pay any benefit past 2012 because at that point we open this box, and all it has is IOUs. Then we have to raise taxes or cut spending or cut Social Security benefits, or we have to borrow money to pay for it. 
   Finally, let me read you a quote. Probably the best summary of the Clinton Social Security proposal was in a major article by David E. Rosenbaum in the New York Times on March 24. Here is his summary of what he calls ``the shell game'' in the Clinton Social Security proposal. Listen to this quote. He is talking about the Clinton plan on Social Security:  
   The plan does nothing more than throw new IOUs at the problem and avoids tough choices needed to keep subsequent generations from having to pay the bills for the retirement of the baby boomers.  
   What is being called a plan to save Social Security is, in fact, a phony bookkeeping scheme to double count the number of IOUs put into Social Security. Not only is it fraudulent, but it is a hoax, because the IOUs in Social Security do nothing to pay 
   benefits. You cannot pay benefits with IOUs. You have to have money, and the only way you can get money is to tax or to cut spending or to borrow the money from the general public. 
   The second hoax in the Clinton budget is the hoax of Medicare. This year, the President killed the Medicare Commission report, and his alternative to it was to send an IOU to Medicare. He said, going back to this surplus, ``Look, we started out with $134 billion and we gave $221 billion of it to Social Security. That worked great. Having taken 134 and given 221 of the 134 to Social Security, why don't we give 15 percent to Medicare? It worked great for Social Security, let's do it for Medicare.'' 
   So what he does is he sends this meaningless IOU to Medicare only, as Senator DOMENICI was the first to discover, there is a big caveat on this IOU, and that is, you cannot spend it. He does not provide any new benefits. 
   He talks about drug benefits and how wonderful it would be to have them, but he provides not one penny for drug benefits. None of this money can be spent under the President's budget. It is simply a meaningless IOU. I guess we will open another office in West Virginia and we will hire people and they will print out the IOU for Medicare and put it in a metal filing cabinet, but does it fund one prescription drug? No. Does it pay for one day in the hospital? No. Does it pay for one home health care visit? No. 
   If it does not do any of those things, what good is it? It is good because it is a political weapon. The President can say, ``I gave 15 percent of the surplus to Medicare.'' You cannot spend it. It will not buy any of these things, but I did it. 
   The point is, Senator DOMENICI could have done all these things, and more, if he were willing to use phony bookkeeping. But thank goodness he is not willing to use phony bookkeeping. He did fund--fully fund--for 10 years Medicare.

   Mr. GRAMM. Let me make a concluding point, and then I will be happy to yield. 
   The President had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to save Social Security this year, and he did not do it. The President had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with a bipartisan commission to plant the seeds to save Medicare, and he did not do it. To use a parody on a very famous commercial, the Presidency is a terrible thing to waste, and President Clinton has wasted Presidential leadership on Medicare and Social Security with phony programs that serve no purpose except to mislead the American public and to prevent real debate on these issues. 
   I will be happy to yield.

   Mr. GRAMM. I say, in conclusion, that the Domenici budget has a real process to lower the debt limit that the Government operates under to assure that not one penny of Social Security money will be spent on anything else. We will have a vote on that lockbox. Many people who say, ``We want to stop the plundering of Social Security,'' will have an opportunity to do it, because the Domenici proposal will stop Social Security money being spent  for any other purpose. I intend to support it. 
   I congratulate Senator DOMENICI. And I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as I understand the discussion that Senator DOMENICI just had, the target was to try to finish all of these amendments at 6:30. Obviously, since we are going back and forth and sharing the time, the Senator, and anyone else, can debate his amendment. 
   The objective was and the unanimous-consent request which was agreed to, as I understand, was that between now and 6:30, we would have these amendments offered, but you can debate your amendment at any point and anyone on your side can debate it, and Senator DOMENICI and I will debate it. We have been setting aside amendments to stack them, and that, I understand from the Chair, is where we are. No one is trying to preclude the Senator from debating his amendment.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we want to do everything we can to satisfy every Member. No one is trying to deny the distinguished Senator the right to debate his amendment. But it is my  understanding that there was a unanimous consent request, and that it was granted, so that we could set the amendment aside and offer these other amendments so that they would all be pending simultaneously and that we would have the vote at approximately 6:45. No one agreed to the specific time, but the general principle was largely agreed to. 
   On that basis, it is my understanding that Senator BOND has been recognized. If that is not the case, if the Chair could give us a ruling. We want to follow the regular order. And no one is trying to be unfair in any way.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to speak on the pending amendment by Senator CONRAD, and then I understand the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee wants to speak on the Conrad amendment. Then we will set the Conrad amendment aside, if there is no objection, and yield to Senator BOND, who will offer his amendment. If anyone wants to give an immediate response, they can. Then we will yield to Senator KENNEDY, let him offer his amendment. At that point, Senator DOMENICI will be back to speak on the Conrad amendment. If Senator CONRAD wants to respond, he can. Then we are at least at that point closing in on a vote of all these amendments. None of this is agreed to, but follows that general parameter. If no one objects to it, let me proceed.

   Mr. GRAMM. I certainly will not take 60 minutes. 
   Mr. President, in the Budget Committee we had a series of amendments and they all had a common theme: Do anything with the surplus except give it back to working Americans. 
   We had an amendment that said you could not give a tax cut until you had fixed Social Security for 75 years--that would be the year 2074, so you could not do a tax cut before the year 2074; you could not give a tax cut to working people until Medicare was fixed for a similar period. You could not give a tax cut until Jesus came back. You could not give a tax cut until Bosnia and Serbs and Bosnia and Croats routinely met, fell in love, got married and, like the lion and the lamb, lay down together. 
   When you listen to all this rhetoric and all these amendments, what they have in common is not all the things that have to happen before a tax cut, but what they have in common is our Democrat colleagues do not want working Americans to get any of the non-Social Security surplus back. 
   We find ourselves with the highest tax burden in American history. When you take Federal, State, and local taxes, 31 cents out of every dollar earned by every American goes to government and taxes. With the history of our country, such as at the peek of the war effort in World War II in 1944 when we had the largest defense spending in American history and the highest tax burden in American history prior to today, even with the highest tax rate in American history, our Democrat colleagues would say: ``Defer tax cuts until the year 2074, defer tax cuts until all the problems of the world are solved, defer tax cuts.'' 
   The point is, they are not for letting working Americans keep some of the money that we are now taking from them above the level needed to pay the taxpayers' bills. Remember that every penny of the Social Security surplus by the pending budget will be set aside and locked away for Social Security. Now, this is the newest variant of this ``anything but tax cuts'' amendment. This variant says, ``Don't give the money to tax cuts; reduce the debt and then give an IOU to Medicare.'' 
   I want to remind my colleagues that this doesn't provide a dime for Medicare. 
   Not one penny of this money can be spent under the budget. If we adopted this amendment, Medicare would not have one nickel that it doesn't have now. It would have an IOU from the Federal Government. But how would we pay the IOU? We would pay it by raising taxes, by cutting spending, by cutting Medicare, maybe, or by borrowing money from the general public. But nothing we do today in giving an IOU to Medicare provides any money for Medicare either today or in the future. 
   So this is not a real transfer of resources. When our dear colleague from Rhode Island on the Budget Committee says we need to give the resources to Medicare, no resources are given to Medicare in the budget of the United States. If you look at that budget, which has a $199 billion increase, the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota doesn't change one penny of spending for Medicare over this period. In fact, what the Senator from North Dakota is doing is not changing Medicare spending, not providing any new benefit, not paying any old bill; he is simply giving Medicare an IOU. 
   Now, what is the net product of this IOU? That is the point I want to get to. The net product of this IOU is not more money for Medicare; the net product of this IOU is that in the year 2009, Medicare insolvency will occur unless we pass a reform bill, like the Breaux reform, which I strongly support and supported as a member of the bipartisan Medicare Commission. Unless we do something that is a real reform, in the year 2009 we are going to have to raise payroll taxes, or raise general taxes, or we are going to have to cut spending, or we are going to have to borrow money, whether or not we give an IOU to Medicare. Nothing in the Senator's amendment changes the amount of money that is available in the 10-year budget for Medicare. 
   But what is changed by the amendment? Medicare is no better off, no worse off; it has an IOU. We already have many IOUs to Medicare because of our commitment to the program. It is probably the second most popular program in American history and one to which we are all committed. Nothing changes for Medicare. No new resources are available to Medicare. No hard choices are avoided in Medicare. But what is changed? Well, what is changed is that this amendment will reduce the amount of money that is available for tax cuts by $320 billion. That is what this amendment is about. The actual change in the budget as a result of this amendment is to reduce the amount of money that is available for tax cuts. 
   So what are we doing here? This is an amendment that has only one substantive effect; that is, it reduces our ability to eliminate the marriage penalty. Americans meet and fall in love and get married, only to discover that they pay the Federal Government, on average, $1,400 a year for the right to be married. Knowing the Presiding Officer's wife, I know she is worth $1,400 a year, but I believe--and so does the Presiding Officer--that she ought to get the $1,400, not the Federal Government. In fact, I know the wife of the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, and I know she is worth $1,400 a year, and we want her to have the money. We don't understand why the Senator from North Dakota doesn't think she ought to have it instead of the Government. In any case, that is a matter of personal choice. 
   The point is, what we are doing here does nothing for Medicare, but it affects our ability to repeal the marriage penalty. There are many people who believe it is not right to force farmers and ranchers to sell the farm and sell the ranch when papa dies. He spent his whole life building up the farm or the ranch and put every penny of after-tax money he ever had into the farm or ranch. When he dies, the children have to sell the farm or ranch to give the Federal Government 55 cents out of every dollar. We want to end that. 
   The amendment of the Senator from North Dakota doesn't help Medicare a bit, but it takes away from our ability to exempt farms and ranches from this confiscatory death duty and exempts small businesses from this confiscatory death duty. We believe we ought to have an across-the-board tax cut. 
   Now, we know many of our Democrat colleagues don't believe we should have an across-the-board tax cut, and they very quickly point out, well, with an across-the-board tax cut, some people don't get a tax cut. That is true. But across-the-board tax cuts are for people who pay taxes. So everybody who pays taxes would get an across-the-board tax cut, and people who pay a lot of taxes would get 10 percent of that back. People who pay a little would get 10 percent of that back, and they would both be happy to have it back. 
   Now, what the Senator from North Dakota is saying is that he would rather not repeal the marriage penalty, or repeal or reduce the inheritance tax, or have a tax cut across the board, or any of the many other ways we could give this money back, because he would rather it not go back to the taxpayers. So the net effect of this amendment is that it doesn't change Medicare, doesn't change a single spending figure over the 10-year budget; it gives Medicare a meaningless IOU, basically. But what is changed, what is substantive, is that it lessens our ability to reduce the tax burden for working Americans by $320 billion. 
   Let me make one final point on this. Let me give you the 
   advantage of giving some of this non-Social Security surplus back to taxpayers rather than having the Government keep it and ultimately spend it. We all remember last year when President Clinton stood at the rostrum of the House and said:  
   Social Security first. Every penny of this surplus will go to Social Security. I won't allow it to go on tax cuts, I won't allow it to be spent.   
   Yet, the President, as a tribute for adjourning, required that $21 billion of it be spent. Every penny of it came right out of Social Security. So if we don't give this non-Social Security surplus back--or at least part of it--to workers, we are going to end up squandering it; we are going to end up spending it. 
   Now, the advantage of giving it back is, first, it is their money to begin with. This money came from the working people. The economy is doing better because they are working and saving and investing more. Why should they not get some of the benefit--in fact, a very small percentage under our budget? 
   Another thing is important. If we need the money back, we can take it back. But if you spend it on a bunch of new programs creating a bunch of new constituencies, it is gone; you will never get it back. How many Government programs have we ever eliminated in American history? Virtually none. 
   So I just want to urge my colleagues, when they listen to the debate on this amendment, to remember that these amendments aren't about denying a tax cut until 2074 to save Social Security, or put off a tax cut until Medicare's problems are forever solved, or to wait until the second coming and let Jesus worry about it, or to wait until world peace is enshrined. That is not what these amendments are about. These amendments are about some of us not wanting to give people a tax cut. That is what it is about. 
   So if you think that out of the massive surpluses we are projected to have over the next 10 years, giving a modest tax cut to working Americans in things like repealing the marriage penalty, reducing or repealing the death tax, and giving a little across-the-board tax cut to everybody--if you think workers deserve some of the benefits of the good economy and the impact it has had on taxes, rather than giving every penny of it to the Government, then you want to vote no on this amendment, and you want to vote no on a whole series of amendments, each of which is going to be tied to some other issue, like research to prevent meteorites from causing tidal waves or destroying New York City--or it will go on and on and on. But the bottom line is, this is about tax cuts. 
   And our colleagues are desperate. They want to spend the money. They want to do everything with the money except give a little of it back. That is where we have a disagreement. 
   Do not be confused. This doesn't have anything to do with Medicare. Nothing in this amendment in any way provides another nickel to pay Medicare benefits. Nothing in this amendment changes the Medicare numbers in this budget at all. This simply reduces debt; God's work, if it really happened. But what it does is give a meaningless IOU to Medicare. We already have written Medicare so many IOUs that we will never pay back the ones we have written. If you want to, give them a cigar box full. And, if it makes you feel better, great. But still, it is a promise to pay money. It is not money. 
   So I hope our colleagues will reject this amendment and realize it is not about Medicare. It is not about Social Security. It is not about meteorites. It is not about the second coming. It is about taxes. Some people are against them. Other people are for them. 
   That is what the vote will be about. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to be careful in what I say. But our colleague suggested that we be honest. 
   I want to be very honest. What we have before us is a totally phony amendment. Let me go through and explain why. Let me touch a couple points. 
   First of all, this save Social Security business and lock the money away for Social Security, that didn't come from Bill Clinton. That came from PETE DOMENICI. That is in the budget before us. I want to thank Senator DOMENICI for that. 
   Let me just run down the list of things here. First of all, our dear colleague brought out a quote from me about using money from Medicare. To paraphrase Paul Harvey, let me tell you the rest of the story. 
   Last year, our Democrat colleagues were trying to raise taxes on the poorest among us, on a tax where 60 percent of the tax was paid for by Americans who made $25,000 a year or less. It was a cigarette tax. The claim that the Government had the right to part of the money was that people smoke. They get smoking-related diseases and it costs us money in Medicare. 
   So Senator DOMENICI and I said, If you are going to collect money in cigarette taxes and you suddenly have this giant windfall--as one of the lawyers, I guess, of these people that our dear colleagues talk about, these rich people, said, ``This is like winning a lottery,'' talking about the millions of dollars that had gone from the settlements--Senator DOMENICI and I said last year, Well, if you are going to tax tobacco and you are going to impose the tax on people making $25,000 a year or less that pay the bulk of tobacco taxes--they are concerned about poor people today, but last year they were raising their taxes--Senator DOMENICI and I said, Well, if you are going to do that, at least spend the money on Medicare for health care. 
   Now, when it was clear they weren't going to be able to spend it on all their social programs, their amendment died. But that is where that quote came from, if we are going to be honest. 
   Let me make it clear that all this business about ``the Domenici budget does not provide a penny for Medicare,'' not so. The Domenici budget provides more money for Medicare than any budget ever written in American history. It provides $199 billion of new money. It funds every penny for Medicare. The President proposed cutting Medicare funding by $20 billion over the same period. So this is not about Medicare. This is about tax cuts, and it is about politics. 
   Now, this ``richest among us''--I do not understand people who love capitalism and hate capitalists. I do not understand people who love investment but hate the people who make investments. I don't make $1 million a year. If I were really productive, maybe I would. But let me just tell you the trick behind all these charts. The trick behind all these charts is that tax cuts are for taxpayers. So if you don't pay any income taxes and we cut income taxes, you don't get a tax cut. Some people say, Well, that's not fair; I don't pay income taxes, but if they are going to give a tax cut, I ought to get some of the money. 
   Well, ask working people. Do they get Medicaid? No. Do they get food stamps? No. Do they get housing subsidies? No, because they are not poor. Those programs are not for working people. Tax cuts are for working people. So if you don't pay any taxes, you don't get any tax cuts. 
   Now to this business about what if somebody makes $800,000 a year and they get a $20,000 tax cut. Outrage. Well, if they get a $20,000 tax cut, it meant they paid $200,000 of taxes. So 
   if I paid $20,000 of taxes and I get a $2,000 tax cut, why shouldn't somebody who paid $200,000 get a $20,000 tax cut? Do we have to debate every issue by trying to pit Americans against each other? What is wrong with people making money? What is wrong with people being rich? They didn't make the money by stealing it from somebody. They made it by producing something of value and selling it. I would just like to say that we get tired of having the people who are making $1 million a year tell us about tax cuts for rich people. 
   I don't get it. Senator DOMENICI is from an immigrant family. I told the story earlier about him almost being born in a lettuce patch where his mama was picking lettuce. Neither of my parents went to high school. Suddenly we care about rich people and our colleagues, many of whom are rich, are going to protect people against rich people. 
   Here is the point. Why not give everybody a tax cut? This bill does not give an across-the-board tax cut. It just provides money for tax cuts. Obviously, one of the ones that will be debated, everybody will get a chance to give their speech about these outrageous rich people who paid $1 million a year in taxes and we want $2 million. We want every penny they have. We want to put them in prison. The point is, with an across-the-board tax cut, you get 10 percent, whatever you pay, you get 10 percent of it back. 
   If that hurts your feelings, you live in the wrong country. It doesn't hurt my feelings. 
   Final points and I will get out of Senator DOMENICI's way. Senator KENNEDY asked, What does this do to the lifespan of Medicare? Well, let me tell him. Nothing is the answer, zero, zip. The lifespan of Medicare is supposedly to 2008, but it is only to 2008 because President Clinton took part of the cost out of the trust fund and put it into general revenue. So Medicare already went broke. But it is 2008 today and, if this amendment were adopted, it would still be 2008, because this amendment provides not one nickel, one penny, one million, one billion, nothing to Medicare. It gives Medicare a meaningless IOU, and we still have to cut spending or raise taxes or borrow money in order to pay it.

   Mr. GRAMM. Well, let me say that this is a phony amendment in every respect except one. It has nothing to do with Medicare. It doesn't have any impact on Medicare. Normally in these amendments, you have all this folderol and meaningless stuff at first, but when you get to the last page and the last paragraph, you get to the bottom line. What this amendment does is, it reduces the levels of funds in section 104(1) by which the Senate Committee on Finance is instructed to reduce revenues. 
   So what this amendment is about is denying people a tax cut. Our colleagues are for tax cuts in general, even though both our colleagues voted for the last amendment which would  have denied any tax cut. They are for them in general. They are for eliminating the marriage penalty in theory. They are for changing inheritance taxes in theory. But when it gets right down to giving somebody a tax cut, they are against it. 
   Why are they against it? As long as we have been asked to 
   be honest, they are against it because they want to spend this money. They are against it because they want to spend this money on programs, just as they did last year when we busted the budget by $21 billion and stole every penny of it right out of the Social Security trust funds and they voted for it. 
   So let's not be deceived. I was asked to be honest and I wasn't going to be, because I didn't want to be unkind. But since I have been asked to be honest, let me be honest. This is a phony amendment. It has nothing to do with Medicare and everything to do with denying tax cuts. Our colleagues on the left side of this Chamber want to spend this money, and we don't want them to spend it. We want people to have it back. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, a continuing problem with the emergency supplemental appropriations is that it is not paid for. 
   I would like to remind my colleagues--and I will try to be brief--that last year the President in the State of the Union Address took the hard and fast position that we should save Social Security first. The idea was that the whole surplus of the Federal budget should go to Social Security and should be used to reduce the outstanding debt of the Government. 
   As everyone remembers, in the waning hours of the session last year we passed an emergency appropriations bill that contained numerous nonemergency items. And the net result was to spend $21 billion--roughly one-third of the surplus--every penny of which was Social Security surplus. Therefore, in the words of the President, we had plundered the Social Security trust fund to fund all of these other programs of Government. 
   As I am sure everyone is aware, along with the budget that will come to the floor of the Senate immediately following disposition of the issue on Kosovo, we will consider a lockbox provision that requires a reduction in the debt held by the public by the amount of Social Security surplus. That will automatically lower the debt limit we will set by law each time we have a Social Security surplus. So the net result will be that each and every penny of the Social Security surplus will, in fact, be locked away, going to debt reduction in the name of Social Security. While none of that saves Social Security, it does mean that none of it is spent on general government and that we actually reduce the indebtedness of the Federal Government in the process. 
   Right in the face of this effort to lock away the Social Security surplus for Social Security, we found ourselves with an emergency supplemental appropriations bill which is not paid for. And, in fact, in its current form, the bill increases spending and therefore takes $441 million right out of the Social Security surplus in fiscal year 1999. And then, adding this year and the next 4 years, it would take almost $1 billion out of the surplus; $956 million would, in fact, be taken out of that surplus. 
   It seems to me we can't be credible talking about a lockbox to lock this  money away for Social Security at the very same moment that we are spending the money. 
   So I have sent two amendments to the desk. One makes across-the-board reductions in the previous emergency bill we passed in areas other than agriculture and defense to such a degree that we pay for the $441 million. So the emergency supplemental at that point will be deficit neutral in fiscal year 1999. 
   The second-degree amendment, which I have submitted on behalf of myself and Senator NICKLES, because in fact it was his amendment that he reserved the right to offer--the second-degree amendment is an amendment which waives the emergency designation, which will mean that this $515 million of spending in the years 2000 through 2005, will count toward the spending caps in those years. So by spending the money now, we will lose the ability to spend that amount of money in future years. 
   These are two straightforward amendments which have one overriding virtue, and that is, they pay for the supplemental. 
   Let me say of my colleague, the Senator from Alaska, that I am very grateful he has decided to accept these amendments. I know this only means postponing the battle until conference. 
   There was a clever little poem I learned as a boy. And I am sort of ashamed to say that I forget exactly what the rhyme was. But it was, ``He that is convinced against his will is unconvinced still.'' And I know that in this case, wanting to get on with this bill, our dear colleague, our loving colleague from Alaska, is convinced against his will to take these amendments, and I know he is unconvinced still. 
   But the point is, we would have the ability to go to conference with our bill fully paid for and with no emergency designation. 
   That would put those of us who believe that this should be the way we do business in this country in a position in conference to try to sway others. On that basis, I will be willing, with the adoption of these amendments, to let the bill go to conference where, obviously, at that point this will be fought out again. 
   Let me conclude, before the Senator from Alaska changes his mind, by simply saying we are going to have to come to a moment of truth here. We cannot write budgets that say we are going to control spending and then continue to spend. We cannot lock away money for Social Security and then spend the money for Social Security. I know it is hard--when the President says one thing and does another--for Congress to say something and then actually do it because, obviously, it is easier to say it and not do it than it is to say it and then do it. But I do believe the American people have a higher standard that they apply to us, and I think the adoption of this amendment, especially if it can be held in conference, is a major step forward in getting credibility back into the budget. 
   On that basis I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMM. Yes, I can tell you I not only have an idea, I think it is clear there is only one reason anybody would be against it, and that is they want to say they are saving Social Security, but they do not want to do it. They want to have it both ways. They want to give great and flowery speeches about ``Save Social Security first, save Social Security now,'' but when it gets right down to it, what the provision of my colleague in the budget does by changing the debt ceiling is it actually makes it impossible for them not to do it unless they can get 60 votes in the Senate to raise the debt ceiling. So the only reason they would oppose it is they do not intend to do it.

   Mr. GRAMM. Anybody who is opposed to your bill is refusing to write into law in a binding manner what everybody pledges verbally to do. The provision of the Senator from New Mexico is an enforcement mechanism. And the only reason anybody would be against enforcing an antiplundering provision on Social Security is if they intend to plunder. I think that is what the whole issue is 
   about.

   Mr. GRAMM. Well, first of all, I don't know of any effort in the past, prior to 1979, when I came to the Congress. There had been no legislative action since 1979 that would have locked in a process to enforce debt reduction. This is the first in my experience of service in the Congress. My guess is there has never been a similar proposal before, but we do have an extraordinary circumstance. We have a President who is committed to saving Social Security money and using it for debt reduction. We have 100 Members of the Senate who say they are for it. Your amendment gives us a happy opportunity to marry all this up with a binding constraint. The question is, who is for real and who is not for real on this issue. That is what will be determined.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to thank my Scottish cousin, Senator GRAHAM, for letting me go first so I can go back to the Budget Committee. 
   I am very happy to be here and join both Senator GRAHAM of Florida and my colleague from Texas in strongly opposing this amendment. 
   The idea that the Federal Government is trying to seize $18.9 billion from the States to spend in Washington, DC, when we had nothing to do with their settlement and when we were in the process of trying to impose our own taxes and, in fact, when the President has in his budget the imposition of new taxes on tobacco, is absolutely outrageous. 
   The amazing thing is the President proposes taking the money away from the States and then giving them a bunch of money, but then telling them how to spend it. 
   This amendment is the height of absurdity. In my State, this amendment would tell Texas that we have to spend $4 billion on smoker cessation. We could literally hire thousands of people and have a personal trainer for each person who are chewing tobacco or dipping snuff. Why should the Federal Government have the right to tell the States how to spend this money? 
   I suggest our colleagues read the tenth amendment of the Constitution--powers not specifically delegated to the Federal Government are reserved to the several States and to the people. 
   This amendment is an outrageous power grab. Where we in Washington, the day before yesterday, were trying to be the school board for all America, now we are trying to tell the States how to get people to stop smoking, when we have done a very poor job of it in the Federal Government. We are trying to tell the States how to spend their money. Somewhere this has got to stop. My suggestion to our colleagues is, if you want to run the schools in America, quit the Senate and go run for the school board. 
   If you want to be a State legislator, leave the Senate and run for the State senate or the State house or run for Governor. Our job is not to tell the States how to spend their money. 
   This is an outrageous amendment. I just cannot understand the logic of this, other than the belief that only we know what is best. The idea that we on the floor of the Senate will tell Texas how they have to spend $4 billion over this period is absolutely absurd--that Texas has to file a report every year  with Health and Human Services, and then they have to approve how Texas is spending its own money that the Federal Government had nothing to do with, had no part in claiming, no role in the settlement. In fact, in the President's budget this year where he tries to reclaim this money, he is talking about imposing a tobacco tax. Are we going to let the States tell us how to spend that money? I think not. 
   I congratulate my colleague from Texas. This is an amendment that deserves to be defeated overwhelmingly. I hope 80 or 90 of our fellow Senators will vote against this amendment. Again, if you want to tell Texas how to spend its money, quit the Senate, move to Texas, establish residence, run for the State legislature; if you can get elected, go at it. But do not get elected from another State and come here and try to tell our State or any other State how to spend its money. 
   The Federal Government needs to butt out. We have plenty of our own problems to deal with here. Social Security is going broke, Medicare is going broke quicker, and what are we doing? The day before yesterday, we were trying to run all the schools in the country as a national school board. Today we are trying to spend money in every State to tell them how to deal with their tobacco settlements. 
   It seems to me we are running away from real problems that we ought to be solving and trying to find somebody else's problems to solve where we don't have any responsibility if things go bad. 
   Again, I congratulate my colleague from Texas. I congratulate the Senator from Florida. I thank him for letting me come in and speak at this time. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators HUTCHISON, BINGAMAN, DOMENICI, KYL, MCCAIN, BOXER, FEINSTEIN, and GORTON, I am introducing legislation today which will authorize the United States Customs Service to acquire the necessary personnel and technology to reduce delays at our border crossings with Mexico and Canada to no more than 20 minutes, while strengthening our commitment to interdict illegal narcotics and other contraband. 
   This bill represents the progress that we made in this regard in the last Congress, and it builds on efforts that we initiated last year. This legislation passed the Senate unanimously on October 8, 1998, and a similar companion bill passed the House of Representatives on May 19, 1998 by a vote of 320-86. In addition to the resources dedicated to our nation's land borders, this bill also incorporates the efforts of Senators GRASSLEY and GRAHAM in adding resources for interdiction efforts in the air and along our coastline, provisions that were passed by the Senate in last year's bill. 
   I am very concerned about the impact of narcotics trafficking on Texas and the nation and have worked closely with federal and state law enforcement officials to identify and secure the necessary resources to battle the onslaught of illegal drugs. At the same time, however, our current enforcement strategy is burdened by insufficient staffing, a gross underuse of vital interdiction technology, and is effectively closing the door to legitimate trade. 
   At a time when NAFTA and the expanding world marketplace are making it possible for us to create more commerce, freedom and opportunity for people on both sides of the border, it is important that we eliminate the border crossing delays that are stifling these goals. In order for all Americans to fully enjoy the benefits of growing trade with Mexico and Canada, we must ensure that the Customs Service has the resources necessary to accomplish its mission. Customs inspections should not be obstacles to legitimate trade and commerce. Customs staffing needs to be increased significantly to facilitate the flow of substantially increased traffic on both the Southwestern and Northern borders, and these additional personnel need the modern technology that will allow them to inspect more cargo, more efficiently. The practical effect of these increases will be to open all the existing primary inspection lanes where congestion is a problem during peak hours and to enhance investigative capabilities on the Southwest border.  
   Long traffic lines at our international crossings are counterproductive to improving our trade relationship with Mexico and Canada. This bill is designed to shorten those lines and promote legitimate commerce, while providing the Customs Service with the means necessary to tackle the drug trafficking operations that are now rampant along the 1,200-mile border that my State shares with Mexico. I will be speaking further to my colleagues about this initiative and urge their support for the bill.

   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I join with Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON in introducing a bill to name the Austin, Texas federal building in honor of a great Texan: Congressman J.J. ``Jake'' Pickle. Congressman Pickle became an institution in Washington, D.C. throughout his 30-year tenure in Congress, and his dedication and service to the people of Austin and Central Texas continue today. I had the pleasure to serve with him in the House of Representatives, and I hold him in high esteem for the man he is and the spirit in which he served. Jake Pickle walked with giants like Lyndon Johnson and Sam Rayburn, and he is a giant in his own right. I believe that naming the federal building in Austin in Jake's honor is a fitting tribute to his service on behalf of our great state and in recognition of his significant and ever-lasting contributions to our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we now find ourselves in a situation where the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, have introduced a regulation called ``Know Your Customer.'' This regulation has a 90-day public comment period which will end on March 8. On behalf of the Banking Committee, Senator BENNETT and I sent a letter to each of the regulators, urging them to drop this proposed regulation. I would like to briefly tell our colleagues what this regulation does. 
   Under these regulations imposed on every bank and every thrift in America, banks and thrifts would have to set up a program to document a system of internal controls for compliance with the regulation including independent testing, monitoring of day-to-day compliance, and annual personnel training. 
   What all this would be geared toward is looking at the bank account of every single American who has an account, large or small, in any thrift or any bank in America, to determine the identity of any new customers, to determine the customer's source of funds in bank transactions, to determine the particular customer's normal and expected financial transactions, to monitor account activity for transactions that are inconsistent with the normal and expected transactions, and to report transactions of customers that are determined to be suspicious to the regulatory authority. 
   If you ever wondered what happened to all those people in the former Soviet Union who used to run things there and now are permanently out of work, the answer is they are all in the Clinton administration and they are running the banking authorities of this country. Can you imagine having in place in America regulations so if your mama doubles the contribution she makes on Sunday to the church, her banker looks at it to see if it is out of the ordinary? 
   I don't doubt that somewhere, somebody had some good intention. The objective here is to look at money laundering. But the problem is, this is such a broad-reaching regulation that it infringes on our constitutional rights. 
   I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to amendment IV in the Constitution. Amendment IV says:  
   The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated. .....  
   Our Federal Government has no right to routinely monitor your bank account. Our Federal Government has no right to keep records on where your money comes from, or how you write checks, or how you spend your money, unless there is some clear, compelling case that you are violating the law. What these bank regulators have done is not only run afoul of public opinion--over 135,000 Americans have filed comments in opposition to this process--but they have run afoul of something more important than public opinion. They have run afoul of the Constitution of the United States. 
   As a result, not having heard a definite answer from the regulators, members of the Banking Committee are here today to begin our process of engaging in oversight to be sure that when we pass laws, as we did setting up these agencies, that those laws are adhered to. 
   I believe our committees spend too much time writing law and too little time seeing that regulatory agencies abide by that law. 
   I have two colleagues here today who have been leaders in this effort to introduce the bill that we were unable to call up because a unanimous consent was objected to. Let me first yield to Senator ALLARD.

   Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator would allow me to reclaim my time, very briefly, not only is it an unconstitutional, unjustified, and unwarranted search and seizure, but wisely, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Credit Union Administration have not promulgated such rules. While we are being critical, and justifiably so, of the agencies that have, we should point out that these agencies did not follow suit, and I think they deserve some credit. 
   The point is, if I know that the Federal Government is going to be spying on my little bank account that might have $1,100 in it, and I can take it and put it in a credit union or put it in a mutual fund and have some degree of privacy, every little bank, every savings and loan or community bank in America ends up being disadvantaged, because the Federal Government is using them to snoop on their customers. As a result, they lose customers.

   The point is, you have 260 million Americans who lose a constitutional right, when you have financial institutions that have every confidence that people have in the security of their deposits, not that they are going to lose the money but that they are going to lose their freedom to take their paychecks, deposit in their bank without people knowing how much they have deposited, and spend their money on things they want to spend it on without being second guessed as to whether this expenditure was out of the ordinary, with language like ``determine the particular customer's normal and expected transaction.''

   Mr. GRAMM. Take a bank in a medium-sized town and take the personnel they have, how in the world could they possibly comply with this outrageous regulation without it costing, on a nationwide basis, literally billions of dollars? 
   I think one of the complaints that we have on this issue is a very simple one, not only is it unconstitutional, not only is it outrageous, but it shows, again, how callous Federal regulators are about the costs that are imposed on American business, and the loss of freedom for American consumers. It is sort of the idea that if someone has a social experimentation, it is the job of Americans to comply with their experiment and it is the job of business to pay for it. 
   Nowhere in the regulation does it suggest that the Government is going to pay the bank in your hometown or the bank that is in a shopping center near where you live in Colorado; there is nothing in the regulation that says they are going to pay for all these costs. Who do you think is going to pay for it? You are going to pay for it with fees on your checking account. You are going to pay for it with lower rates of return on your CD. You are going to pay for it when you borrow money to buy your home or buy a car or borrow money on a guaranteed student loan to send your child to college. You are going to pay for these regulations in higher costs. 
   I am delighted that the Comptroller of the Currency has become concerned, but why didn't they think about this before they promulgated this regulation? 
   The point is, our job on the Banking Committee is to stop this kind of thing from happening.

I do know we are here this morning to talk about education, and that is very important. But I say to my colleagues, in apologizing for having to disrupt their debate, that this is about education. When we have the Federal Government imposing regulations that will cost our financial institutions billions of dollars to comply and that will end up driving up the cost of loans as people borrow money to send their children to college, I think it is something with which we have to deal. 
   We are reaching the point where we could have a final determination. We are encouraged that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has raised concern about it responding to 140,000 objections. But the point is, on Monday, we are going to have, potentially, a final determination. We had hoped when we sent a letter on February 10 that we would get action. We did not get that action. As a result, we are here today.

   Mr. GRAMM. Can we turn this up? 
   Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. I don't think the question is audible. 
   Well, that is a different--it's not as sophisticated a sound collection system as the U.S. Senate used in the depositions here, so I apologize for the fact that that was inaudible but the question was asked of the President:  
   Q. After you gave her the gifts on December 28, did you speak with your secretary, Ms. Currie, and ask her to pick up a box of gifts that was some compilation of gifts that Ms. Lewinsky would have?  
   His answer:  
   No, sir, I did not do that.  
   His denial and then the facts presented by Ms. Lewinsky and the circumstantial evidence, the question was asked of Ms. Lewinsky:  
   Q. Did the President ever tell you to turn over the gifts? 
   A. Not that I remember.  
   But when I say that she that testified unequivocally, whenever Ms. Lewinsky was asked ``Did you later that day receive a call from Ms. Currie,'' the answer was, ``Yes, I did,'' and she goes ahead and explains it. There is no hesitation. There is no question. But their memory is clear that the call came from Betty Currie. 
   Now, how could Betty Currie know to go pick up the gifts? I think you understand there is only one way that could have come about, and that would be through a communication from the President to her. 
   Now, let's go on down the path. After we see the meeting on December 28, there was a meeting at the Hyatt on December 31. We could play this video--I would like to--with Vernon Jordan and with Ms. Lewinsky. This is a meeting at the Hyatt that Mr. Jordan totally denied ever happened in his first few testimonies before the grand jury. But in his most recent testimony before the Senate, in the deposition, he was confronted with receipts from the Hyatt, and the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky which was clear, and the corroborating facts. And he said yes, in fact, it did happen. And not only did he recall the meeting, but then he recalled what was discussed, that yes, in fact, notes were discussed there. 
   And Ms. Lewinsky testifies that she raised the issue of other evidence that would be possibly in her apartment, notes to the President. According to her testimony, she was told that: You need to get rid of those. 
   Now, Mr. Jordan totally denies that. But the point is, there is more evidence at risk for the President. Mr. Jordan, who is doing the work for the President, has this conversation with Ms. Lewinsky that he earlier denied ever happened. 
   So, I think you look at credibility there. You believe Ms. Lewinsky? If you accept the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, then you have more evidence that is at issue, and that is being urged to be destroyed and not available for the truth-seeking endeavor in the civil rights case. I think that is significant. 
   Now, you say that is not the President, that is Mr. Jordan. You have to put this in context. It is Ms. Lewinsky who says that she is talking to the President when she is talking to Mr. Jordan--and I am paraphrasing that, but that is what she was seeing--seeing Mr. Jordan as a conduit to the President. 
   Then we go on after the meeting in the Hyatt, we go into January, where the job search continues. But it is tied directly to the signing of the affidavit, which is false by its nature. 
   If we look at the testimony of Mr. Jordan, in the January 5 timeframe where the affidavit is prepared and discussed with Mr. Jordan:

   Exhibit C--which I hope you have; we asked them to distribute that--is a statement that Mr. Ruff portrayed, from me, which in my presentation I said: ``The judge--the witness list came in, the judge's order came in, that triggered the president into action and the president triggered Vernon Jordan into action.'' 
   Now there are two things that I am pointing to as the trigger mechanisms for the job search intensification. One of them is the witness list that comes in on December 5, the President knows about, at the latest, on December 6. The other thing that intensified that effort was the judge's order on December 11. 
   They went through this long circumstance of Mr. Jordan being in Holland and the time of the phone call with the judge and all of that, showing that the judge's order of December 11 could not have triggered any action on the 11th. There is no question about that. That is obvious from the facts, as it was obvious when I made my presentation. The meetings on the 11th, with Vernon Jordan and Monica Lewinsky, were triggered by the witness list coming on the 5th, that the President knew about on 
   the 6th, that he discussed with Vernon Jordan as well. 
   Now, we say that the judge's order of the 11th, which was filed that day--the only thing that was filed on the 12th was their memorandum of that telephone conversation--that triggered additional action down the road. The job search was not over; the activity continued into January. And, so, that all put pressure on the ultimate fact, in January when the job was obtained, the false affidavit was filed. 
   Now let me just point to a couple of other things along that line. We need to look at this because they basically make the point that there is not any connection between the false affidavit--and that is my characterization--that was filed, and the job search. But if you look at the testimony of Vernon Jordan, and that is exhibit--I think they are giving them out now--F, that I am presenting to you, the sworn testimony of Vernon Jordan which was on March 3 of 1998, he testifies in answer to a question:  
   Counselor, the lady comes to me with a subpoena in the Paula Jones case that I know, as I have testified here today was about sexual harassment........you didn't have to be an Einstein to know that that was a question that had to be asked by me at that particular time because heretofore this discussion was about a job.  
   And then he says, ``The subpoena changed the circumstances.'' And I think this is important, that Mr. Jordan, who is filled with common sense, he says you don't have to be an Einstein. You don't have to be learned, like Mr. Ruff or any of the other White House counsel, to apply common sense. Common sense tells you that whenever he knew about the subpoena, it escalated to a new arena and obviously the witness list would have the same impact. 
   And, so, Mr. Jordan himself makes the connection, the job search was one thing but whenever she became a witness in the Jones case, that changed everything. That changed the circumstances. And let me tell you, that is a friend of the President who is making that statement. 
   And, so, we have to take this picture, that they were related as they were going two tracks, they became interconnected and became one track. 
   The final point--and this was raised on the job search issue--that the call by Mr. Jordan to Mr. Perelman, the CEO of the parent company of Revlon, really had no impact on Monica Lewinsky getting a job because there is a misinterpretation as to how well she did on the interview. But if you look back to the testimony, the grand jury testimony, there was a connection, because Mr. Jordan calls Mr. Perelman and, as he characterized it: Make it happen if it can happen. Mr. Perelman then calls Mr. Durnan, and then Mr. Durnan calls Ms. Seidman, who was actually doing the interview the next day with Monica Lewinsky. 
   So the person who was going to make the decision whether to hire Monica Lewinsky got the word down through the channel before that interview took place and before the decision was made. And of course the important thing is: What was the intent? Not the result, but the intent. And I think that you can see that there was an intent to make sure that Monica Lewinsky was taken care of. Again she was on board, part of the team, before she actually would have to give testimony or the President would have to give testimony.

   Mr. GRAMM. President, I rise today with Senator GORTON to introduce a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment which is designed to protect Social Security. Since we last considered a balanced budget amendment in the Senate, we have achieved balance in the unified federal budget for the first time in 30 years, and have made substantial progress toward achieving balance without relying on the surpluses currently accumulating in Social Security. For 1998, the Department of the Treasury reports that the federal government ran a unified budget surplus of $70 billion, and an on-budget deficit of $29 billion when the $99 billion surplus in Social Security is not counted. This on-budget deficit is  projected to disappear by 2002 under current budget policies. 
   The Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment I am introducing today is identical to S.J. Res. 1 of the 105th Congress, which received 66 votes in the Senate on March 4, 1997, except that surplus revenues in Social Security are not counted in determining compliance. 
   The President and a majority of Congress have expressed support for balancing the budget without counting Social Security surpluses, and now that goal is within our reach. We should take this opportunity to approve this Constitutional amendment and send it to the States for ratification. This Constitutional amendment would provide the structure and enforcement mechanism to allow us to achieve this bipartisan goal.
