 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I want to note my disappointment that the permanent relief for Haitian refugees that I and many others in this body have worked to make law has been dropped from the Treasury Appropriations Conference Report. 
This effort began last year during debate of the D.C. Appropriations bill, which included language that granted certain Central Americans access to the `suspension of deportation' procedure, but Haitians were not granted this access. And you may recall that while I supported granting relief to the affected class of Central Americans, I, along with several of my colleagues here in the Senate and the House, fought vigorously for additional provisions for Haitian refugees. 
Although we were unsuccessful in that effort, we later introduced S. 1504, Haitian Immigrations Fairness Act of 1997, legislation that would provide Haitian refugees permanent residency status. During the course of this year, this legislation was reported favorably out of the Judiciary committee and passed by the Senate as a provision of the Treasury-Postal Appropriations Fiscal Year 1999 bill. Eventually, this language was agreed to by the Conferees on the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill. Unfortunately, due to last-minute, close-door maneuvering and negotiations, there is no Haitian relief included in the Conference Report that we are voting on today. 
This legislation is vitally important to the several thousand Haitian men, women, and children who came here in the wake of the military coup in Haiti that in 1991 toppled the democratically elected government of that country. That coup was followed by a period of military dictatorship in Haiti marked by atrocious human rights abuses, including systematic use of rape and murder as weapons of terror. The International Civilian Mission, which has monitored human rights conditions throughout Haiti, documented this tragedy, including horrors so awful as to be almost imaginable. 
To allow such human rights violations to occur so close to home while doing nothing would have been inconsistent with the stated goals of our foreign policy. So in 1991, the U.S. took in persons fleeing Haiti at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. After intense screening, many of these individuals were paroled into the U.S. to apply affirmatively for asylum. Between the 1991 and May of 1992, over 30,000 Haitians were interviewed. Under one-third of these individuals were paroled into the U.S. to seek asylum. 
Around Memorial day in 1992, Bush issued the `Kennebunkport Order,' ending the asylum screening process at Guantanamo Bay, an action which became an issue during the 1992 presidential elections. A refugee program began operating in Port-au-Prince. This practice continued until 1994, when President Clinton reinstated a screening process in military hospital ship in Kingston Harbor, Jamaica. Democracy was restored in Haiti in the fall of 1994. 
The individuals that I am talking about today are the children, wives, brothers, and sisters of soldiers and activists who stood up for democracy in Haiti. They fled to this country for refuge. They played by our rules. In the time that they've been here, they've built homes, paid taxes, had families in our country. These individuals are owed nothing less than treatment equal to that already provided to the Eastern European and Central European refugees residing in our Nation. 
I regret that the Conferees decided at the last moment to strip the Haitian refugee relief provision from the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill, but I would like to urge Senators Lott and Daschle to consider adding this provision to any omnibus appropriations measures that may be considered in the upcoming days.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution that encourages the Bureau of Printing and Engraving to incorporate tactile features on the currency to aid the blind. This resolution enjoys considerable bipartisan support, and was passed by voice vote in the House of Representatives. 
Four years ago, Mary Scroggs, a constituent of mine, was hit by a drunk driver on the sidewalk in front of her office as she walked to lunch. As a result, she was left visually-impaired. Since this time, she has tirelessly pursued opportunities to improve the ability of the visually-impaired to live independently. It was her voice on this issue which brings me to introduce this important legislation. 
In March 1994, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing commissioned the National Academy of Science to execute a study entitled `Current Features for Visually Impaired People.' This report explored the methods of making currency more accessible for all Americans. 
In 1997, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing began implementing significant changes to simplify the identification of currency, such as larger numbers and higher color contrast, to ease identification of counterfeit currency. This resolution simply endorses the efforts of the Bureau of Printing and Engraving to study the cost-effective tactile changes to aid those afflicted with low vision or blindness and encourages those changes in the national currency. 
This minor change in currency will have a significant impact on the independence of visually impaired Americans. Moreover, incorporating tactual features can serve other purposes, such as being an additional counterfeit deterrent. 
Visually impaired individuals are capable, independent people whose valuable contributions touch all of our lives. It is important that all Americans are afforded equal opportunities to perform at the best of their abilities. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is my honor to rise today to recognize a distinguished resident and successful businessman from my home state of Illinois, Mr. Rodrigo d'Escoto. Last month, Mr. d'Escoto was named the National Minority Male Entrepreneur of the Year by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Minority Development Agency. This award recognizes Mr. d'Escoto's Hispanic heritage, his success as an entrepreneur, and his service and dedication to the community. 
Mr. d'Escoto is the founder and chairman of d'Escoto, Inc., a Chicago-based architectural engineering firm. Established in 1972, d'Escoto, Inc. is one of the largest Hispanic-owned firms of its kind in the Midwest. Over the last twenty five years, the firm has participated in some of the most ambitious and important design/construction projects in the Chicago area. These projects include the Northwestern Memorial Hospital Expansion project, the expansion of the McCormick Place Convention Center and Hotel, the construction of the new Cook County Hospital, the ongoing expansion of O'Hare International Airport and the construction of the airport's new international terminal. Certainly, Rodrigo d'Escoto and d'Escoto Inc. have contributed greatly to the look and structure of Chicago, one of the world's great architectural cities. 
As is often the case with someone who has achieved so much professionally, Rodrigo d'Escoto is a committed community member. Among the many boards and organizations that Mr. d'Escoto has given his time and expertise to are: the Harold Washington Foundation, the Urban League, the United Way, the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Pilsen Resurrection Development Corporation, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, the Centro Hispano Americano, the City of Chicago Planning Commission, the Alliance of Latinos and Jews, and the Hispanic American Construction Industry Association. It is important to note that this is only a partial list of the many worthwhile and important enterprises that Rodrigo d'Escoto has touched over the years. 
Mr. President, as one can see, the dimensions of Rodrigo d'Escoto's professional and civic accomplishments are of breathtaking proportions. Indeed, he is quite deserving of being named the National Minority Male Entrepreneur of the Year. I am confident that my Senate colleagues will join me in congratulating Mr. d'Escoto and d'Escoto, Inc. for this prestigious award, and in wishing them much continued success in the future.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a short colloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens. 
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the conference report included $3 million in the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Navy account of your Fiscal Year 1999 Department of Defense Appropriations bill for continued funding of the Advanced Materials Intelligent Processing Center in Evanston, Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I greatly appreciate the support that the subcommittee provides for this project. I would like to confirm that the intent of the conferees was to provide this additional $3 million to continue the activities of the Center in affiliation with the Naval Air Warfare Center in Lexington Park, Maryland, as well as other industrial and governmental partners. This continuation funding will allow the Center first to complete a state-of-the-art resin transfer molding system with all required equipment functionality, monitoring, and intelligent supervisory control, and then to transfer it to the Center's industrial and governmental partners for prove out in a production environment.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his clarification on this matter, and for his assistance on this project. I also thank Senator Inouye of the subcommittee for his support of this project. I would also like to say to my colleagues that I am confident the work of the Center can help reduce the cost of our defense systems through the use of faster, cheaper, and better means of processing composite materials for military hardware. These improvements will provide substantial dividends to the American people.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, and the ranking member, Senator Hollings, as well as Senators Ford and Gorton for their patience and help in working with me to reach an acceptable agreement regarding O'Hare Airport. 
I do not think I need to remind them how upset I was when I learned they had added a provision to the FAA reauthorization bill adding 100 additional flights per day at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The provision was added to the original legislation without consulting the local officials who manage the airport, without input from the mayor of Chicago who is responsible for the airport, without input from the local communities surrounding the airport who will be most affected by additional noise and air pollution, and without consulting either of the senators from Illinois. 
This provision immediately raised a firestorm of criticism in the Chicago area. I have an inch-thick stack of newspaper clips from about a 10 day period after this provision appeared in the FAA reauthorization bill, which attests to the deep level of interest Chicago-area residents have in this matter. 
O'Hare is already the busiest airport in the world. There are at least 400,000 people whose daily lives are affected by the noise and air pollution generated by the airport. The quality of life of these suburban residents must be taken into account before changes are made affecting the number of operations at O'Hare Airport. 
While I was displeased that the new-flights provision was added to the FAA bill without consulting me, the chairman and ranking member have since been gracious and accommodating and have worked with me to reach an agreement on this issue. I want to thank the chairman for his patience, and for his willingness to work with me on a compromise that I believe accommodates his needs, as well as the needs of Chicago-area residents. 
The agreement we reached reduces from 100 to 30 to the number of additional flights per day at O'Hare. The agreement provides that 18 of the 30 slot exemptions will be reserved for `under-served' markets, and no less than six of the 18 will be `commuter' slot exemptions reserved for planes with less than 60 seats. 
Before any of these slot exemptions are made available, the Secretary must: certify that the additional flights will cause no significant noise increase; certify that the additional flights will have no adverse safety effects; consult with local officials on the environmental and noise effects of the additional flights; and perform an environmental review to determine what, if any, effect the additional flights will have on the environment. 
In addition, only `Stage 3' aircraft, the quietest type of aircraft recognized by the FAA, will be eligible to use the new take-off and landing slots. 
Finally, after three years the Secretary of Transportation will study and report to Congress as to whether the additional flights resulting from the new slot exemptions have had any effects on: the environment, safety, airport noise, competition at O'Hare, or access to under-served markets from O'Hare. 
The Secretary will also study and report on noise levels in the areas surrounding the four `high-density' airports (Chicago O'Hare, Washington National, New York LaGuardia, and New York JFK) once the national 100 percent Stage 3 requirement is fully implemented in the year 2000. 
I believe this agreement goes a long way toward addressing the concerns of the local officials and residents of the cities surrounding O'Hare. I want to again thank Senators McCain, Hollings, Ford, and Gorton for their attentiveness and understanding. The people of Illinois spoke out in response to the O'Hare provision they inserted in the FAA reauthorization bill, and these Senators listened. 
I am particularly pleased that the agreement we reached on this issue, that was reflected in the managers' amendment adopted yesterday, allows this important FAA reauthorization legislation to advance in the Senate. This bill must become law before the end of the year in order to ensure that important airport improvement projects are not delayed or disrupted. 
The legislation also includes several important provisions designed to increase air service to small and under-served communities. In Illinois, some of the most serious complaints regarding air service come from our small and medium-sized communities that want air service to O'Hare and other major airports in order to attract global businesses. I am delighted I was recently able to help restore air service between Decatur, Illinois and O'Hare. The restoration of this service will help the city of Decatur, which promotes itself as `America's Agribusiness Center,' grow in today's global economy. There are a number of communities across my state demanding flights to Chicago and New York, and the provisions of this legislation should help them get more air service. 
I want to again thank the chairman for his understanding. 
Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure to join the Illinois chapter of the American Association on Mental Retardation in honoring the recipients of the 1998 Direct Service Professional Award. These honorees are being recognized for their outstanding commitment and contributions to the lives of people in Illinois with developmental disabilities. 
These award winners have distinguished themselves through their compassion, dedication, patience and professionalism. Their work not only enriches the lives of those who they care for, but also enriches all of our lives and sets an example of service for all Americans to follow. 
It is important to note that the individuals being honored are professionals who spend at least 50 percent of their time directly working with and assisting their clients in the clients' life-space. These people are not supervisors or managers. Instead, they are direct service providers on the front-lines of our nation's mental health care system, delivering much needed and much appreciated care and assistance. 
It is indeed my privilege to recognize and celebrate the achievements of the following Illinois direct service professionals: Henry Barrington, Raymond Betke, Shelly Cross, Caroline Frost, Patty Hart, Zarina Hasham, Debbie Huff, Carolyn Johnson, Molly Kuster, Preston McBride, Pearlene McDougal, Patricia Mercer, Lisa Pyle, Della Reese, Michael Smith, Marie Thompson, Marcia Weidman, Jodie White, Katie Whiteford and Sabrina Willis. It is my honor to serve these dedicated professionals in the United States Senate. 
I am confident that my colleagues here in the Senate will take this opportunity to join me in saluting the winners of the 1998 Direct Service Professional Award. These awardees represent the best spirit of community service.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to speak about a few of the compelling reasons that the Senate should pass the amendment to increase the minimum wage by $1.00 per hour by the year 2000. 
I am a cosponsor of this legislation because I believe that by raising the minimum wage now, we can accomplish a number of critical objectives. We can improve the quality of life for millions of Americans, expand the market for all of the goods and services that the workers of our nation produce, increase the amount of taxable income in the country, reduce expenditures for public assistance, close the ever-increasing gap between working people and wealthy individuals, and--certainly not least--honor the American tradition of rewarding hard work and perseverance. 
The current minimum wage is not a living wage for the millions of Americans who try to support themselves and their families on $5.15 an hour. Today, 6.2 million Americans earn the minimum wage. In my state alone, 5.7 percent of the workforce--making up roughly 296,000 people--earns that salary. This means that an Illinoisan, working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earns only $10,712 per year. That's about $2,600 below the poverty line for a family of three and over $5,700 below the poverty line for a family of four. And make no mistake about it--this is an issue that directly affects families. As much as opponents of this amendment would like us to believe that the minimum wage primarily affects teenagers working at their first jobs, the actual fact is that three-fourths of those earning the minimum wage are adults, many trying to support families. And with respect to the fact that one-fourth of those who will be assisted by this legislation are teenagers, we should bear in mind that many teenage minimum-wage workers contribute the money they earn (or at least a portion of it) to their families' total income. 
A $1.00 increase in the minimum wage would provide a full-time worker earning the minimum wage with a little over $2,000 a year in additional income. That money could pay for more than seven months of groceries, more than four months of rent or mortgage bills, over a full year of health care, or more than nine months of utility bills for a family living on the minimum wage. That $2,000 would make a world of difference to such a family. 
Moreover, a family that can pay for rent, groceries, or health care is putting money back into the economy. That family is buying goods and services produced by other workers. It is also earning taxable income and reducing the amount government has to spend on public assistance. An increase in the minimum wage helps people to contribute to, rather than burden, the nation's economy. And it wouldn't just be minimum wage workers who would be able to make a greater contribution to the economy. Currently, there are almost six million Americans who earn between $5.16 and $6.14 per hour who would also receive a pay raise if this amendment were to become law. All 12 million Americans who stand to benefit from this legislation--not just the 6.2 million earning the minimum wage--must be taken into account when we consider the fact that adopting this amendment would increase the pool of consumers and increase taxable earnings. 
I wish to take this opportunity to dispel a myth that many opponents of increasing the minimum wage have put forward over the years: that paying a living wage means losing jobs. Around the time that we debated raising the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour, a group of respected economists, including three Nobel Prize winners, concluded that such an increase would have positive effects on the labor market, workers, and the economy. In 1996 we went ahead and raised the minimum wage to $5.15 per hour and what happened? Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that employment increased. Four million new jobs have been created since that time. Unemployment has hovered around its lowest rate in a generation. This will not surprise anyone familiar with the scholarly literature on this issue. The Economic Policy Institute studied the effect of the last minimum wage increase on the economy and found that it had no negative impact on jobs or inflation. A recent study by economists at Berkeley and Princeton Universities showed that the type of moderate increases in the minimum wage that we are debating today do not cost jobs. It should be noted that their research included the increase we enacted two years ago. 
Some have argued that small businesses would be hurt by Senator Kennedy's amendment. The reality is that many such businesses will suffer if we do not raise the minimum wage. Small businesses which right now pay a living wage to their employees are at a competitive disadvantage with those that try to cut costs by slashing wages. This creates a race to the bottom with the most profits going to companies paying the lowest wages. Adopting this amendment will ensure that all businesses will be able to afford to pay a decent wage to their workers. 
I would like to make a point regarding how this amendment would affect 
single working women. Twenty percent of those earning the minimum wage are female heads of households. These are women who are taking responsibility for themselves and their children. They are doing precisely what we have told them we expect them to do: get a job and go to work every day. We have told them that AFDC is a thing of the past, that they cannot rely on the government to take care of their families. I am not seeking to re-open the welfare reform debate. But I do want to know how we can send these women that very clear message and then fail to provide a minimum wage that allows them to support their families at a level above the poverty line? The fact that a single mother working full-time cannot bring her family out of poverty represents a clear policy failure on our part. With this legislation, we have the opportunity to take a step towards addressing it. 
Right now, our economy is strong. The unemployment rate is low and new jobs are being created in record numbers. This economic strength, however, has not translated into increased wages for many of those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. In fact, the income disparity between the richest and the poorest is increasing. Consider, for example, what has happened in my state. Over the last 20 years, the income disparity between the richest and poorest Illinoisans has increased by over 46 percent. During that time, the average income of the poorest twenty percent of families in Illinois fell by $1,460 to $10,000. At the same time, the average income of the richest twenty percent increased by over $25,000. An increase in the minimum wage will help close that gap. 
I conclude by reminding my colleagues that at the heart of the American Dream lies the belief that hard work is the foundation of success. Fortunately, for most people in this country, that remains a valid notion. But it is not for those who earn the minimum wage. We must guarantee that those attempting to provide for themselves and their families by earning the minimum wage receive a living wage. Here in Washington, we talk a great deal about family values and the American Dream. There's nothing wrong with that as long as we stand up for those ideals ourselves when given the opportunity. This amendment represents just such an opportunity and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for it.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce two bills today with my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, that will benefit farmers in rural America. 
As my colleagues may be aware, farmer-owned cooperatives play a major role in providing food and fiber to consumers. These cooperatives also provide their farmer-owners with additional market stability and help to strengthen farm income. 
Current tax law states that farmers, fruit growers, or `like associations' that are organized and operated on a cooperative basis for the purpose of marketing the products of its members or other producers shall be exempt from federal income tax if those cooperatives are developed for the purpose of marketing the products of the members or other producers, and turning back to the members proceeds of the sales, less marketing expenses. 
Farmers nationwide are joining together in self-help efforts to develop cooperatives and to develop new uses for the commodities that they grow, but recently the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled that in certain instances, some forms of value-added farmer-owned cooperatives are not tax exempt. The Grassley/Moseley-Braun bill would overturn that IRS ruling and amend the current section of the tax code to explicitly cover these types of cooperatives. 
Another concern that farmers have shared with me is the future of agriculture and the ability of their children and other beginning farmers to enter into farming as a way of life. I have worked in the Senate to change federal policies that will lower the obstacles for younger farmers who enter into farming as a profession. 
One such program is the `Aggie Bonds' program. In the 103rd Congress, I cosponsored the law that granted a permanent tax exemption for these bonds. I also worked to include provisions in the Small Business Tax Relief Act of 1996 to widen eligibility for the bonds, increasing the amount of land a beginning farmer may own to qualify for the loan. 
Today my Iowa colleague and I introduce a bill that further improves this successful program by exempting aggie bonds from the volume cap on industrial revenue bonds. Currently, Federal law allows states to issue tax exempt industrial revenue bonds that are earmarked for purchases of farmland, equipment, breeding livestock, as well as farm improvements by new or beginning farmers. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) also has authorized State chartered, non-profit corporations to make guaranteed mortgage and farm operating loans. Unfortunately, the aggie bond program and the FSA guaranteed farm mortgage programs have size limits of $250,000 and $300,000 respectively. 
Given the rise in property costs, these limits fail to provide meaningful funds for small farm purchase or often time prevent certain classes of farmers from obtaining credit. In addition, aggie bonds are subject to statewide `caps' applicable to both small farmers and established users. 
Most industrial revenue bonds are typically issued for million of dollars, underwritten, rated and sold to investors. Aggie bonds, 
which cannot exceed $250,000, are not underwritten, are not rated, and are not sold to investors; they are sold to local lenders who finance beginning farmers with a lower than normal interest rate. Most of the private-activity bond volume is used by large corporations for manufacturing or for multi-family housing. Aggie bonds are used by beginning farmers and ranchers. 
Several states, such as Illinois, has discovered that the volume cap is already used up by non-agricultural projects, and many states cannot meet the demand for Aggie Bonds. 
Exempting Aggie Bonds from the volume cap would greatly enhance the opportunities for young or beginning, less established farmers and ranchers to acquire affordable, low cost credit for agricultural purchases such as land, livestock, machinery, and farm improvements. The Moseley-Braun/Grassley bill exempts aggie bonds from the volume cap. 
These two bills will help farmers in Illinois, Iowa, and all of rural America. I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting these bills and I urge their swift passage in the United States Senate.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I want to talk about the facts and share with listeners a letter from Kate Hlava, from Oak Park, IL. These are her words: 
My pregnancy had been complicated from the beginning, but doctors kept assuring us that everything was fine. We went in for a routine ultrasound at 20 weeks, and our world came crashing down. The results of that ultrasound were an expecting parent's worst nightmare. The baby had a serious heart condition known as tetrology of fallot with absent pulmonary valve and overriding aorta. 
We saw numerous experts across the Midwest, resulting in just as many prognoses. At that time, we were given the option of terminating the pregnancy. We chose not to because we so desperately wanted the baby. We hoped and prayed every day that the baby would make it to term. If he was born prematurely, he would not have been able to have the operation he needed to survive, a surgery he would have needed every few years as he grew. 
Unfortunately, he was not strong enough to make it to term. He began showing signs of heart failure during the 27th week of my pregnancy. His liver was huge, his heart was enlarging, and I was retaining too much amniotic fluid. I had started to dilate and was going to go into labor soon. There was nothing the doctors in Illinois would do. 
I couldn't leave my house. I was contemplating suicide. As my baby was dying, so were pieces of myself, and no one here would help me stop it. In Illinois, had my baby been born, even prematurely and with no real chance of survival, the doctors would have been legally obligated to try to keep him alive. They would have performed fruitless and painful procedures on him, making his few moments on this earth a living hell. I didn't want that for my son. No parent would. 
It was then that my obstetrician suggested that we go to Kansas for a therapeutic abortion because of fetal anomaly. I have lived my entire life believing that abortion may be right for other people but that I never wanted to make the decision. I absolutely do not believe that a woman should be able to choose to terminate her pregnancy at 27 weeks because she is tried of being pregnant or because she was told the baby had brown eyes instead of blue. 
I have met other women who have undergone a similar procedure. Not one did so because she didn't want the baby. These women, like myself, wanted their babies and still miss them, but the prospect of bringing an extremely sick baby into the world, who would suffer a short life full of painful medical procedures, felt inhumane. Medical science is sophisticated enough to diagnose such anomalies at the fifth month of pregnancy. 
I am not sure where Bryne [The Editorial writer to whom Ms. Hlava is Responding] got his description of the procedure, but it is not the procedure I had. He described it as `all but the head of a living fetus is pulled from the mother, its brains sucked out, causing death and making it easier to remove the baby.' This description is enraging. In my case, the baby was given an injection to stop his heart and then, through the insertion of laminaria, labor was induced. 
I saw my son after delivery. He was beautiful, and his body and head were intact. The process was very humane and the baby was saved from any undue suffering. 
I wish that I did not have to go to Kansas in January. I would give anything if my baby could have been born healthy. I think about him every day and miss him terribly. The one thing I am thankful for is that my son was able to die peaceful and painlessly. Kate Hlava, Oak Park.  
That is a letter, from a real woman who had this procedure performed on her this year, that just appeared in our local papers in Illinois. 
Mr. President, President Clinton was right to veto this legislation. He was right because Congress, as a body, is not licensed to practice medicine. If the imposition of our judgment serves to condemn women to death or premature disability or cause the kind of harm that Kate Hlava talked about, then we will have clearly failed to live up to our responsibility to act in the best interests of the people who sent us here. 
This debate is about whether or not women are going to have the ability to make decisions regarding their own reproductive health, whether they will retain their constitutional rights, and whether they will be able to make decisions regarding their own pregnancies. In the final analysis, it is ultimately about whether or not women are going to retain their current status as full citizens of these United States. 
If the issue were creating sound public policy, then the Senate could vote to enact a bill that I cosponsored with Senators Feinstein and Boxer which sought to ban late-term abortions except in situations in which the life or health of the mother is at risk--a requirement that has been set by the Supreme Court. The legislation we are debating today, however, contains no exception to protect the health of the mother, and an inadequate one with regard to protecting her life. I believe that even the sponsors of this legislation are fully aware that under the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade this bill, as presently written, is unconstitutional. 
I believe the sponsors of the legislation would like to pretend that Roe v. Wade does not exist as the law of the country. That is the only way they can argue that this bill is a constitutional measure. 
But let's look at the facts. In 1973, the Supreme Court of the United States recognized a woman's constitutional right to have an abortion prior to fetal viability. Roe also established this right is limited after viability at which point States may ban abortions as long as an exemption is provided for cases in which her life or health is at risk. These holdings were reaffirmed by the Court in its 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. 
That is the constitutional standard that this legislation has to meet--and it clearly does not. The ban in this bill would apply throughout pregnancy. It ignores the Court's distinction between pre- and postviability. Moreover, this legislation fails to provide an exception in cases in which the banned procedure is necessary to preserve a woman's health. The Supreme Court has clearly stated that such a thing, such a measure is unconstitutional. 
You do not have to be a constitutional scholar to figure that out, although, as professor Laurence Tribe has stated for the record, this legislation is plagued by `fatal constitutional infirmities.' That is also why, Mr. President, courts in 17 out of 18 cases--Federal and State courts; including a court in my home State of Illinois--have ruled that laws similar to this legislation are unconstitutional. 
Mr. President, allow me a moment to look at some of the specifics of the bill. First, I would like to examine the ban's exception to save the life of the mother. Under this legislation, the banned procedure may be performed if a mother's life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury. 
Something is missing here. What if the mother's life itself is endangered by the pregnancy? The legislation is silent with regard to whether an exception exists under those circumstances. If this bill were to become law, the result of a problematic pregnancy could very well be that protecting the life of the fetus--even one capable of living outside the womb on its own for only a few moments--protecting the life of that fetus could result in the death of its mother. 
This element of the bill would be particularly devastating to those women who are poor and/or who live in rural areas and therefore might not have access to the top-quality tertiary kind of health care that can make a difference in a life-or-death situation. There is a difference between women who have access to that kind of quality health care and those many women who do not. 
The simple fact is if the President's veto is overridden, women's lives will not be fully protected in our country. Women fought for generations for the full protections and guarantees contained in our Constitution. It has only been 78 years that we have been granted the right to even vote. With this legislation, we would turn back the clock--for it does nothing less than abridge women's hard-earned status as full citizens of this country. 
Most of the people--and I hate to say this, Mr. President, but it is fact and it must be said--most of the people making the decision to vote on this issue cannot themselves ever experience the trauma of pregnancy or, for that matter, abortion. It is being made by people who themselves are not at risk with regard to this decision. 
Moving beyond the issues surrounding the legislation's unsatisfactory lifesaving exception, I would like to address the bill's total lack of an exception for the health of the mother. In Roe, the Court held that even after a fetus was viable, States could not place the interests and welfare of that fetus above those of the mother in preserving not just her life, but her health as well. 
Under this bill, women's health would be a complete nonissue. Certain procedures developed in the years since Roe v. Wade to protect pregnant women's health would be unavailable to our physicians, our doctors. So this legislation would simply turn us back to the status of the law as it existed before Roe v. Wade, a time when more than twice as many women died in childbirth as do today. 
I want to give you some numbers here, Mr. President. I think it is important to put this in historical perspective as well. At the turn of the century, the death rate in childbirth for women--childbirth was much more dangerous than it is today --but the rate of mothers dying was 600 women per 100,000 live births. By 1970, medical advances had brought that rate down to 21.5 women for every 100,000 live births. That is the point at which Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Court. Today, that number is less than 10 per 100,000 live births. 
We expect that women are going to survive a pregnancy, complicated or not. That was not the expectation 100 years ago. It was not even the expectation 20 years ago. The fact of the matter is, that in addition to the medical advances, the ability of physicians to make these kinds of judgments, and women being able to choose, in consultation with their doctors, has served to protect the health as well as the lives of women. 
Again, under this bill, women's health will be a complete nonissue. Procedures that have been developed since Roe v. Wade would be made unavailable. Thus, we would be turning back the clock. The Supreme Court said in abortion rulings that a woman has a constitutionally protected right to protect her own health at every stage of her pregnancy. Therefore, I submit that the bill's lack of an exception to preserve the health of the mother, like its incomplete lifesaving provision, would strip women of fundamental rights that are guaranteed to them under the Constitution. 
Now, while the term partial-birth abortion is not a medical term--and I think that has been debated and everybody knows that--a procedure that certainly would be banned under this bill is a procedure known as intact dilation and extraction, or intact D&E. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which represents over 90 percent of this Nation's OB/GYNs, opposes this bill. They said:  
The potential exists that legislation prohibiting specific medical procedures, such as intact D&E, may outlaw techniques that are critical to the lives and health of American women. 
They are absolutely correct. If this legislation were to become law, women's health would be jeopardized because doctors would be forced to use abortion procedures that may not be the best or the most appropriate for a particular woman. 
As was eloquently stated by the speaker before me, Congress presumes to substitute its judgment for the judgment of physicians or doctors in regard to medical practice with this legislation. There can be no denying the fact that if the President's veto is overridden, we will be sending a message that women should be allowed to suffer irreparable harm due to pregnancy even though their doctors have the ability to have prevented that harm. 
In opposing this legislation, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also stated: 
The intervention of legislative bodies into medical decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill-advised, and dangerous. 
That is precisely right. Politicians should have nothing to do with this issue. We have no place in the examining room, operating room, or the delivery room. The question of how to deal with the pregnancy should rest squarely with the pregnant woman, her doctor, her family, her God, and not with Members of the U.S. Congress. 
Some have argued that we have a responsibility to get involved and ban the procedure because it is not safe. In my view, it is physicians, not Senators, who should be the ones to make that decision. It is their job to do so, not ours. 
Some have argued that the procedure to be banned is unnecessary, and yet the legislation contains an exception to save the life of the mother. That exception is there because of the undeniable fact that in some circumstances the procedure addressed by this legislation is necessary--sometimes to protect a woman's health, sometimes to protect her life. But we don't have to look at the bill to know that. Physicians have repeatedly stated this is the case. 
What all of this tells me is that this is essentially a medical matter. Doctors must have the freedom to be able to decide which procedures to use in cases of a troubled pregnancy. To the extent that this Congress limits their freedom of action, their freedom of decision, we put the lives and health of women at risk. Consider what the effect of risking women's health in this way could mean for family life in the United States. The inability to address one's own reproductive health as a woman and her doctor believe is necessary, increases the possibility that a woman's reproductive system could be irreversibly damaged and she would be unable to bear children for the rest of her life. Other effects of such a pregnancy on her health may leave a woman unable to care for the children she is already raising. 
All of this should make clear that this legislation poses a mortal threat to the ability of women to make choices about their own bodies and their own futures that all Americans ought to be able to make as essential and fundamental freedoms. Choosing to terminate a pregnancy is the most personal, private, and fundamental decision that a woman can make about her own health and her own life. Essentially, choice equates to freedom. The right to choose goes straight to the heart of the relationship of a female citizen and her doctor. Choice is a barometer of equality and a measure of fairness. I believe it is central to our liberty as women. 
Now, having said that, I do not personally favor abortion as a method of birth control. My own religious beliefs hold life dear. I would prefer that every potential child have a chance to be born. But whether or not a child will be born must be its mother's decision--not Congress', not ours. 
I fully support the choice of those women who carry their pregnancy to term regardless of the circumstances. Some women have died having made a decision that turned out to have been ill-advised under the circumstances. But I also respect the choice of those women who, under very difficult circumstances in which their life and health may be endangered by a pregnancy, choose not to go forward with it. So, while I would like to live in a society where abortions never happen, I also want to live in a society in which they are safe and they are legal. 
I am going to put aside for a moment the abstract arguments in favor of sustaining this veto, and bring us back to the real-life situations. I read one letter. The last time I spoke on this issue I related the story of Vikki Stella who lives in Naperville, IL. Vikki has a story as heart-wrenching as the one I started with when I began my remarks on this issue. 
I won't go through the details of Vikki's case right now because, frankly, I don't believe aggravating the emotions on this issue serves any good purpose at this point. We have people who have clear disagreement in regard to these situations. I am sure there are stories that can be told for the rest of this day. I, frankly, believe that while the stories illustrate, they should not be used to aggravate or to inflame passions on this issue. 
I think it is important for us to remember that for every story of a woman who made the choice and it came out all right, there is another story of a woman who made the choice and it didn't come out all right. I think it is inappropriate for those of us in this room to force those women to die, or alternatively, to lose their reproductive health because of our intervention in their personal and private decisions. 
I urge my colleagues to respect the decisions of these women, to respect their freedom as citizens, to respect their fundamental rights as citizens of this great country and give them the respect that goes with the notion that ultimately people want to do the right thing, ultimately people want to choose life, ultimately people want to do the right thing by their children, and that we in this Congress should allow those decisions to be made by women and their physicians in consultation with their family and their God. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I appreciate my colleague allowing for that exception in interpreting her situation in that way. 
But I think, if anything, my colleague's argument goes exactly to the heart of my position in this matter, which is that we are forcing physicians to consult the language of this bill in making that kind of a judgment about what kind of procedure is appropriate for which woman in what circumstance. 
If a physician has concerns, as you just said, by making an injection, killing the fetus in utero, and then delivering it, falling outside of the exception, well, if that is the case, then I appreciate my colleague making legislative history. 
I think, if anything, it points to the fallacy of the nonphysicians in this Chamber making these kinds of medical judgments.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Again, I know we have irreconcilable differences of opinion about this, but I think it is important to remember that, as we legislate, we are legislating in broad strokes, not in specifics. The problem with this bill, as I have said in my debate, is that one size does not necessarily fit all. Frankly, talking about when her baby's heart stopped, that is not an exact definition of death, either. Those are my words, colloquial terms. We are not physicians. That is the problem. To hamstring and say to a physician that you can make decisions about this, except here, here, here and here will, by definition, cause them to, frankly, shy away from exercising their best medical judgment. We are not physicians and one size does not fit all. That is why I believe the President's veto of this bill was appropriate and correct. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today, 39 of my olleagues and I are sending a letter to the Senate Majority Leader, Senator Lott, and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth, urging them to include school modernization tax incentives in any tax legislation considered by the Senate this year. While we may have different positions on the advisability of enacting such legislation, and different positions on what that legislation should include, we are united in believing that any tax legislation must include significant relief for communities seeking to rebuild and modernize their schools. 
This month, according to a recent report from the Department of Education, a record number of students are pouring into our nation's classrooms. 52.7 million children enrolled in elementary and secondary schools this year, a 500,000 student increase from last year. Ten years from now, according to the report, enrollment is expected to reach 54.3 million. We cannot continue to pack these children into today's schools. We need to build an estimated 6,000 new schools over the next 10 years just to keep up with rising enrollment. 
In addition, the U.S. General Accounting Office has documented $112 billion worth of deferred maintenance and neglect of existing school buildings. It will cost $112 billion nationwide--$13 billion in Illinois alone--to bring existing school buildings up to good, overall condition. That is not the cost of equipping them with new computers, or even of retrofitting them so teachers have a place to plug in new computers. That is just the cost of bringing existing buildings up to good, overall condition. 
Crumbling and overcrowded schools are found in every type of community, all across the nation. The GAO found that 38 percent of urban schools, 30 percent of rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools are crumbling down around our children. 
The problem is so pervasive because it is a symptom of our failed school finance structure. For more than 100 years, we have relied on local property taxes to finance our schools. This system may have made sense when the nation's wealth was held and measured in terms of property, but it does not make sense today. 
According to the GAO, our school finance system actually militates against most communities' best efforts to improve their schools. In 35 states, poor districts have higher tax rates than wealthy districts, 
but raise less revenue because of lower property values. 
In 11 states, courts have actually declared school finance systems unconstitutional. In nearly every case, states have complied by raising property or sales taxes to fund school improvements. Similar litigation is pending in another 16 states, and many of these lawsuits appear likely to result in higher state and local taxes as well. 
The Senate has an opportunity this year to break this cycle of crumbling schools and higher local taxes. We have an opportunity to create a new partnership between the federal government, states, and communities to improve our schools. We can do this in a way that does not reduce the projected budget surplus, which is properly being reserved for Social Security, and in a way that maintains continued fiscal discipline. 
In last year's Taxpayer Relief Act, the Congress took the first steps toward the creation of this new partnership, when it enacted the Qualified Zone Academy Bond program. Under this program, school districts issue zero-interest bonds, and purchasers of these bonds receive federal income tax credits in lieu of interest. This mechanism can cut the cost of major school improvements by 30 to 50 percent. In Chicago, the school system will presently issue $14 million worth of these bonds for a school renovation project. By using these bonds instead of regular municipal bonds, the school system will save Chicago taxpayers $7 million in interest costs. In other words, this project will cost $14 million, instead of $21 million. 
I propose that we use the same mechanism to facilitate school improvements nationwide. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, we can supply $22 billion worth of these special bonds to states and communities at a cost of only $3.3 billion to the federal treasury over the next five years. That $3.3 billion cost actually represents tax relief for purchasers of these school modernization bonds. Under this plan, communities get better schools and children get a better education; local property taxpayers and federal income taxpayers get lower bills. This is the kind of innovative partnership we need to rebuild and modernize our schools for the 21st century. 
Last week, President Clinton, Vice President Gore, governors, members of Congress, cabinet members, parents, teachers, and school officials gathered at 84 sites around the country to focus attention on the urgent need to create a new partnership to modernize our schools. Speaking at a school in Maryland, President Clinton said our `children deserve schools that are as modern as the world in which they will live.' He went on to say that, `Nothing we do will have a greater effect on the future of this country than guaranteeing every child, without regard to race or station in life or region in this country, a world-class education. Nothing.' 
That statement could not be more true. The rungs on the ladder of opportunity in America have always been crafted in the classroom, and in the emerging global economy, the importance of education continues to grow. As H.G. Wells noted, `Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.' 
As we approach the 21st century, we are faced with the real problem that too many of our schools do not provide the kind of learning environment necessary to educate our children for a competitive, global economy. Studies have proven a correlation between building conditions, student achievement, student discipline. The fact is, our children cannot learn in schools that are falling down around them. 
I hope the Congress can use the remaining time we are in session, short as it may be, to create a school modernization partnership that will carry our children into the next century. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that our plan is a part of any tax legislation considered this year. 
According to a recent Gallup poll, 86 percent of adults support providing federal funds to repair and replace older school buildings. That figure suggests that the American people want Congress to put aside partisanship and ideology and work together to help improve our schools. I hope we won't let them down.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the Senator from New York. I congratulate and commend the Senator from New York for his leadership in this area. 
Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment to ban ATM surcharges. Over the past two years, the Banking Committee on which I serve has held numerous hearings on this issue. I think it is important to note that every time we have one of these hearings, more studies confirm what we have said all along: the practice of surcharging is anticompetitive, it exploits consumers and it should be banned. 
When I was in law school at the University of Chicago, I was taught that competition in a free market is supposed to be all about lowering prices and providing better services to your customers in order to maintain market share. However, competition in a world of surcharging is like Alice in Wonderland, where nothing is as it should be. Surcharging actually encourages the abuse of a dominant position in the marketplace, promoting predatory prices. Competition in this instance is not about providing the best services for the best prices, rather it is about forcing your rivals out of the marketplace by raising their costs. 
And these costs are spreading. ATM surcharges have soared since 1995, and consumers paid between $2.5 and $3 billion in surcharges last year. This figure is in addition to the almost $1 billion in interchange fees already collected for these same transactions. Seventy percent of all banks currently impose a surcharge, and the most common surcharge has risen from $1 to $1.50 over the last year. 
If current trends continue, few ATMs will remain that have no surcharge, and consumers, despite surcharge warnings most institutions post on the computer screen or on the machine, will truly have no alternative but to be charged twice for the same transaction--especially now that some institutions are surcharging their own customers. 
I am aware that there are some costs to convenience. The number of ATM machines has more than quintupled over the last decade. Americans used ATM machines billions of times last year, accessing their bank accounts and other financial services 24 hours a day, seven days a week. However the practice of surcharging has actually resulted in less convenience for many customers. The result of surcharges is `the incredible shrinking ATM network,' far less convenience, longer searches and longer waiting lines for those who seek to avoid these double fees. As the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded, `to avoid surcharges, many consumers are likely visiting ATMs that are less convenient than those used previously.' I know there are costs associated with deploying these new machines, handling increased transactions, and other maintenance and safety issues. However, consumers are paying quite a bit for the marginal `convenience' of these additional machines. According to David Balto of the Federal Trade Commission, assuming that surcharging has lead to the deployment of 40,000 new ATMs, the more than $2.5 billion in surcharges last year means that customers paid over $60,000 for each new ATM. Furthermore, banks do not just surcharge on new ATMs in remote locations, but on all of their machines. Therefore, many customers who may never use one of these new, remote ATMs pay for the `convenience' of having it exist. 
Moreover, it should not be forgotten that banks moved customers to ATMs because, compared to teller transactions, ATMs were cheaper. According to a 1996 Mentis Corporation study, an ATM cash withdrawal from an in-branch ATM costs an average of 22 to 28 cents, while the cost of a teller transaction is 90 cents to $1.15. And in some cases, banks charge customers for completing transactions with a teller if those transactions could have been completed at an ATM. 
Certainly ATMs are a convenience for customers, but the truth is that banks have deployed more ATMs because it means lower costs to banks. 
I remember when banks paid their customers for the use of their money. Today, however, it's increasingly expensive for the average working family to manage even a simple banking account. Americans who make timely credit card payments, or no payments at all, face higher fees. Americans who avoid special banking services are considered unprofitable customers, and face higher fees. 
Now, with ATM surcharges, Americans are discovering that they must pay banks more than an additional $155 each year simply to access their own money. 
The market is out of whack. The public knows this is unfair, and their visceral reaction is a response to market excess. 
I am hopeful that the financial industry will take the necessary steps to remedy this problem. If they do, I do not believe this provision should become law. Banks in some states have demonstrated a willingness to address this issue. I call on the rest of the industry to follow their lead. Otherwise, the government has a duty to correct the abuse of double charging people for accessing their own hard-earned dollars. In an era of unprecedented bank profits, it is clearly a case of greed over need. I strongly support this amendment and urge all of my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. President, there are sound economic reasons why this proconsumer amendment ought to be passed. Whether you care about consumer issues or banks, you ought to support Senator D'Amato's amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor. 
I thank the Chair. I thank Senator D'Amato. I yield the floor.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators Daschle, Biden and Leahy, in introducing the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998. This comprehensive legislation, which will add to the success of the 1994 Crime Bill, is based on a tough, common-sense strategy: Put more police officers on the street, build more prisons for violent offenders, take guns out of the hands of felons, and protect families from the scourge of domestic violence. 
In the wake of the historic 1994 Crime bill, we have seen a dramatic decline in crime rates across the nation. In 1996, we experienced the lowest violent crime rate since 1989. On the whole, the overall crime rate was lower than any year since 1984. And it appears that we will continue in this success: Preliminary figures released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation show that nationwide, serious crime dropped an additional four percent in 1997. 
While these numbers are impressive, recent events have shown that there is still much that must be done in order to equip our nations law enforcement agencies and local communities with the tools they need to address the latest scourge of violence in our schools, in our nation's embassies around the world, and at our borders. This multi-faceted legislation has many well-written, well-thought out proposals which I believe greatly help our nation continue winning the fight against crime and terrorism in our ever-changing world. 
Among the many parts of this legislation, I am most excited about additional funding for continuing the fight against domestic violence. We first took up this issue with the historic passage of the Violence Against Women Act. This legislation, which improves on our commitment to fighting against violence against women, will provide additional grants dedicated to the arrest and prosecution of batterers, shelter for 400,000 abused women and their children, and continued access to the National Domestic Violence Hotline. These initiatives are paramount in ensuring safety from crimes committed within the home. 
And there are other parts of this legislation that I believe are especially poignant given the latest outbreak of violence in our nation's schools. This legislation finally brings the juvenile justice system up to date with the juvenile crime of the day, by giving Federal prosecutors sole, nonreviewable authority to prosecute 16 and 17 year olds as adults when they are alleged to have committed the most serious federal violent and drug offenses. It would also provide grants to States to incarcerate violent juvenile offenders, establish graduated sanctions, and encourage pilot programs to replicate successful juvenile crime reduction strategies. A proposal to further curb the threat of gang violence and crime and to reduce the drug-related crime has also been included in this bill. Finally, this legislation would provide grants for juvenile gun and youth violence courts, and for truancy prevention and comprehensive delinquency prevention activities. 
I am most pleased, however, that this legislation contains two provisions that were included in my Safe Communities and Schools Act, which I introduced early this month. That legislation, which has been incorporated into this bill, will help put an additional 25,000 police officers on the street and create new grants under the COPS program for school and local law enforcement efforts against school-yard violence. 
As you know, the COPS program has played a vital role in reducing our nation's crime rate. Since inception of the program in 1994, the Department of Justice has authorized an additional 76,000 police officers to walk the beat. These additional police officers have been instrumental in helping reduce crime and making people feel safe in their communities. 
For example, in my home state of Illinois, the COPS program, which has put 4,113 police officers on streets across the state, has been extremely effective. Between the time that the Crime Bill was passed and the end of last year, serious crime fell by 17 percent. Recent statistics show that for the first six months of 1998, serious crime throughout Illinois is down 2.8 percent over 1997. 
Despite the positive gains that have been made in the wake of the 1994 Omnibus Crime bill, the latest influx of violence in our nation's schools is evidence that their is still much work to be done. Although we are seeing record reductions in the incident of youth-on-youth crime, the extremely violent nature of crimes now being committed by juveniles is nothing short of stunning. Extending the COPS program and making more funds available to communities to combat school violence will free the hands of local law enforcement and give them the opportunity to develop new and innovative ways of reducing youth crime. 
Finally, this legislation seeks to place reasonable, Constitutional restrictions on gun purchases and gun ownership. It would ban prospective gun purchases by juveniles who have been adjudicated delinquent or convicted of violent crimes and would require gun dealers to make gun safety devices available for sale or have their licenses revoked. It would also impose tougher penalties for possession of guns during the commission of a crime of violence or drug offense. 
Overall, this bill provides a holistic response to the varied nature of crime being committed at home and abroad against American citizens. It is a sensible approach to a devastating problem. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and to push for its immediate passage.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today to bring to the attention of the Senate an event that will take place this weekend in my hometown of Chicago. That event, the Second Annual Chicago Football Classic, celebrates the rich academic, cultural and athletic tradition of historically Black colleges and universities. 
The Chicago Football Classic will take place this year at Chicago's Soldier Field on Saturday, September 12, 1998. This year's competition pits Alcorn State University against Virginia State University in what promises to be an exciting and hard-fought gridiron battle. 
Although the football game is the centerpiece of the event, the Chicago Football Classic is about so much more. Begun last year, the Chicago Football Classic was created by Chicago area businessmen to spread the word within the African-American community about the tremendous opportunities available at historically Black colleges and universities. Aside from the game, the Classic features a spectacular halftime battle of the bands; a luncheon honoring Dr. Clinton Bristow, Jr. and Dr. Eddie N. Moore, presidents of Alcorn State University and Virginia State University, respectively; and a parade in historic Grant Park featuring the Virginia State Marching Marauders and the Alcorn State Sounds of Dynomite. 
Mr. President, I am sure that the members of this body are well aware of the proud legacy and stunning achievements of our nation's historically Black colleges. Nonetheless, I would be remiss if in talking about the Chicago Football Classic, I failed to mention that our nation's historically Black colleges and universities have promoted academic excellence for over 130 years. Although they represent only 3 percent of all U.S. institutions of higher learning, historically Black colleges and universities graduate fully 33 percent of all African-Americans with bachelor's degrees and 43 percent of all African-Americans who go on to earn their Ph.D.'s. 
As so eloquently stated in Fisk University's original charter, historically Black colleges and universities have measured themselves `by the highest standards, not of Negro education, but of American education at its best.' 
Throughout their history, historically Black colleges and universities have produced some of our nation's most distinguished leaders, including the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the late Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, and several current U.S Representatives. These institutions have distinguished themselves in the field of higher education over the years by maintaining the highest academic standards while increasing educational opportunities for economically and socially disadvantaged Americans, including tens of thousands of African-Americans. 
In Virginia State University and Alcorn State University, the Chicago Football has chosen two exceptional universities to participate in this years festivities. Alcorn State, located in Loman, Mississippi, arose from the ashes of the Civil War in 1871 with eight faculty members and 179 mostly male local students. Today, Alcorn State has grown to a population of 3,000 students from all over the world and 500 faculty and staff members. Virginia State University was founded in 1882 in Petersburg, Virginia with 126 students and seven faculty members. One hundred years later in 1982, the University was fully integrated, with a student body of nearly 5,000 and a full-time faculty of about 250. 
Mr. President, both of these schools have a historical connection to the United States Congress. The first president of Virginia State, John Mercer Langston, was the only African-American ever elected to the United States Congress from Virginia until the election of Congressman Robert Scott in 1992. Former Senator Hiram Revels of Mississippi, the first African-American elected to the United States Senate, resigned his seat in this body to become the first president of Alcorn State. 
Certainly, in mentioning these few facts about Alcorn State and Virginia State Universities, I have only scratched the surface of the proud history, academic excellence, and abundant opportunities that historically Black colleges and universities have to offer. 
I salute the organizers, participants, and fans of the Chicago Football Classic for coming together to celebrate historically Black colleges and universities. In the words of Tim Rand, the Executive Director of the Chicago Football Classic: `It offers young people an opportunity to witness the rich cultural heritage of Black colleges and universities.' I am proud that Chicago has been chosen as the venue for this important and exciting event. 
In closing, I would like to welcome the students, athletes, fans and alumni of Virginia State and Alcorn State to Illinois, and wish both teams good luck in Saturday's game. I know my colleagues here in the Senate join me in my praise of the Chicago Football Classic and in my gratitude and respect for our nation's historically Black colleges and universities.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Safe Communities and Schools Act of 1998. This legislation, I believe, will help American communities continue to prevail in their fight against crime, and will arm local law enforcement agencies and schools with the tools they need to fight the recent outbreak of school-yard violence. 
The Community Oriented Policing Program, or the COPS program as it is commonly called, has played a vital role in reducing our nation's crime rate. Since the inception of the program in 1994, the Department of Justice has authorized an additional 76,000 police officers to walk the beat. These additional police officers have been instrumental in helping reduce crime and making people feel safe in their communities. 
It is not coincidental that, in my own home state of Illinois, where the COPS program has put an additional 4,113 police officers on the street, we have experienced a substantial drop in crime in recent years. For example, in 1996--the last year for which statistics are available--crime in Illinois was down 11 percent. 
I strongly believe that the key to the COPS program's success lies in the community policing strategy that is its guiding philosophy. As the daughter and sister of law enforcement officers and a former federal prosecutor, I can attest to the fact that community policing works. Putting beat cops back into communities allows them to have more contact with the people they protect and gives them an opportunity to prevent crimes before they happen. 
But despite the gains that have been made with the advent of the COPS program, the recent spate of violence in our nation's schools is evidence that our crime-prevention efforts are far from complete. Although we are seeing record reductions in youth-on-youth crime, the horrifyingly violent nature of the crimes now being committed by juveniles demands government action. 
For this reason, my legislation would use COPS program grants to establish partnerships between local law enforcement agencies and local school systems. Under my legislation, career law enforcement officers, trained in community-oriented police activities, would be deployed to work in collaboration with schools and community-based organizations to, among other things: Combat crime and disorder problems, as well as gang and drug activities occurring in or around elementary and secondary schools; Educate likely school-age victims about crime prevention and safety; and Assist schools in developing policies to reduce crime. 
Under my legislation, no new funding beyond that which has already been allocated to the COPS program would be required to finance these school-police partnerships. 
By the year 2000, the COPS program will have served to fulfill President Clinton's pledge to put 100,000 new police officers on the street. Currently, the program is only funded through that year, but I believe that it has clearly been successful enough to justify at least a two-year extension. Accordingly, in addition to facilitating new school-police partnership grants, my legislation would authorize that extension and provide the necessary funding to allow local police departments across America to put an additional 25,000 officers on the street. 
Providing funds to communities to combat school violence will give local school systems and law enforcement agencies the opportunity to develop new and innovative approaches to reducing youth crime. It is time to stop wringing our hands over the scourge of youth violence and begin to take action. The American people are demanding leadership on this issue and the time has come for those of us who serve in Washington to provide it. 
If we are truly serious about preparing the next generation of Americans for the challenges they will face in the 21st century's global economy, we must take action--right now--to guarantee that they are educated in a safe environment. That is why I have fought for a partnership between the federal government and state and local school systems to address the disgrace of our nation's crumbling schools, and that is why I am introducing the COPS legislation I have just outlined. We owe the next generation of Americans at least as much as our generation was given--and the fact is that we were given schools that were physically safe and violence-free. 
The success of the COPS program to date demonstrates the wisdom of using it as the vehicle for promoting school safety and for expanding it to put an additional 25,000 officers on community policing beats. The data is in and the results are clear: Community policing works. That is why I am confident that safer schools and safer communities will be the result if the COPS legislation I am proposing today is passed by Congress and signed into law. I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to eliminate the tariffs on two chemicals, TIC-A and TIC-C, used in the production of protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors are critical components of the `cocktail' therapy used for the treatment of the HIV virus that causes AIDS. 
Protease inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment regimen for HIV patients. Since Food and Drug Administration approval in 1996, protease inhibitors have become effective treatments for HIV patients. These treatments reduce the amount of virus in the blood stream of HIV patients to undetectable levels. The result of this treatment regimen is that most patients on the `cocktail' therapy have been able to resume active and productive lives. 
Protease inhibitors are extremely sophisticated molecules and as a result are very difficult to manufacture. In addition, they are most effective only in high doses, making the treatment regimen very costly. Duty elimination of protease inhibitor raw materials, like TIC-A and TIC-C, will help reduce the costs associated with the production of the treatments. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the bill be placed in the Record.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is my privilege to join my colleague from Illinois, Senator Richard Durbin, in recognizing an important milestone in our nation's history of higher education. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the country's largest Catholic university, DePaul University, in my hometown of Chicago. 
One hundred years ago, the Vincentian Fathers founded a college to educate immigrants who were otherwise denied admission to many of the nation's colleges and universities. Today, DePaul University serves a student population of 17,000 young men and women. Over the course of these 100 years, DePaul's growth has been guided by the original mission of the Fathers to foster in higher education a deep respect for the God-given dignity of all persons, and to instill in educated persons a dedication to the service of others. 
From its humble beginnings, DePaul University has grown to become a major educational and economic force in both the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois. The more than 65,000 DePaul alumni who live and work in Illinois are prominent in such diverse fields as law, education, business, music and art. 
Mirroring its hometown of Chicago, DePaul is nationally recognized for the diversity of its faculty and student body. In fact, the University enrolls the largest combined number of African-American and Latino students of any private college or university in Illinois. 
A few of the many areas of study in which DePaul has distinguished itself include the performing arts, education, law, telecommunication and business. The School of Music and Theater also are nationally recognized institutions. The School of Education has provided elementary and high school teachers to many schools throughout the Chicago metropolitan area. Furthermore, on an issue that is very near to my heart, the School of Education has joined forces with the Chicago Public School system in an effort to help develop new and innovative teaching techniques to meet the demands of the 21st century. 
Many of Illinois' finest jurists and lawyers received their training at DePaul University's School of law. The Law School, internationally known for its work on human rights, is currently working with the University's International Criminal Justice and Weapons Control Center in support of the establishment of an International Criminal Court. 
In the field of business, DePaul University has distinguished itself with a nationally ranked graduate school, which is one of the largest in the country, and whose part-time MBA program has received national recognition as one of the country's top ten programs for each of the past four years. Moreover, the School of Computer Science, Telecommunications Information Systems is one of the largest graduate schools of its kind in the United States. 
Mr. President, there are but a few of the many ways in which DePaul University has repeatedly demonstrated its great worth to the State of Illinois and our nation as a purveyor of quality higher education and invaluable academic research. It is important, however, that it be mentioned that DePaul University accomplishes all this while maintaining a strong commitment to high moral ideals and the selfless service to others and to God. 
It is, therefore, right and appropriate that the United States Senate pass this resolution, and join me and Senator Durbin in congratulating DePaul University on its Centennial Anniversary, and in wishing the University much continued success for the next 100 years.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to engage in a short colloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens. 
As I understand it, the committee included $5 million in the Research, development, Test, and Evaluation Navy account of your Fiscal Year 1999 Department of Defense Appropriations bill for continued funding of the Advanced Materials Intelligent Processing Center in Evanston, Illinois. I want to confirm that the intent of the committee was to provide this additional $5 million to continue the activities of the Center in affiliation with the Naval Air Warfare Center in Lexington Park, Maryland, as well as other industrial and governmental partners. This continuation funding will allow the Center first to complete a state-of-the-art resin transfer molding system with all required equipment functionality, monitoring, and intelligent supervisory control, and then to transfer it to the Center's industrial and governmental partners for prove out in a production environment.

Mr. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his clarification on this important matter, and for his leadership with Senator Inouye of the Committee. I would also like to say to my colleagues that I am confident the work of the Center can help reduce the cost of our defense systems through the use of faster, cheaper, and better means of processing composite materials for military hardware. These improvements will provide substantial dividends to the American people.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise today to pay tribute to the passing of Clyde Raymond Barrow. He was a dear friend, a devoted family man, and a committed community member. His life enriched the lives of countless people. I would like to take a few moments to reflect on this special person. 
Clyde Barrow was born on March 3, 1923 in Belize, British Honduras. He passed just a few weeks ago at the age of 75 on July 9, 1998 in Chicago. He is survived by his wife of 54 years, the Reverend Willie Taplin Barrow; his adopted children, Dr. Patricia Carey and John Kirby, Jr.; his two sisters, Avis Barrow McKay and Peggy Barrow Foster; ninety eight Godchildren; many nieces and nephews; as well as friends and relatives too numerous to count. The Barrows are also the parents of Keith Errol Barrow, who preceded his father in death in 1983. 
To Reverend Barrow, and Clyde's surviving family and friends, I wish there was some way that I could lift this burden of loss from your shoulders. We must take comfort in the fact that Clyde lived his life with tremendous courage, dignity, and kindness. Clyde Barrow's life is an example of righteousness for us all to follow. 
Although Clyde Barrow is no longer with us, he has left scores of memories and a legacy of kindness and compassion that will live on forever. He was the strong, silent partner of the little warrior, Reverend Barrow, supporting her in her many civil rights battles and her stewardship of Operation Push. 
A welder by trade, Clyde also labored countless hours to build and strengthen his community by volunteering his considerable time and talents. Clyde's involvement with organizations such as the Doctors Hospital of Hyde Park and the Vernon Park Church of God's MAST (Men Achieving Success and Training) Homeless Ministry represent his well earned reputation as a good Samaritan. As one who cherished children, Clyde Barrow went out of his way to know the name of each child in his church and neighborhood. Without a doubt, Clyde Barrow was the embodiment of the neighbor we all want living next door to us: a rock and a conscious within the community. 
In times such as these, it is comforting to remember the words of our Lord: `Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes with the dawn.' Clyde Raymond Barrow was a fine man, dedicated to his family, his community, and his God. The Barrows are in my thoughts and prayers during this time of sorrow, and I trust that they are in the prayers of the Senate as well.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I, too, share Senator Kohl's concerns and want to be clear that long-standing community service providers engaged in legitimate tax-exempt activities related to their central mission will not be targeted by this study. I am also concerned, however, that some tax-exempt organizations are moving away from their core purpose and that there are legitimate concerns as to whether they are engaging in commercial competition with the for-profit sector. Was it the Committee's intent to address this concerns?

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the tragedy that occurred last Friday here in the Capitol. As all the world now knows, the heart of our democracy was invaded that day by a gunman who opened fire in an area crowded with tourists. Before the melee was over, two Capitol Police officers were dead and an innocent bystander was wounded. 
Even before Friday's events, every Member of this Congress was well aware of how critical the Capitol Police are to the functioning of our democracy. We are here to do the people's business, but the sad fact is that there are those--both at home and abroad--who do not wish us well in our efforts. Instead of the free exchange of ideas central to the concept of democracy, some of those individuals would, if given the chance, express their views through bullets and explosives. The only thing that stands between those individuals and the daily practice of our democratic ideals is the Capitol Police. They are nothing less than the guardians of those ideals--for what meaning would such principles have if they could not be safely exercised? 
On Friday, Officer John Gibson and Officer Jacob J. Chestnut sacrificed their lives defending those principles. An 18-year veteran of the force, Officer Chestnut was serving that day as the Capitol's first line of defense, manning the metal detector designed to keep instruments of violence out of these halls. When the gunman set off the alarm, Officer Chestnut immediately responded, but, tragically, was mortally wounded before he could stop the intruder. Officer Gibson, also an 18-year member of the force, performed several acts of bravery before his death, pushing a French tourist out of harm's way, hiding a congressional staff member under a desk, ensuring 
that Representative Tom DeLay and members of his staff were hidden from danger, and then helping to bring down the gunman in the battle that ultimately cost his life. Before he died, Officer Gibson singlehandedly kept the gunman out of Representative DeLay's office and, in so doing, saved the lives of both the Congressman and his staff. 
Those of us who work here--the Senators, the Representatives, the staff members, the Capitol Police--have lost two members of our congressional family. But it is not only those who work and visit the Capitol who owe an unrepayable debt to those officers--every citizen of the United States is indebted to them. For Officers Chestnut and Gibson died defending an institution that is the very embodiment of all the democratic freedoms that we Americans hold dear. 
Mr. President, our democracy does not exist in a vacuum; it functions in a very dangerous world. For that reason, a system of security has been established in the Capitol to try to insulate the Congress from those who would do it harm while guaranteeing that we remain accessible to the people we serve. On Friday, that system worked. This is `the people's house,' and each year we welcome roughly four million people to it. That is precisely the way it should be. This Capitol--the greatest symbol of democracy of the greatest democratic republic the world has ever known, a building aptly described by President Clinton as `the front door of American civilization'--belongs to the people of the United States, and it must always be open to them. I do not oppose calls for tighter security, but I would take issue with any measure that would make it more difficult for the American people to visit `their house.' 
Mr. President, I am the daughter and sister of police officers. I know the terrible fear that every law enforcement officer's family endures--the fear that when their loved one departs for work, he or she may never return home. It is my good fortune that, throughout my life, I have never seen that fear materialize. Therefore, I cannot claim to have any concept of what the families of Officers Gibson and Chestnut are going through right now. Nevertheless, I want to express my heartfelt sorrow to them. Our prayers are with you and the entire nation will forever be grateful for the heroism and sacrifice that your loved ones made on our behalf.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, this legislation includes critical funding for our nation's airports, roads, mass transit systems, and other transportation. I want to particularly thank the managers of the bill for including funding for Amtrak, and for a number of key projects important to Illinois, including funding for Metra, Metro Link, and the Chicago Transit Authority. 
I am disappointed that the legislation includes an amendment, added last night, that provides for expedited review of court challenges to the DBE program. I hope that the conferees on this bill will see fit to drop this ill-advised and unnecessary intrusion into hundreds years of judicial process.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for shedding light on this debate, because I think it is very important that this debate be put in context and that the whole story be told. The truth is that this debate, reduced to its essentials, really does relate to a fundamental philosophical difference. Either you are for the politics of conflict and anger and `I got mine, too bad for you,' or you understand and appreciate the value of a politics based on cooperation, on finding common ground, and in recognizing that, as Americans, we are all in this together. 
The fact of the matter is, the CRA is not extortion, as, apparently, it was called on this floor this morning. It is a perfect example of coming up with a construct that allows financial service institutions to do good while doing well. I think it is very important for the listening public to understand that this gives money away to no one. These institutions are not giving away money. They are not losing money. They get back every cent. In fact, the loss ratio, to the extent that we have studies on this, the loss ratio for banks doing business under the Community Reinvestment Act is no different. Banks have done no more poorly while under CRA. The Community Reinvestment Act simply provides access to capital for underserved communities. There are those of us who think that is a good thing for America, that that helps everybody, that everybody benefits when we do not have whole sectors of our country, rural areas, inner-city areas--when we don't have whole sectors of our country cut off from capital flows. 
I was going to rise in opposition specifically to the amendment by the Senator from Alabama to this credit union bill. But, really, my remarks have to be directed, I think, at both of the pending amendments, both the amendment of the Senator from Alabama, as well as the amendment of the Senator from Texas. 
Before I speak specifically on the amendment, however, I think it is important to say what a strong supporter I am of the underlying bill, H.R. 1151. I commend and congratulate the Senator from New York as well as the Senator from Maryland for their very good work in resolving the issues that are reflected by the Credit Union Membership Access Act, which was reported out of our Banking Committee by a vote of 16 to 2. The fact is this, the underlying legislation, responds to a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that, frankly, terrified a number of people that they would lose their ability to participate in credit unions. Certainly this legislation will put an end to those fears. 
I believe credit unions play such an important role in the panoply of financial institutions in our country precisely because we have to have ways to make certain that ordinary citizens will be able to access credit and capital, will have someone they can put a face on, who is in the neighborhood, who is part and parcel of the community. Those values, associated with financial institutions, is just as important for our country as making certain that our big banks and our big institutions can compete internationally. We have to do both. We have to have the focus and the attention paid to Main Street, to little towns and communities, to parents who want to send their kids to college, to somebody who wants to borrow for a car, somebody who wants to borrow for a house or whatever their immediate needs are. We have to have those kinds of opportunities in our system of financial institutions or financial services, as well as the big banks and the institutions capable of competing with the European and other industrialized nation's banks that can aggregate huge amounts of capital. 
So I think making certain the credit unions are strong and secure and able to provide access to capital and credit for citizens is a very, very important thing, and, again, I strongly support the effort by the Senator from New York and the Senator from Maryland in hammering out the basis of H.R. 1151, and I support it. 
Having said that, I want to talk specifically about the amendment of the Senator from Alabama as well as, more generally, about the conversation from the Senator from Texas. I sat here, frankly, when my blood wasn't boiling over some of the conversation--actually the Senator from Alabama has a more soothing tone so he doesn't get your blood up as much as might otherwise happen. But it occurred to me it was really important in this debate to tell the listening audience and the general public what actually is going on here, because so much information has been left out of the conversation so far. 
In the first instance, it is important to understand what the Community Reinvestment Act is not. Let's start there. CRA is not `fair lending.' It has nothing to do with race as a specific thing. It is not that. It has to do with geographic distribution of capital, so it relates to communities more than anything else, not so much to individuals. That is important to keep in mind as we talk about CRA, because this debate will continue into next week. 
The second point I think is important to make, again in terms of what CRA is not, CRA is not a giveaway. Every penny comes back--or at least as much as to any other lending institution. It is about loans. It is not a mandated interest reduction. It is not requiring financial institutions go into social work. CRA is not charity. 
As the Senator from Maryland pointed out, the taxpayers put up the money, really, for deposit insurance. We also have a tax exemption with regard, at least, to the credit unions. There are bankers, frankly, who are more than a little annoyed that credit unions have almost a 30 basis point advantage because of the tax exemption that they enjoy. But the tax exemption has been there precisely because we want to make certain that individuals, people in communities, have a chance to go into their neighborhood credit union or credit union associated with their job and borrow money for college or whatever. So there is a basis point advantage that the credit unions get. 
The taxpayers, all of us, all Americans who pay taxes, help make that possible. That happens any time you create a tax exemption from something that ought otherwise be taxed. If we say we are going to tax everything from here to here, from A to D, but we are going to exempt this little part C to D and say, `Because you are doing something we like, we are not going to tax you for that,' that tax exemption, then, has to be made up by everybody else, right? So it becomes what we sometimes call a tax expenditure. When you take something out of A to D, that little part has to be made up if you have to get to D, and that is what happens if we provide for tax exemptions generally. Everybody chips in; everybody participates. 
It should be for that reason, if nothing else, that we recognize that when you talk about policy like this, it really does matter, it really does come down to recognizing we are all in this together, that we all have an investment, that we all share in these policies, and that finding the place for cooperation and common ground makes a lot more sense for our country than, again, finding the points of conflict, of anger, and of `I got mine, too bad for you.' 
Another thing CRA is not, it does not have an explicit credit allocation criteria. There are no bureaucrats. This is another one of the old saws that just get people's blood boiling, `Oh boy, those nasty Federal bureaucrats telling us what to do.' There are no bureaucrats telling the credit unions, the banks or anybody else, how to do their jobs. It is a results-oriented kind of legislation. 
And, in fact, there are, since the 1995 amendments, simply three separate criteria: A lending test evaluates whether or not a bank has a record of meeting the credit needs of its local community. Boy, is that awful. Has the bank met the credit needs of its local community. 
An investment test evaluates how well a bank satisfies the credit needs of its local neighborhoods through qualified community investments that benefit the assessment area. Another horrendous extortion we were hearing about a minute ago. 
Finally, a service test that evaluates how well the needs of the community are being met by the bank's retail delivery systems. 
All of these things go into defining what CRA is about. Again, it is no bureaucrat telling somebody on the front end how to do it, but it is assessing whether or not the decisions were made in the private sector in an appropriate way that would achieve results. 
Another thing that CRA is not is sanctions. Again, this gets to the inflammatory language we heard on the floor about extortion and a gun to the head and all the rest of it. There are no sanctions for poor performance, no explicit sanctions. 
What it does is, the regulators will take an institution's CRA ratings into account in making evaluations with regard to their attempts to expand or merge or otherwise change the way they do business. What you have here then is a modest attempt to provide the basis for community reinvestment, and even that is under attack, again, I think, by some shopworn and already, hopefully, discredited politics that I don't believe the American people care to hear anymore. It is fighting yesterday's battles all over, or, as Yogi Berra would say, `It's deja vu all over again.' 
The amendment of the Senator from Alabama seeks to exempt fully 86 percent of our Nation's banks--that is to say, those with under $250 million in assets--from the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act. This is not the first time he has offered this amendment. In 1995, this very amendment was considered as part of a banking regulatory relief bill. At that time, the Community Reinvestment Act regulations were undergoing revision to make them less burdensome and more effective for banks and customers and consumers and communities. The amendment was unnecessary and counterproductive then. It is even more so now. In addition to failing to relate to anything having to do with the current reality, it fails to make the case that it will help effectuate the goals of the Community Reinvestment Act. 
The attempt to describe the CRA as overly burdensome to banks is not true, has not been true, it is not true. Frankly, the banks themselves have stepped forward to tell us that they believe the CRA is a positive thing that allows them to do good and to do well. 
Let me share for a moment some of the comments by members of the banking industry. 
Alan Morris, commissioner of banks for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Division of Banks and Loan Agencies:  
I would like to dispel any myths which may still exist about CRA, myths which abound not only among some bankers but among many regulators and community groups. CRA makes good business sense. Of the many bank failures which occurred in Massachusetts over the last 3 years, I can assure you that not one is attributable to a bank making too many CRA loans. We tend to forget, after all, that sound loans to people in businesses in an institution's own local community is what CRA is all about. The false assumptions by some that low and moderate income persons are not deserving of or cannot use banking services is harmful to the communities, the institutions and the economy. 
Again, this is something that affects us all. If we don't have capital flows going to all parts of our country, it is kind of like not having blood circulate to your feet. You can either get the blood circulating to your feet, or you can cut it off, or you can walk around in pain and misery. We can decide we are going to look at abandoned communities with boarded-up houses, with no jobs, where people cannot access capital and credit, or we can do something to get the blood pumping into those communities. And that is what the Community Reinvestment Act does. 
Another banker talking about CRA:  
My message is simple: Community reinvestment in low and moderate income communities is good and profitable business. 
Again, doing good and well at the same time. 
Nora Brownell, senior vice president, corporate affairs, Meridian Bank Corporation: 
I want to reiterate the Community Reinvestment Act offers all of us an opportunity to address major economic development and service issues in our environment today. 
The question becomes, What battle are we fighting here? What is going on? Why are we fighting a battle that doesn't exist? Why are we creating an ersatz crisis, or why are we coming up with an ersatz solution in search of a problem if the bankers don't think a problem exists, if the credit unions are happy with the bill as it is? 
I point out the letter from the credit union--what is the quote--they are happy with the bill `as passed by committee.' `As passed by committee' does not mean either the amendment by the Senator from Alabama or the amendment by the Senator from Texas. 
If the credit unions like the bill as it is, if the bankers aren't upset with the Community Reinvestment Act, what then are we talking about and why are we talking about it? I submit to you, I say to my colleagues, that the reason we are talking about it is that some people like to energize conflict and anger as a part of their politics; that some people like to have people mad at each other, because when they get people mad at each other, then they can get their voters particularly angry and their supporters particularly annoyed, and out of that annoyance, they wind up getting political power. That is what I think all of this really comes down to. 
I don't mean to be nasty, and I don't mean to be discourteous to any of my colleagues, but it is just stunning to me that we continue to have a debate about the burdensome nature of the Community Reinvestment Act when the banks themselves aren't complaining about it. 
To say they are not complaining about it because they are scared, because there is a gun at their head, really--that then suggests they are not only not being burdened but they are too cowardly to talk about it. I don't think any of the people who run these institutions are afraid to speak up for their own interests, particularly bankers. This institution has never been known not to listen to bankers. If bankers wanted to complain about something, they could have brought it to the attention of this committee and this institution. They certainly have the power and clout and have never been too shy in other regards when they needed something--when they needed bailing out, when they needed support. This institution has been very responsive to bankers, and I suggest they have not been afraid to show their faces and complain about the Community Reinvestment Act. 
Let's talk a little bit about the history of the CRA. The CRA was passed in 1977 to combat what was called the `redlining' of certain neighborhoods. Redlining refers to the practice of--in some instances, people actually found evidence where red lines were drawn on maps to indicate areas that were off limits for lending. 
The goal of the CRA is to encourage banks to meet the credit needs of their entire communities, including low- and moderate-income areas--nothing more, nothing less. This obligation had its roots, frankly, in the Banking Act of 1935 which required banks to meet the convenience and needs of their communities, and that, of course, was reiterated in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and, of course, the bank charters themselves. 
CRA is not new, really, in that regard. There is precedence in other existing laws with regard to the intent of making certain that banking and that the access to capital and credit are evenly and equitably distributed throughout all communities. 
The CRA does not require any banks to make bad loans. It only asks them to explore good loan possibilities in their entire market area. CRA opens new markets and allows banks, again, to do good while doing well. 
Now, it is critical, again, to keep in mind what it is and what it is not. It is not an effort to treat banks as if they were arms of the Government. It does not set up banks and financial institutions as social service agencies. It is not about treating them as an equivalent of a Government grant. This is not giving money away to anybody. It is not a credit allocation. It is not forcing somebody to give credit to a particular group or particular community in a particular way. And it certainly is not about minorities. 
I certainly hope that nobody gets away with demonizing the Community Reinvestment Act on the basis of race, or demonize it, frankly, on the basis that it is for inner-city communities because it is not. It is about communities all over the country, and particularly in rural communities. Actually, rural communities in some instances are more challenged than our inner-city and urban areas in terms of getting access to capital and credit. 
It is especially important to preserve the CRA obligations for rural banks when often they are the only game in town for credit purposes. Several years ago, our Banking Committee held some CRA oversight hearings and we discovered cases of small banks in which the service area consisted of two towns, each with a population of about 10,000. The bank in that case was found to be in substantial noncompliance with CRA because its loan portfolio consisted of only 5 percent of the total assets of the bank. 
Now, again, 5 percent--you say, how could that happen? You have a bank in a little town. Why would it give only 5 percent of its loans in the town? Well, in some instances the investments are in Treasuries and other things like that which wind up being more profitable for the bottom line, but it certainly does not serve the interests of the community. And that is not where banking laws--again, going back to 1935--that is not where the banking laws want to take us. Frankly, that does not in any way reflect or relate to or in any way show support back for the kind of support that taxpayers and citizens overall give to these financial institutions. 
The last time the efforts were made to exempt small banks from the CRA--I am speaking specifically to the amendment by the Senator from Alabama--there was an article that appeared in the Madison Capital Times in Wisconsin. It is `Bank measure bad for farms.' Referring to that amendment, the very same amendment, this article, `Bank measure bad for farms' presents the view of a concerned rural resident who was concerned about the unpainted barns and boarded-up rural businesses that she saw in her community.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. The author stated in the article: 
As in all communities, rural citizens need credit. When farmers, other small businesses, and rural citizens deposit their money in their local bank, they do so both to protect their funds and with the hope that when they want to start a new business or bring a new family member into their farm operation, the local bank will, in turn, lend them money. 
But sometimes banks, and especially many rural banks, establish a very different pattern, where local lending takes a lower priority than making more assured investments, like Federal Government securities. Thus, such banks drain local resources outside of the very localities that support them, making it that much harder for local citizens to get credit. 
She goes on--by the way, I do not know how many people who are listening to me now got a chance to hear the earlier comments about the nasty Federal Government, but, again, here this lady is saying they are taking money out of home localities in rural communities and investing them in Federal Government securities. 
She goes on to describe how the Community Reinvestment Act spurred one bank in particular to increase its commitment to agricultural and small businesses. And I quote. She says: 
. . . in rural areas, where often there is little competition among banks, it's wrong to revoke one of the few accountability measures citizens have. 
Mr. President, I believe that she is exactly right. Even if banks under $250 million represent a small percentage of total banking assets, they still represent 100 percent of options for many small town residents. 
To go back to the article, the author also writes: 
If rural communities are to regain the vitality their citizens deserve, they need true help and meaningful solutions. Permitting banks free rein in the name of regulatory relief is not one of them.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. In addition, I have received many letters from community groups and other concerned citizens who oppose this amendment. 
I must point out that, again, in 1995, when this amendment was proposed before, letters were sent in opposition by the Save CRA Coalition and others. Unlike many of the special interest groups around here in Washington, frankly, that group's name lets you know exactly what it stands for. The Save CRA Coalition was established to defeat the amendment of the Senator from Alabama when it was previously offered. 
The letter they sent, opposing the weakening of the CRA, was signed by 2,181 State and local government organizations, for-profit businesses, community groups, unions, farm groups and faith-based organizations from every State in the country, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, by the way, including a number of organizations from Alabama and Texas.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. One of the reasons that CRA has such broad support is very simple. It does not force banks to make bad loans. It encourages them to examine unexplored markets in their service area, and it, again, allows a financial institution to do good while doing well simultaneously. They make money on these loans. 
My favorite CRA story is about one banker who said that he hated the CRA, but he did not think it was burdensome. What he hated was the fact that other banks did it, too. Other banks were complying with CRA. He had discovered years ago--it was kind of a market rating situation--he discovered years ago that there were many cash-poor but credit-worthy customs out there. And he had previously been the only one issuing loans in certain low- and moderate-income areas in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. 
So now with CRA in place, he was forced to compete where he had once enjoyed a monopoly. And so he was annoyed, if you will, that his monopoly over the areas that had not had access to capital and credit, except via him--that that monopoly was now opened up because other institutions were beginning to engage in those communities, because and by virtue of the Community Reinvestment Act. 
Again, he had learned a lesson that many bankers are now learning. Because of CRA, community reinvestment is the best way to do good while doing well simultaneously. And CRA is profitable for banks. In a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas, 98 percent of banks found that their CRA activities were profitable. 
Many others agree with the Kansas City study. Most major banks, including NationsBank and Bank of America, have reiterated their commitment to the CRA. As I recall, when we last had a hearing in the Banking Committee, some bankers testified in favor of keeping CRA intact. In fact, I was delighted at a hearing we had of the Banking Committee. Secretary Rubin had previously come out in support of the CRA, but I actually put the question to Chairman Greenspan, who is acknowledged as the guru of financial everything, I guess, and Chairman Greenspan reiterated or spoke to his support of the CRA, which I was absolutely delighted about. 
I will give an earlier statement of Chairman Greenspan: 
When conducted properly by banks which are knowledgeable about their local markets, CRA can be a safe, sound, and profitable business. CRA has prepared financial institutions to discover new markets that may have been underserved before. 
I see a number of my colleagues standing and looking at me. I think this means I am talking too long. I don't mean to filibuster this issue. I just want to say I believe I have spoken to the issue. There are facts and figures I would like to share with my colleagues, but I know we will have another opportunity to do that because we will have this issue come up again on Monday. 
Suffice it to say that expanding the Community Reinvestment Act to the credit unions, which apparently the Senator from Texas doesn't like very much, is not something which has the credit unions themselves riled up. They like the bill we passed out of committee. They don't want to have that amendment. They want to see us go forward with H.R. 1151. 
With regard to the CRA-gutting attempt, taking out 85 percent of CRA activity that the Senator from Alabama would suggest, I submit that also is an amendment that the credit unions don't want to see on this bill because it is too important to them. 
With regard to just an overall appeal to my colleagues, let me suggest that to find a solution like these two are suggesting in search of a problem does not do justice to the level of the cooperation that we have seen in this Congress, and particularly with this Banking Committee, that CRA gives us an opportunity to find common ground, to work together, and to work together for the good of our entire country. The alternative is an appeal to conflict and anger which I think is beneath the Senate. I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing both of these amendments. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to honor Mr. Clark Burrus, a distinguished professional and a citizen par excellence. Mr. Burrus has recently announced his retirement from First Chicago Capital Markets, Inc. Although it was with great sadness that I heard of Mr. Burrus' retirement, this milestone provides an opportune moment to praise him for his long record of achievements. He has served Chicago and our nation in so many different ways that it is almost impossible to enumerate them all. 
Mr. Burrus was born in Chicago and attended Englewood High School on the city's South side. Following high school, Mr. Burrus matriculated at Texas State University where he excelled in both academics and athletics. After his studies at Texas State University, Mr. Burrus returned to his hometown and continued his education at Roosevelt University, where he received both a Masters Degree in Public Administration and a Bachelor of Science Degree in Accounting. 
Clark Burrus began his five decades of service to the City of Chicago during the administration of Mayor Martin Kenelley, and continued to serve under Mayors Richard J. Daley, Michael Bilandic and Jane Byrne. The hard work and dedication of Mr. Burrus were recognized when the late Mayor Richard J. Daley named him City Comptroller in 1973. As City Comptroller, Mr. Burrus was the Chief Fiscal Officer of the city and supervised the Department of Finance. Under his able guidance, the status of city-issued bonds climbed to its first Double-A rating. Mr. Burrus is also credited with engineering the low-interest rate mortgage revenue bond program of Chicago, the first such program in the United States. 
In 1979, Mr. Burrus left public life and joined the First Bank of Chicago as a Senior Vice President in the Asset and Liability Management Department. Almost twenty years later, Mr. Burrus has risen to the position of Vice Chairman of First Chicago Capital Markets, Inc., a subsidiary of First Chicago NBD Corporation. Mr. Burrus also serves as the head of the Public Banking Department. The departments under the supervision of Mr. Burrus provide critical commercial banking services to a wide array of fields, including health care, higher education, governmental and cultural institutional markets. 
Although he left public life in 1979, Mr. Burrus's commitment to the welfare of his hometown and fellow citizens did not end. Mr. Burrus has since served as Chairman of the Board of the Chicago Transit Authority and of its Deferred Compensation Committee. Additionally, Mr. Burrus was a board member of the Regional Transportation Authority, a member of its Strategic Planning Committee, and a member of the Chairman's Coordinating Committee. Recently, Mr. Burrus was appointed to the Cook County Deferred Compensation Committee. He is also a current member and past chairman of the Chicago Transit Authority's Pension Board of Trustees, and has served as a trustee of five other public pension funds. In addition, Mr. Burrus presently serves on a remarkable twenty eight boards and commissions. I never cease to be amazed at how well Clark Burrus is able to perform so many professional and civic duties simultaneously. 
Mr. President, the civic service and public achievements of Mr. Clark Burrus are of breathtaking dimensions. Indeed, they serve as an enduring testament of his passionate commitment to the betterment of his community. As Mr. Burrus retires to private life, he leaves behind a record of excellence that will long be appreciated, and is model of service for all Americans to follow. I wish him Godspeed and hope that his years of retirement will be as enriching as his years of public service.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the amendment by the Senator from Kentucky. But at the outset, I want to point out that inasmuch as this amendment came, we haven't had a chance to go back and check citations and check the references that he made in the speech. However, I would point out that at the outset, the simple and obvious undisputed fact is that the Governor of Kentucky does not like the idea of there being any disadvantaged business enterprise law in this great country, and wants very much to see it repealed. This amendment is no more and no less than a subterfuge for that. Frankly, as far as I can determine, it will effectively tie up the consideration of this legislation. 
I tried to listen as closely as I could to the Senator from Kentucky in his argument with regard to the reasons for the expedited consideration. 
I would point out that our Constitution provides a process, a procedure, for judicial review of legislation passed by this Congress, not the least of which requires the handling of a case in controversy. Those constitutional requirements and those procedures have been in place really since, I would say, the founding of this country. But that probably is not true. Marbury v. Madison was probably the first case in which the ability of the judiciary to determine the constitutionality of an act of Congress was upheld. And I think the precedent goes back to that. 
The Senator from Kentucky wants to have this Senate say that the procedure that has stood in very good stead for the consideration of all the legislation that we have passed over the last couple hundred years is not good enough when the issue is race; that it is not good enough when the issue is gender; and, that is not good enough when the issue is providing some avenue for bringing people into the main stream of our American economy who had heretofore been excluded from it. 
I point out that the DBE is shorthand for Disadvantaged Business Enterprise. It is in the first instance a business enterprise. It says that of the contracting that takes place in transportation, it is only right, it is only fair, that women, that minorities--and minorities meaning a whole range of people--have an opportunity to participate as equal partners in the conduct of business for the development of the Nation's transportation system. This is not anything, or this should not be anything dramatic. This shouldn't, frankly, rattle any cages, particularly when one considers that the amount of contracting the last time I looked was less than 5 percent for women and for minorities. 
When you think about that, you are talking about women being roughly half the population of this country and minorities as roughly another 40 percent or 30 percent of this country. So the majority of the population is allowed an opportunity to participate at a minority level in contracting under the Department of Transportation by virtue of this Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Act. It has obviously been a matter of controversy precisely because it speaks to open the door to women, it speaks to open the door to minorities, it speaks to 
Federal contracting activity under the auspices of, again, the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise section of ISTEA, which is the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act. 
This has been a controversy to the extent that the Supreme Court has already taken the issue up in another context at least with regard to a State court law in the Adarand v. Pena case. 
In the Adarand v. Pena case, the Supreme Court said that the Federal Government must subject affirmative action programs to `strict scrutiny,' meaning that the programs must be `narrowly tailored' to meet a `compelling government interest.' 
The Court explicitly in that case stated that affirmative action is, in fact, still necessary. It wrote, and I want to quote from the Adarand case: 
The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and the government is not disqualified from acting in response to it. 
I will even take issue with that part of the dicta in the case in that the DBE law, the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise law, applies not just to racial minorities; it applies not just to ethnic minorities, but applies to women as well. 
So we have a situation in which individuals who, because of their situation, their status, their station in society, had not been previously able to do business, start out with something of a disadvantage, and it is for that reason that the program was initiated to correct that imbalance to bring some fairness, to bring some equity, to bring some fair share of the spending of Federal contracting dollars with the majority-minority community. 
I say again, `majority-minority' community, because when you add women and African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, all of the different groups included in the definition, the last time I looked, when you add all of the minority groups, when you add women, you are really talking about a majority of the population of this country. The DBE, Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, section of the law allows them to participate in the transportation equity, in the Department of Transportation funding. 
The question is, Why are we here to talk about this amendment? What does this amendment do, and why does it seek to do it? Well, what this amendment says is that the minute someone comes in and says, `Oh, my goodness, I don't think that this is constitutional,' that the case has to be expedited; that the district court advance, expedite over everything else. 
That means, then, that if you are a district court judge, and someone comes in with a case that says, `Ah-ha. I think that the program that is giving this female contractor the asphalt paving contract in my State, I think that is illegal.' Then your case goes ahead of the murder cases on the docket; your case goes ahead of the drug cases on the docket; your case goes ahead of the antitrust cases on the docket; your case goes ahead of the civil rights cases on the docket; and your case goes ahead of everybody. 
We have to ask ourselves: Does this make any sense at all? Why is there such an egregious harm? What devastating occurrence has taken place that would give this claim a right to overcome everything else on a court's docket and make it go directly to the Supreme Court? Do not pass go, do not take advantage of the procedures that have been placed literally, in many instances, since the founding of this Republic. 
The Senator from Kentucky apparently thinks that opening up the door and allowing women and allowing minorities to have some part of the business enterprise of this country is just that egregious an occurrence that it ought to take precedence in its ability to be challenged in the courts; that we ought to throw aside hundreds of years of precedents in court, hundreds of years of procedure in order to make certain that a claim of this magnitude goes directly to the Supreme Court, and has an opportunity to be heard immediately before anybody else has the right to get protected. 
I submit to my colleagues that the logic of this amendment is what fails it the most. It is simply not logical to put aside everything else on a court's docket to avoid the court of appeals altogether, to take this dramatic move to redress what injury. What injury? I think the Senator from Kentucky fails to demonstrate the injury. The Senator from Kentucky also fails to talk about what standing, what case or controversy, what issue would give rise again to the need to undo all of the procedures associated with the challenging of the constitutionality of cases in the courts of this country. 
So what this amendment really is about is attacking the legality of the DBE set-aside program through the side door. Would that it be through the back door, it would be even more direct. But this goes through a side door and takes with it the integrity of the court's procedures. This goes through a door that says, `Whenever we don't like something in this Congress, we can just change the law and change the relationship between the courts and the executive branch and the legislative branch willy-nilly as we see fit and come up with a brand new procedure that we create out of whole cloth.' 
That is what this amendment does. It creates from whole cloth a process of appeal for a set of circumstances, again, the injury of which, frankly, escapes me, and I think escapes a number of our colleagues. 
I would point out that the front-door attack on the DBE Program failed, failed by 58 votes during the ISTEA debate, and it was, frankly, a very good thing, in my opinion. I understand the Senator from Kentucky and I see these things differently, but in my opinion it was a very good thing that a number of our colleagues recognized they would have to go home and explain to all of the women who had wanted to do business with the Department of Transportation the door was slammed in their face, and that wasn't a good thing. Then they would have to go home and explain to all of their minorities, be they racial minority or ethnic minority, why the door was slammed in their face. And that would not be a good thing. 
The amendment was defeated in the front-door attack, and so now the Senator from Kentucky has developed a way to come at it sideways by saying, We are not going to ourselves repeal it, or attempt to repeal it, because we cannot repeal it; we are not ourselves going to take on straight forward the legality or the propriety of the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program, and we are not going to go in the back door, either. We are going to get in the side door. We are going to let anybody out there who might want to take up this cudgel for us, who might want to play politics in the courts for us, we are going to give them an opportunity to do it, and we are going to let them do it in an expedited way. 
Well, let me suggest that this is not a place where new judicial procedures ought to be supported. There is no reason for this new set of procedures or for this new expedited appeals process. This controversial amendment does not belong on this bill because, quite frankly, I believe this amendment in and of itself would be enough to bring down this bill. I don't think the Senator from Kentucky or anybody else wants to see something as important as this legislation go down over this novel, creative, innovative, imaginative, interesting but bizarre, legal procedure that is being suggested by the Senator from Kentucky. 
I have just received a note from the ranking member, and I don't know if he wants to say something or not, but, in any event, I certainly will defer to him and his leadership in this area. He has been exemplary over time. 
Mr. President, I plead with the Senator from Kentucky to refrain from the controversy that is about to be visited on this very important legislation. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to a national health epidemic that kills 40,000 American men every year and strikes hundreds of thousands more each year--prostate cancer. I am concerned about this disease and its impact on American men, particularly its disproportionate impact on African-American men. 
For too long prostate cancer has been a silent killer. Too little has been known about it. Too little was said about it. Too little has been done about it. Fortunately, in recent years many prominent national figures like Senator Bob Dole, General Norman Schwarzkopf, Arnold Palmer, Sidney Poitier, Andy Grove, and Harry Belafonte have come forward to discuss their personal battles with prostate cancer. The admirable leadership of these men and others has helped educate the country about the importance of screening and early diagnosis of prostate cancer, and the need for all of us to do more to fight this disease. 
Mr. President, prostate cancer is the most commonly occurring non-skin cancer in the United States. In 1997, more than 200,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 41,800 died of the disease. Every three minutes a new case of prostate cancer is diagnosed and every 13 minutes someone dies from the disease. While it is often thought to be an older man's disease, younger men are increasingly diagnosed with prostate cancer. In fact, about 20 percent of prostate cancers are now occurring in men between the ages of 40 and 60. 
Although prostate cancer accounts for approximately 20 percent of all new non-skin cancers, it receives less than four percent of federal cancer research funding. In 1996, approximately the same number of lives were lost due to prostate cancer breast cancer and AIDS. In 1997, however, while prostate cancer deaths continued to rise, deaths due to breast cancer and AIDS declined. Nevertheless, the federal commitment to prostate cancer research has not even kept pace with these other priorities. 
Clearly, I am not advocating reduced funding for breast cancer or AIDS research programs. I have been one of the major champions of breast cancer and AIDS research funding. Rather, I use these comparisons to make the point that much more must be done to address the prostate cancer epidemic as well. How can we face the hundreds of thousands of men and their families who are daily affected by prostate cancer knowing, for instance, that more money was spent to make the movie Titanic--more than $200 million--than was spent in 1997 by the federal government for prostate cancer research--only $120 million. 
The possibility and the fear of developing prostate cancer is common to all men. One in five American men will develop prostate cancer during his lifetime. As frightening as that statistic may be for the general population, it is even more pointed in the African-American community. African-American men have a prostate cancer incidence more than 30 percent higher than for any other ethnic groups in this country and the highest in the world. 
The prostate cancer mortality rate for African-American men is more than twice that of white American men. Researchers do not yet know why this is true and do not yet have answers to these and the many other questions about prostate cancer. For example, it is not clear which prostate cancer patients will benefit from traditional treatments, like surgery or radiation. The economic status of many African-American men, and limited access to medical counseling further complicated treatment decisions. 
Those who are devoted to relieving the burden of prostate cancer in the African-American community, including scientists, health care providers, national organizations, community leaders, and survivors alike, are united in their desire to find answers to these questions. I am particularly pleased with the leadership of many national organizations in informing the country about the impact of prostate cancer in the African-American community. In November of last year, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sponsored A Leadership Council on Prostate Cancer in the African-American Community. In cooperation with the Intercultural Cancer Council, the National Black Leadership Initiative on Cancer, the National Prostate Cancer Coalition and the 100 Black Men of America, the Leadership Conference proposed a blueprint for action that aims to solve the problem of prostate cancer in the African-American community.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. The compelling case this letter makes for dramatic increases in funding for prostate cancer research brings me to the last point I want to make. This Congress, this country, must do better. We must do more in the fight to bring a cure for prostate cancer. 
Just last year alone, the National Prostate Cancer Coalition identified more than $250 million of worthwhile prostate cancer research that was not conducted due to lack of funding. This inadequacy in funding is an unconscionable neglect of men with prostate cancer and their families. There needs to be an increased commitment to prostate cancer research. 
In June, President Clinton announced the release of $60 million for prostate cancer research grants in a promising new Department of Defense program modeled after the very successful DoD breast cancer program. Yet, the House has proposed to cut 75 percent of the funding for this important cancer research program. The House position will virtually kill a program that is critical to finding breakthroughs and a potential cure. The current Senate position also shrinks research funding for this program to $40 million. Instead, we should increase the funding to at least $80 million in order to maintain this ground breaking research program. 
While it is also important to increase the amount of prostate cancer research conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the Congress must not neglect the Department of Defense prostate cancer research program. We must not dash the hopes of prostate cancer patients, their families, and their supporters. As is the case with the DoD's breast cancer efforts, this program supports targeted research that complements the work of the NCI and is a necessary component of an overall national effort to find effective treatments for this disease. 
Mr. President, to do anything less would send a devastating message to the men living and dying from this disease, to their families, and to the scientific community that is working to find a cure. I call on this Congress to equip researchers with the tools they badly need to end this epidemic. For the one million Americans currently diagnosed with prostate cancer and their families, increased research funding is desperately needed now. Each day, more and more people will be affected. We cannot turn a deaf ear to their cries for help. It is time for the country and the Congress to make a commitment to equity in funding for prostate cancer research. It is time for us to give the researchers the resources they need to eradicate this silent killer.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Madam President, my colleague from Illinois is exactly correct. TARP is a network of underground tunnels and reservoirs designed as an outlet for sewage and floodwaters during large thunderstorms. For almost two decades, the TARP system has slowly grown, gradually improving flood prevention system in Chicago. Without TARP, local sewage and rainwater drainage would have no where to go when large storms hit the area. 
Already, TARP has greatly reduced contaminated flooding of basements, polluted backflows into Lake Michigan, and to the amazement of many, has markedly improved the water quality of the Chicago River, a feat thought to be impossible a decade ago. Although TARP is largely complete, federal funds are still needed to finish the system and complete the commitment that the federal government made to this project years ago. 
Chicago desperately needs additional capacity to stop this flooding. Without TARP, homeowners and residents in the greater Chicago region will continue to experience serious economic and health hazards from flooding during severe thunderstorm events.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, earlier today I voted for Senator Grassley's Sense of the Senate amendment that urges prompt action on a number of trade, tax, and regulatory issues in order to help the American farm community. I think our farmers are experiencing serious problems, and I believe that prompt action on many of the initiatives contained in the Grassley amendment will help expand U.S. agricultural export markets and improve farm profits. 
The amendment Senator Grassley put before the Senate recommended that the Senate act on S. 2078, the Farm Ranch Risk Management Act, which I have cosponsored. It urges action to provide full funding for the International Monetary Fund; I believe action to increase the capital of the IMF is essential to address the economic crisis in Asia and the current situation in Russia, both of which have enormous impacts on U.S. agriculture. It urges Congressional approval legislation to continue normal trading relations with China, which I also support. It calls for estate tax reform, reduced regulations on farmers, and use of the Commodity Credit Corporation and Export Enhancement Program at the Department of Agriculture, all of which are worthy of prompt attention by the Senate. 
Notwithstanding my support for the general objective of Senator Grassley's amendment, however, I do have one major reservation concerning his amendment, and that has to do with fast-track trade negotiating authority. 
Senator Grassley's amendment urges providing the President with new fast-track negotiating authority. I oppose giving the President that authority at this time, for both practical and philosophical reasons. As a practical matter, fast-track, and any agreements it might ultimately lead to, will only provide benefits to American agriculture in the distant future, not in the near term. In fact, the only possible trade agreement on the horizon is with Chile, and that agreement, even if it were put into place tomorrow, would be unlikely to have any significant impact on the economic health of American agriculture. 
Moreover, granting the President fast-track authority is not currently warranted because of the total lack of consensus on American trade policy for the future. Large parts of the rest of the world cannot discern any consistent set of underlying principles governing U.S. trade policy decisions. Congress and the Administration have not come to an agreement on a trade policy framework, and in the absence of that framework, decisions are all too often made on an ad hoc basis. 
Granting the President fast-track authority requires the Congress to delegate much of the trade authority given the legislative branch by our Constitution to the President. It is no less a delegation of Congressional authority than the line-item veto. Fast track is therefore an issue of the utmost importance institutionally and Constitutionally to the Congress. In the absence of real consensus on trade policy within both the executive branch and the Congress, I cannot and do not support this kind of diminution of Congressional authority over trade. 
My support for the general objectives of the Grassley amendment does not represent any change in my view of the fast-track issue. In the absence of a consensus on a new trade policy architecture that includes not only the Congress and the President, but also American agriculture, labor, the business community, and the American people generally, I oppose providing the President with new fast-track negotiating authority.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is my privilege to take a few moments to join the Midwest Radio and Music Association (MRMA) in recognizing the career achievements of Ms. Jamie Foster Brown. The MRMA will host a tribute dinner in Ms. Brown's honor during their annual conference in Chicago on July 23, 1998. I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Jamie Foster Brown for this prestigious award. 
A native Chicagoan, Jamie Foster Brown graduated from Calumet High School and subsequently attended the University of Stockholm in Stockholm, Sweden. From these beginnings, Ms. Brown has become one of the most accomplished and respected women in the field of entertainment journalism. She publishes her own magazine, is heard on radio stations around the United States and England, and makes numerous television appearances each month. Jamie Foster Brown's success is testament to her talent and determination. 
Jamie Foster Brown began her career in the entertainment business in 1979 when she founded the Washington Theater Group. Ms. Brown subsequently went to work for Robert Johnson's Black Entertainment Television, and was among the pioneers at this network in creating television programming for African-American viewers written, directed, and produced by African-Americans. Ms. Brown's talents were recognized at BET, as she ascended the ranks from executive secretary to a producer of the network's top-rated programs, `Video LP' and `Video Soul.' 
In 1988, Jamie Foster Brown struck out on her own and founded Sister 2 Sister Magazine as a monthly trade newsletter targeted at prominent women in the entertainment and media industries. Ten years later, Sister 2 Sister has emerged as one of the most powerful and respected monthly entertainment magazines, with a special focus on African-American celebrity news. The magazine is often the first to be granted interviews with major American entertainers, and often breaks stories that are later picked up by other news organizations. 
In addition to publishing and writing for Sister 2 Sister Magazine, Ms. Brown has also recently written a book in honor of the late Betty Shabazz, entitled: Betty Shabazz: A Sisterfriend's Tribute In Words and Pictures. This loving tribute to Dr. Shabazz, published by Simon & Schuster, contains the recollections and anecdotes of friends and admirers including Maya Angelou, Myrlie Evers-Williams, and Ruby Dee. 
Building upon the success of her magazine, Jamie Foster Brown is a regular entertainment reporter on BET, and makes many appearances on nationally syndicated news and entertainment television shows. Additionally, Ms. Brown hosts `Sister 2 Sister Update,' a syndicated, daily celebrity news feature that is carried nationwide on the Westwood One Radio Network. `Sister 2 Sister Update' is also broadcast twice a week throughout Great Britain over the British Broadcasting Company's Greater London Radio. Ms. Brown is also heard daily as a frequent celebrity guest on radio stations in Chicago, Detroit, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. 
In a further display of her immense energy and enthusiasm for life, Ms. Brown also uses her considerable talents to better her community and our nation through volunteerism. Some of the many charitable organizations that have benefitted from Jamie Foster Brown's participation include the Duke Ellington School of Music, the Mount Sinai Parenting Institute and the Corporation Against Drug Abuse. For her professional and civic accomplishments, Ms. Brown has been honored by numerous organizations, including the Chicago League of Black Women, Anheuser Busch, Maurice Starr Productions, IMPACT and most recently, the Midwest Radio and Music Association. Along with balancing the demands of her career and charitable work, Ms. Brown remarkably finds time to remain a committed wife to Dr. Lorenzo Brown, as well as a loving and devoted mother to their two sons, Russell and Randall. 
In closing, I would like to extend my most sincere congratulations to Jamie Foster Brown, a remarkable woman who is most deserving of this award. It is an important symbol of her exceptional talent, dedication, and vision, and I am pleased that she is being distinguished with this honor by the Midwest Radio and Music Association. I wish her, and her family, God's speed and much continued success in the future.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, last month, more than 4,000 Illinoisans were sickened by an illness that was ultimately traced to potato salad contaminated by E. Coli bacteria. A few weeks ago, thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal were recalled after an outbreak of salmonella in the cereal infected more than 200 people, including residents of Illinois. In fact, according to the Center for Science and the Public Interest, the number of FDA-regulated food products that have been recalled due to contamination has increased fivefold over the past ten years. 
Health officials say that food poisoning causes more than 30 million illnesses and thousands of deaths annually. Consequently, the American people are increasingly concerned about the safety of our food supply. In 20th century America, this is unacceptable. No American should have to fear their food. 
That is why I support this amendment offered today by Senator Harkin to restore funding for the President's Food Safety Initiative. This amendment will provide $93 million to strengthen efforts by the United States Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration to address food safety issues. 
The amendment provides $33 million to recruit more scientists in the war against food dangers, and for developing new technologies for combating hazardous pathogens. $28 million is provided to check food imports at the border, increase seafood safety, and boost fruit and vegetable inspections. Twelve million is provided for consumer awareness campaigns so that children, cooks, and those who handle food at summer festivals can learn safer ways to prepare and handle food. 
This is not the first proposal to come before Congress that addresses food safety. Many of our colleagues have introduced legislation to respond to this growing problem. Senator Harkin has introduced S. 1264, which I have cosponsored, that would increase the ability of the USDA to recall tainted meat and poultry products. My distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, has introduced a bill to consolidate and coordinate federal food safety improvements that are currently scattered among a labyrinth of agencies. My colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, has proposed increasing FDA oversight on foreign produce. 
Regrettably, however, no significant action has occurred on these bills in this Congress. Meanwhile, the outbreaks of food illnesses are on the rise nationwide. Mr. President, we can do better. There is a time to debate, and a time to act, and today, Congress has a real opportunity to act. Let us pass this amendment and strengthen our federal food protection system so that the citizens of our country need not worry each time they reach for a scoop of picnic potato salad, a home-grilled hamburger, or a morning bowl of cereal. Doing nothing is not an option, and that is why I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am glad that the Senate is considering S. 318, the Homeowners Protection Act. I thank my colleagues on the Banking Committee for working so hard to come to a final agreement on this legislation. I am pleased with the result, and I believe that our final product is a good balance which will both benefit consumers and protect the industry. The Senate passed S. 318 last November and this version, which has been passed by the House, contains all of the key provisions of the bill as it first passed the Senate. 
Private Mortgage Insurance or PMI is a property insurance line that protects lenders from mortgage default risk. Homeowners pay the premiums, but the lender is the beneficary. PMI is generally used to facilitate loans in which the borrower makes a down payment of less than 20 percent, and the lender usually seeks coverage of the initial 20 percent of the loan value. 
However, a number of homeowners currently continue to pay premiums well pass the point of reaching 20 percent equity in their home, and sometimes for the entire life of the loan. This excessive PMI coverage is not only expensive for the consumer, but provides little added protection to the lender. In many cases, homeowners are never informed of their right to cancel PMI, or are faced with significant obstacles when they do attempt to cancel the coverage. This legislation will end that predatory practice. It gives homeowners the right to cancel PMI when they have accummulated sufficient equity in their home to protect the lender from default. It will also provide for automatic cancellation of the mortgage insurance when the mortgagor's payments meet the defined loan to value ratio of 78 percent or less. Finally, the bill generally prohibits lenders from requiring that consumers obtain PMI when they have a 20 percent or more down payment, with certain exceptions.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I want to commend Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Coats, and Dodd for their efforts in putting this bill together, and thank them for working with me to include several of my priorities in the bill. 
No issue is as important to our future as education. When I was growing up, it was possible to graduate from high school and get a job as a police officer, a firefighter, or a clerk, and earn enough to raise and support a family. Mechanics used to train for their work on the job. The nursing profession used to consist of women who apprenticed in hospitals. 
Times have changed. Now, if you want to be a airline mechanic, you need four years of college. Nursing is a degree program, and there are sub-specialities of nurses who are highly and scientifically educated. One recent advertisement for a maintenance technician stated the job required an understanding of `basic principles of electricity, mechanical systems, and fluid power.' By the year 2000, the Department of Labor estimates that more than half of all new jobs will require an education beyond high school. 
A higher education has never been as important as it is today. Unfortunately, while the value of a higher education is increasing, so is its cost. According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, tuition as a percentage of median household income has nearly doubled over the last 15 years--from 4.5 percent in 1981, to 8.9 percent in 1995. In 14 states, tuition is more than 10 percent of median household income. In 30 states, tuition is more than eight percent of household income. In all but one state, tuition is 1995 was more than it was 15 years ago. 
The GAO reports that tuition at public, four-year colleges and universities increased 234 percent in 15 years. By contrast, the cost of medical care has gone up 182 percent, new cars by 106 percent, new houses by 101 percent, median household income by 82 percent, and food by 66 percent. The Consumer Price Index has risen 74 percent. 
The exploding cost of college means that access to higher education is getting more and more out of reach for working- and middle-class Americans. The more tuition goes up, the more students will be priced out of their opportunity to pursue the American Dream. 
That is exactly the wrong direction for our country. As President Clinton said in his 1997 State of the Union, `education is a critical national security issue for our future.' He is absolutely right. In order to compete with cheap, third-world labor in a global economy, and to maintain the rising standard of living to which we have grown accustomed, America will need a workforce even better trained than it is now. 
Last year in Davos, Switzerland, world economic leaders met to discuss the effects of technological change on the global market. They noted that if education and training policies do not keep pace with technological innovation, the gap between the `knows' and the `know-nots' will grow, increasing the disparities in wealth and capacity, and the ability of industrialized nations to remain competitive will shrink. 
It that is the case, we should be working overtime to ensure that no student is barred from college because of a lack of financial resources. The legislation before us today goes a long way toward achieving that goal. It will standardize and make available information about college costs, so we will know exactly why costs are increasing at a rate so out of proportion with every other indicia of inflation. It will help us solve the mystery of the case of the Incredible Rising Tuition Bill. It will help American families and students make better decisions about where to go to college. 
The legislation tells schools that the time has come to come clean about why their prices are climbing so rapidly, and to answer the question of whether the massive tuition increases are really necessary. Schools who opt to not comply with the requirements of the bill will be fined $25,000. I want to thank Senator Dodd for this provision. I believe it is particularly important, because it puts the schools on notice that we are serious about these requirements. 
I also want to thank Senator Dodd and the other managers of the bill for including an amendment of mine directing the Secretary of Education to study the impact of student debt. Unfortunately, the trend in student aid over the last 20 years has been to move away from grants in favor of loans. Combined with the increasing cost of college, this trend has meant that more and more students are graduating with more and more debt. 
According to the GAO, the percentage of undergraduate students who took out loans shot up 41 percent between 1993 and 1996. The percentage of graduates of four-year colleges who borrowed more than $20,000 rose from 9 percent in 1993 to 19 percent in 1996. 
The General Accounting Office was not able to determine, however, the effect of this increasing debt burden on students and graduates. Under this legislation, the Secretary of Education will, within 18 months, determine how this increasing burden affects students' decisions about whether and where to go to school, how much to borrow, how long to stay in school, what kind of employment to seek, and whether burdensome debt payments impede graduates' ability to save for retirement or invest in a home. 
The legislation will provide for the first time a comprehensive picture of exactly what is happening to college costs, why it is happening, and what the effects are. 
Mr. President, I also want to thank the managers of the bill, as well as Senator Wellstone, for incorporating the provisions of the Fair Play Act into this higher education legislation. The Fair Play Act, which I introduced last year with Senators Snowe and Kennedy, builds upon the extraordinary success of Title IX and promotes the continued expansion of athletic opportunities for women. 
Colleges and universities are currently required to collect information about their men's and women's athletic programs, including participation rates, operating and recruitment budgets, the availability of scholarships, revenues generated from athletic programs, and coaches' salaries, and are required to make this information available upon request. 
The Fair Play Act directs colleges and universities to send this information, which they already compile annually, to the Department of Education, and directs the Department to issue an annual report and make the information available through a variety of mechanisms, including the Department's World Wide Web site. 
The Fair Play Act will provide prospective students and prospective student athletes with the kind of information they need to make informed decisions about where to go to school. I will give the Department of Education valuable information to aid its enforcement of Title IX in the area of athletics, and it will encourage schools to continue to expand their athletic programs to meet the interests of women nationwide. 
Over its 25 year history, Title IX has been directly responsible for expanding the athletic opportunities available to millions of women and girls. The Fair Play Act builds on this legacy of success, and provides the information needed to ensure that the expansion of athletic opportunities available to women continues into the 21st century. 
I am grateful for the support of my colleagues on the Labor Committee, and I look forward to continuing to work with them on this important issue. 
Mr. President, I also want to thank the managers of this bill for accepting an amendment of mine creating a Faculty Development Fellowship Program. The program will enable institutions of higher education to award graduate fellowships to talented students from groups under-represented in the American professoriate. 
In many respects, colleges and universities are our nation's paragons of diversity. They understand the importance of having a student body made up of men and women of different races, ethnicities, and backgrounds. When I talk with university presidents from Illinois and elsewhere, they invariably tout their school's diversity. 
The diversity appears to stop, however, after the undergraduate level. There is a disturbing dearth of diversity among graduate students and professors. In 1993, African-Americans received only 3 percent of all doctoral degrees conferred in the United States, and women received only 38 percent. According to the Department of Education, only 14 percent of full-time instructional faculty at colleges and universities are minorities, and only one-third are women. 
We can do better than that. The problem is not a lack of talent among minorities and women, but a lack of opportunity. My amendment authorizes $30 million per year to encourage talented students from under-represented groups to pursue studies and become professors. The program will help us tap the talents of all our children, and therefore make us a stronger society. A community that gives all its members a chance to contribute to the maximum extent of their abilities is a stronger community, because it benefits from a broader range of contributions. As we head into the 21st century and a truly global economy, we cannot afford not to tap the talents of all our children. 
Mr. President, that is really what this whole bill is about, making sure that every American has the chance to go as far as his or her talents will allow. This bill is about making sure that wealth and class are not obstacles to education. It is about giving more students more opportunities to receive a better education. I congratulate the leaders of the Labor Committee for their bipartisan efforts to put this bill together, and I look forward to its imminent passage.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the Chair. 
I am pleased that we are finally completing action on one of the most important pieces of legislation this body will act upon, and that is the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998. This bill represents that first step toward restoring the confidence the American people have to have in our voluntary system of tax compliance. 
Since its creation in 1862, the Internal Revenue Service has grown to become one of the largest Federal agencies, employing some 100,000 workers. In addition, it is an agency with massive responsibilities. In just 1997 alone, the IRS collected approximately $1.5 trillion and processed some 200 million tax returns. The revenues collected by the IRS are sufficient to fund the necessary activities of our Government. In concept, it is one of the most civilized tax systems in the world. 
But it is no secret that taxpayers have lost confidence in our tax system. The public has lost patience with abuses that for years have been all too common within the IRS. In the interest of fixing this system, Congress created the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS almost 2 years ago. This important commission, which was made up of some 17 members and professional staff, examined the IRS for a year and developed a comprehensive report on changes that were needed to overhaul it. The work of this commission required hundreds of hours of private sessions with both the public and private sector experts, academics, and citizen groups to review IRS operations and services. The commission met privately with over 500 individuals, including senior level and frontline IRS employees across the country. 
The work of this commission, which provided many of the recommendations included in this legislation, was invaluable in getting us to where we are today. I applaud my colleagues on the Finance Committee, and in particular Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, for the leadership they provided as members of the national commission. I also thank our chairman, Senator Roth, and ranking member Moynihan for taking the next step and holding extensive hearings on this most important topic. Certainly without the hard work of these gentlemen we would not be here today. 
The lack of confidence felt by the American people was made all too obvious during the many hearings that were held by the Finance Committee over the last 9 months. We heard from taxpayers, attorneys, accountants, and IRS employees who discussed their personal experiences with the complexities and frustrations of the IRS. I was outraged--I think we all were outraged--by the stories of armed raids on innocent taxpayers' property, unauthorized and unnecessary audits of working-class families, and excessive fees and penalties charged to taxpayers who were trying to pay their tax bills in a timely and responsible manner, and all sorts of other outrages. 
The tales that were told at these hearings were appalling, but they were nothing new to thousands of taxpayers who themselves have had to experience it or know someone who has. 
At one time in my legal career, back when I was an assistant U.S. attorney, I represented the Internal Revenue Service in its dealings with taxpayers. It was back then, 
frankly, I learned in dealing with the Internal Revenue Service the devil is in the details. I learned firsthand you have to focus on details when it comes to any issue when dealing with a bureaucracy as large as the IRS. And that is why I am so proud of playing a role in this legislative response. 
I believe the details of this legislation will make a difference, a real difference. This bill attacks a big problem in sensible ways, and it brings much-needed change to the operation of the internal revenue system. It does it in ways that are fair, reasonable, and equitable for all taxpayers. It increases the protections and rights of American citizens in regard to the Service and the system. 
I am pleased that one particular amendment I promoted was included in the bill. This provision will expand the ability of the taxpayer to recover their costs when involved in defending themselves before the IRS and the taxpayer wins. I think this provision is essential to ensuring that taxpayers are not forced to pay for IRS' mistakes. 
There are other changes that I especially like. As the only woman on the Senate Finance Committee, I was particularly pleased that this legislation includes some relief for innocent spouses. All too often women are stuck holding the bills of their ex-husbands, only then finding out that their ex-spouse had not legally filed a tax return. 
I was contacted by one of my constituents from Illinois who had been told by the IRS that she could lose her new home, be prosecuted for income tax evasion, and have her wages garnished if she refused to pay a tax bill that was owed by her ex-husband due to a fraudulent tax return he had filed during their tumultuous marriage, even though she had, in fact, signed it. 
When she explained to the IRS that she had never been employed during the course of the marriage and could put them in touch with her ex-husband regarding that, the agent told her, `What do we need him for? We've got you.' 
Well, this legislation will make certain that those kinds of abuses against innocent spouses will no longer occur. This bill ensures that cases such as this never happen again, hopefully, and that the IRS will be encouraged to pursue both spouses and do the work that is needed to find out who owes what. 
It provides greater protection for women by giving them notice of their rights and their obligations up front before signing on to a joint tax return. 
The other list of positive changes that this bill makes to the current operation of the IRS, as well as the list of additional taxpayer rights, is quite extensive. This bill will allow taxpayers to enjoy a greater ability to sue the Internal Revenue Service when the IRS blatantly and intentionally disregards the law. It has a provision that will give the Secretary of the Treasury authority to provide up to $3 million annually in matching grants to assist low-income taxpayer clinics. There is a provision that will eliminate the penalty for failure to pay taxes when a taxpayer is paying those taxes under an installment agreement, which has been a huge problem. People find themselves with more penalties than they had to pay in underlying taxes. 
For those taxpayers who undergo an audit, the bill includes procedures to ensure that due process is afforded to them. Also, with regard to seizures, before property is seized, there must be a process so that any lien, levy, or seizure will be approved by a supervisor. 
Taxpayers will also be given greater access to installment payment agreements with the IRS, greater access to information about the appeals and collections process, and greater access to statements regarding payments and balance owed in installment agreements. 
There is one other provision, Mr. President, that I am especially happy to see in the bill, and that is the provision that extends the confidentiality privilege to accountants in civil matters before the Internal Revenue Service. This provision, which some 78 percent of the American taxpayers support, will give all taxpayers equal confidentiality protections for their discussion, not just with their lawyers but also the federally authorized tax advisers. Low-income taxpayers who often cannot afford attorneys will, therefore, be provided the same privileges and benefits that other taxpayers have. 
All of these changes are needed to amend the current operation of the IRS. The bill provides us with the historic opportunity to overhaul the Internal Revenue Service and transform it into an efficient, modern, and responsive agency. The IRS interacts with more citizens than any other Government agency or private sector business in America, and it collects 95 percent of the revenue needed to fund our Government. The bill we have before us is a thorough bill and makes vital changes to every aspect of the Internal Revenue Service's structure. 
Mr. President, it is a sad reflection of the reality of our lack of confidence that, much like this cartoon, many Americans do not believe that this bill will cure what ails the system. I am sure the Presiding Officer can see it. The IRS is here as Dracula in the coffin with a stake through his heart, asking his gnome, `You took names?' `Of course'--while the Senate celebrates. A lot of people think while we take the action we will take here, it is not going to really cure what ails the IRS --that after the Congress has had its say, they fear the IRS will go back to the bad old ways that undermined its reputation in the first place. 
To that issue, I want to suggest to anyone listening that the answer lies, I think, in both cooperation and vigilance. We all need to work together to do our part to make sure that the accountability of the IRS remains assured. The Service has started to reform itself, and we have high hopes that the new Commissioner, Mr. Rossotti, will actually be able to implement the management changes directed toward putting the `service' back into the Internal Revenue Service, back into the IRS. 
IRS employees, some of whom bravely stepped forward during the hearings to lament the state of affairs in the agency, can and must help with the healing and reconciliation of the Service with the American people. The Congress today is beginning to do its part. Much more needs to be done, to be sure. But because Congress, after all, is not blameless in creating the confusion and the complications that provided cover for excess and abuse, we need to take up tax simplification with the same purpose as we have taken up tax administration. 
I am hopeful that the Finance Committee as a whole--or, if necessary, as a commission modeled on the Kerrey-Grassley commission--will take up tax simplification so the average citizen or small business will be able voluntarily to comply with our tax laws without incurring the huge transaction costs just to pay people to interpret the law for them. Tax simplification will also go a long way toward restoring confidence in our system of voluntary tax compliance. 
In the final analysis, however, it will be the American people who do the most to keep the IRS on the right track. Abraham Lincoln once said, `In this country, public opinion is all.' He is right. The people got fed up with the abuse, and the Congress was moved to action. In this Republic, in this democracy, the Government is, after all, all of us. And so the passage of this bill will really be a reflection of public opinion operating in classic fashion in this country. It is, therefore, a victory that every citizen can and should celebrate. But keeping this victory will require our eternal vigilance. 
Again, I commend the chairman of the committee for the brilliant hearings that gave rise to this legislation and for the purposefulness with which he has moved this bill to the floor. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his gracious remarks, as well as for yielding me this time. 
The Federal Government funds less than 7 percent of the cost of elementary and secondary education. Most of the funding for it comes from your local property taxes or from your State. Now, the fact is that we are debating what to do with our paltry 7-percent contribution, and whether or not we can spread it out as Senator Kennedy and others have discussed, or whether we should focus our resources on behalf of rebuilding schools, providing concrete assistance to help relieve property taxes. It is illogical to suggest that too few Federal dollars can be divided even further, and yet somehow produce greater results. The fable of the loaves and fishes is not a model for funding public education. 
What we need to have is a partnership in which the Federal, State, and local governments come together to relieve the property-tax burden, to engage State support so that all of us, working together, can provide every child in this country with an opportunity for a quality education. This should not be a fight; this should not be finger pointing, and this should not be dissipating what little we have. We should bring our resources together so we can provide quality education. This legislation doesn't do it. I am happy that the President is going to veto this bill. I hope we can fix this problem here in the U.S. Congress. 
So, Mr. President, I oppose this conference report. I hope all my colleagues will join me in opposition to this bad legislation, but I know that the future of this bill has already been determined. I have no doubt that this bill will pass the Senate on a near-party line vote, just as it passed the House last Thursday on a near-party line vote. I also have no doubt that President Clinton will follow through on his pledge to veto this bill as soon as it reaches his desk. I have a letter, in fact, from President Clinton, that begins, `If the conference report on H.R. 2646 is presented to me, I will veto it . . .' 
Once that happens, we will be right back where we started. Our schools will be in no better shape than they were at the beginning of this Congress. Our children will have no greater opportunities than they did at the beginning of this Congress. Our country will be in no better position to compete in the 21st century economy that it was at the beginning of this Congress. 
Perhaps the only thing we will accomplish is the further erosion of the confidence of the American people in our ability to address important issues. No issue is more important to our future--and no issue is more important to the American people, as they tell us in poll after poll after poll--than education. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves as a legislative body that this bill was the best effort we could muster. 
We also ought to be ashamed of the process that was used to write this bill. I was supposed to be a member of the House/Senate conference committee that developed this final bill. I can tell you, Mr. President, that being a member of this conference committee meant nothing. There was no opportunity to help shape this legislation. There was no attempt made to bridge the ideological gap that has stalled any serious federal efforts to help our schools. It seems the sponsors of the bill are more interested in the political gain they expect to reap when the bill is vetoed than they are in trying to put together a bipartisan initiative to improve our schools. 
I think the sponsors of this bill have made a mistake in underestimating the acuity of the American people in matters relating to their children's education. This bill is a truly bad idea, and I do not think most Americans will be fooled by the sponsors' rhetoric once they see the reality of the legislation. 
The bill allows families to put up to $2,000 a year into special education IRAs, and withdraw the funds to meet the costs of attending public, private, or religious elementary and secondary schools. Contributions into these accounts would not be tax deductible, but interest income on the accounts would be tax free. 
The bill represents bad savings policy. The purpose of IRAs--individual retirement accounts--is to encourage long-term savings. The benefits derived from IRAs are directly related to the length of time the funds remain in the accounts. By allowing withdrawals only a few years after contributions have started, this bill actually discourages long-term savings. 
This bill is a waste of taxpayers' dollars. The benefits are so small as to make them irrelevant as a means of improving education. The average benefit to a family with a child in a public school 
would be only $7 per year, and only $37 per year for a family with a child in private school. Even though the benefits to families are so small, the scheme still manages to cost taxpayers $1.5 billion over a 10 year period, funds that could be used for real educational improvements. 
The bill is bad education policy. Instead of addressing the real needs of our nation's schools, it drains support from public education in America. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, more than half the benefits realized under this bill would flow to the seven percent of families whose children already attend private schools. Ensuring that all children have access to a high-quality education should be a priority for every American. Education is more than just a tool to improve the quality of life for individual students. It is a public good as well, as we all benefit from a well-educated citizenry. If some public schools are not up to the challenge of educating our children, then it is our responsibility to fix them, not abandon them. 
Mr. President, we can do better than this bill. We must do better if we expect to retain our competitive edge in the 21st century economy. Earlier this year, the grades were posted on a set of international math and science tests. The results were profoundly disturbing. American students placed at or near the bottom on every one of the math and science tests offered--below counties like Cyprus, Slovenia, and Iceland. These results should serve as a clarion call to every policymaker at every level that we need to do more for our children's education. We need a new partnership to increase the educational opportunities available to all our children. 
When this bill was being considered on the Senate floor, I offered an amendment that would have created such a partnership. The amendment would have provided tax credits to investors in school bonds, helping states and communities rebuild and modernize their crumbling school infrastructure. The amendment would have helped them modernize classrooms so that no child misses out on the information age. It would have helped them ease overcrowding, so that no child is forced to learn the principles of geometry in a gymnasium. It would have helped them patch leaky roofs, fix broken plumbing, and strengthen the facilities that provide the foundation for our children's education. 
In his veto letter, President Clinton wrote, `The need for school construction and renovation has never been more compelling. . . . If we want our children to be prepared for the 21st century, they ought to have 21st century schools.' Commenting on the ISTEA reauthorization bill he just signed, the President continued, `I have just signed into law major legislation that will provide more than $200 billion over six years to help build and repair our nation's highways, bridges, and other transportation infrastructure. Similarly, we have an obligation to invest in the infrastructure needs of our public schools. H.R. 2646 ignores that obligation.' 
Once this bill has been vetoed, I intend to again bring up my proposal to help states and communities rebuild and modernize our schools for the 21st century. Maybe by then the message that the American people have been sending to us--that they want us to work together, put our partisan differences aside, and pass real school improvement legislation--will have gotten through.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today to recognize a gentleman who is retiring from a distinguished career as President of the Chicago-based Metropolitan Family Services, Mr. A. Gerald Erickson. In his 27 years as President of this valuable agency, Jerry Erickson has demonstrated an outstanding level of commitment to under-served families and individuals in Chicago. Under his leadership, Metropolitan Family Services has a record of great accomplishments in improving the opportunities and quality of life for thousands of low-income Chicagoans. 
In 1958, Jerry Erickson began his career with the agency, then known as United Charities, as a social worker fresh out of school and a two year stint in the Army. After earning a Master's Degree in Social Work from the University of Chicago in 1960, Jerry remained with United Charities full time, and in 1971 became President. 
Two and a half years ago, and a quarter of a century into Mr. Erickson's tenure, United Charities changed its name to Metropolitan Family Services. Through this and many other organizational changes over the years, Jerry Erickson has remained steadfastly committed to serving the under-privileged residents of the Chicago metropolitan area. 
As Chicago's oldest and largest non-sectarian social services organization, Metropolitan Family Services provides services ranging from family counseling to financial education for more than 100,000 families in the Chicago area. The agency operates on an annual budget of approximately $22 million, and has recently concluded a successful $15 million private fundraising campaign. The success of the organization can be attributed to the committed hard work of all of the agency's staff, and to great leadership from Jerry Erickson. Through their efforts, the agency's future will be bright and long-lasting. 
Through out his career, Jerry Erickson has carried himself in a soft-spoken, modest manner which has led many of his colleagues in the field of social work to refer to him as the `Jimmy Stewart of social services.' Now, in classic Jerry Erickson character, he is quietly retiring as the President of Metropolitan Family Services and is passing the reigns on to a successor he helped choose. 
Those who know and work with Jerry Erickson should be heartened by his promise to continue to work as a consultant to social service agencies. And Jerry's successor, Richard Jones, Ph.D., is highly qualified and committed to continuing and expanding the great work of Metropolitan Family Services. 
Through his work with Metropolitan Family Services, as well as his participation and leadership in various national social services task forces, associations, and alliances, Jerry Erickson has well earned his reputation as a national leader in social work. Jerry Erickson's work is a model of service for all Americans to follow, and I commend his lasting commitment to serving the most vulnerable in our society. 
On behalf of all the lives he has touched in his outstanding career with Metropolitan Family Services, I want to thank him and wish him good luck and Godspeed in all of his new endeavors.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am honored today to offer a resolution that celebrates the 50 year anniversary of the integration of the U.S. Armed Forces. This resolution commemorates that historic day, July 28, 1948, when this country took a bold new step toward ensuring that our Armed Services reflected the tenets of democracy that this country stands for. 
Dr. Martin Luther King once said that the Declaration of Independence was a Declaration of Intent. By that he meant that the commitments of that eternal document, when written, did not at the time apply to all Americans, but only to some of them. Women are excluded altogether, native Americans and poor had less rights than landowners, and blacks were counted as three-fifths of a person. And yet, the vision and the truth of the principles set forth in the Declaration and Constitution of this great country have been the bedrock foundation of the patriotism of all Americans over time, no matter their condition at the time of its crafting, and no matter how difficult the struggle for equality and realization of that intent. 
`We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.' 
The rights so eloquently articulated in the Declaration defined in the Constitution could only be established, and later defended, by a strong military. Our armed forces, indeed all Americans, owe a debt of gratitude to President Truman, who fifty years ago strengthened our military and our society by issuing Executive Order No. 9981 thereby integrating the U.S. Armed Forces. 
Americans of African descent were eager to defend the ideal and the promise of this noble experiment in self-government from the very beginning. During the Revolutionary War, more than 5,000 free blacks fought to establish these United States of America. Rhode Island had a black battalion, and African-American men and women served in units from the various states as laborers, spies, nurses, cavalry, and infantrymen. During the Civil War, Harriet Tubman served as a union spy, a volunteer nurse, and a freedom fighter. So often was she in the field, that some soldiers affectionately dubbed her `General Tubman.' 
In no military conflict were Americans of African descent unwilling to offer their very lives to the service of their country, no matter the condition of their citizenship. My own grandfather served in the Army in World War 1, and I have vague recollections of stories of the experiences he had in France during that world-shaping cataclysm. He left, and returned to an America of Jim Crow apartheid, but was proud to have done his part to preserve freedom. His service, and that of others was founded on their sincere love of America, and their belief in its ideals. He believed in the Declaration of Intent, and was prepared to give his life in behalf of its promise. 
Continuing that tradition, my father served in World War II. Up until World War II, enlistment of Americans of African descent had been limited, but one year after Pearl Harbor, there were approximately 400,000 African Americans in the Army. By the end of the war, there were more than 150,000 in the Navy. In 1948, Harry Truman moved the Declaration of Intent closer to reality when he integrated the armed forces. He made it possible for Americans of color to participate as Americans in defense of the ideal liberty. By Executive Order 9981, he was able to breath life into the promise of equality, and in so doing gave added honor to the valor and commitment of all Americans. 
In all branches of the military service, the decision to end the divisions based on color and race allowed this country to tap the talents of 100% of her people, and in so doing, expand and strengthened the pool of talent in defense of the liberties of us all. 
The audacity of Truman's decision and his vision, were controversial at the time, but the wisdom of it paved the way not only or a winning military, but a nation's opportunity to live up to its promise. The valor of many of those who served was overlooked or downplayed at the time, as the nation undertook the slow adjustment to the change Truman encouraged. We are just now, after a Shaw University study and the reexamination of some of their contributions, acknowledging the role and heroism of some of those soldiers. Just last year, the President awarded medals of honor to seven black Americans for their valor in World War II. 
Truman recognized the value of diversity. It lay not only in the singular talent and contributions of some, but in the collective vigor of the whole. Our great nation has been forged by the sacrifice of Americans of every stripe, by the values which define us as one people. The military services have led the country in providing opportunities for excellence, and the defense of our country has benefitted from that leadership. Excellence and honor, valor and patriotism are values which bring us together as Americans, and shape our national character. Truman's decision made us a `More Perfect Nation' and continues to this day to be a shinning example of leadership. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this resolution, and in doing so celebrating the diversity of our nation's Armed Forces.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to share my thoughts concerning S. 1415, the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act. 
The fundamental goal of this bill was supposed to be to drastically reduce the number of children who become addicted to cigarettes. However, sometime during the last three weeks of debate on this bill the Senate seems to have lost its focus on that objective. 
We have debated three different amendments regarding lawyers fees--as if the states are incompetent to enter into legal contracts--and adopted one of them. We have spent the better part of a week on the marriage penalty and health insurance deductibility for the self-employed. Now, I happen to believe that those two issues are very important, and need to be addressed. But this bill is not the proper vehicle for addressing them. This bill is supposed to be about reducing smoking--particularly teen smoking. 
I still view this bill as the best means of focusing on the main goal. For all of its faults, the bill still gives the FDA the power to insure: that no human, animal, or cartoon image is used to advertise tobacco products; that tobacco companies do not advertise in color on the backs of magazines; that cigarettes are not advertised on bill boards or other outdoor signs; that tobacco products are not displayed in close proximity to products--like candy--that would be attractive to children; that cigarettes are not advertised on the Internet; and that payments are not made to celebrities to smoke in movies or on television. 
And this bill sets targets for reducing smoking by our young people and penalizes tobacco companies if they fail to meet those targets. This is only fair because tobacco companies have targeted our children. Aware that nearly 89 percent of all smokers begin smoking by age 18 and eager to maintain its market, the industry specifically targeted children in the hopes of creating life-long addicts. 
Its efforts have paid off handsomely. Today, more than 3 million American children and teenagers smoke cigarettes. Seventy-one percent of high school students have tried cigarette smoking and about one-third of high school students are current smokers. Teen smoking has risen for five years in a row. And if nothing is done, 5 million Americans who are now children will die prematurely from tobacco-related diseases. 
But tobacco products are responsible for enormous damage to all of our citizens, not just children. Smoking accounts for nearly one in five deaths in the United States. It is related to over 419,000 U.S. deaths each year--more than alcohol, car accidents, fires, suicides, drugs, and AIDS combined. Approximately half of all continuing smokers die prematurely from smoking. Of these, 50 percent die in middle age, losing, on average, 20 to 25 years of life. 
We now have proof that the tobacco companies knew precisely what the impact of their products would be. According to their own internal documents, these companies hid the truth regarding both the dangers associated with smoking and the addictiveness of their products. It is therefore time for the tobacco industry to be held accountable for marketing a product it knew to be unsafe. Fortunately, that is something that this bill accomplishes. 
I remain concerned about the regressive nature of the $1.10 per cigarette tax that this bill will levy and I believe that it addresses issues that, while important, have nothing to do with tobacco legislation and should be addressed separately. Despite the many problems that the Senate has faced during the last three weeks, I think it is a real mistake to kill the tobacco reform legislation at this time, and make no mistake about it, that is what is happening here today. 
Mr. President, we must tackle the issue of teenage smoking and this legislation may very well be our only opportunity to do so. I would not want to see this bill become law in its current form, but there are still ample opportunities to improve if we allow the legislative process to go forward. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues not to kill this bill today; I urge them to think of our children and the children that will follow them and to cast a vote to prevent another generation of young Americans from becoming addicted to tobacco.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I want to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of James Byrd Jr., who was brutally murdered last week in Jasper, Texas. I am deeply saddened that we in this day and age still have this type of crime being committed in our nation. 
I am even more outraged that this monstrous crime is being copied across the nation, from Louisiana to my own home state of Illinois. Just this past weekend, the Belleville News-Democrat reported that a 17-year-old from Belleville, Illinois, had to be rushed to the hospital after three youths grabbed him by his shirt and then dragged him until he fell under the wheels of their jeep. All the while they shouted racial epithets at him. 
This violence must be stopped. Unless we take swift action to end these atrocities, we run the risk of endangering all the progress we have made toward undoing the ugly legacy of racism. We must stop copycat acts of cowardice from undermining the basic freedoms that we all are entitled to enjoy. 
Every act of violence is reprehensible. Hate crimes are especially troubling, however, because they impact not only the victim, but the entire community. When a person is singled out and targeted for a hate crime, other members of that community feel isolated, vulnerable, and unprotected by the law. Hate crimes send a message to all members of a community that they are not free to walk the streets, to own property, or to enjoy their fundamental rights as Americans simply because of how they look or what they believe. 
But these crimes do not occur only on the back roads of our nation. In 1996, 6,768 crimes committed across the nation were motivated by racial bias; 1,497 by religious bias; 1,258 by sexual-orientation bias; and 1,179 by ethnic bias. 333 of these crimes occurred in my home state of Illinois. The City of Chicago reported 175 incidents, the lowest number since the City began keeping records. Unfortunately, the inhumane nature of last week's brutal murder only remind us that there still remains work to be done to fight the hate. 
Back in 1963, when a fire bomb at the 16th street Baptist Church took the lives of 4 children, the nation recoiled in horror at the cowardice and criminality of those who would resort to such violence. From that horror, however, grew a consensus that hate crimes are un-American, and must be exposed for what they are. The hood came off the hate. 
We have since redoubled our effort, and must redouble our resolve that never again will such crimes be ignored or overlooked or unpunished. We must continue to work together. This means educating one another, building coalitions with our neighbors, and standing together against racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry. 
The Administration is doing their part. In June of 1997, President Clinton announced One America in the 21st Century: The President's Initiative on Race. This Initiative has proven critical to initiating the dialogue on race in this country that is essential if we are ever to live as one. 
But we should do our part as well. I am a cosponsor of Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which was introduced by Senator Kennedy in November of last year. This bill would strengthen laws to protect Americans from hate crimes. We should act swiftly to pass this law, and to send a message to the American people that hate crimes will not be tolerated. 
Again, I want to commend the people of Jasper, Texas for coming together in this time of tragedy and saying no to hate in their community. Their actions of reconciliation are an example for all of us to follow in times of moral crisis.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, in January 1980, President Jimmy Carter terminated U.S. shipments of wheat and corn to the Soviet Union in retaliation against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The effect of this embargo on the USSR was limited, but the impact on American farmers was severe, cutting off the market for 17 million tons of U.S. grain and prompting the Soviets to reduce long term reliance on U.S. farm exports. 
This action unfairly singled out the agriculture community to shoulder the burden of U.S. foreign policy. Congress quickly responded by limiting the President's power to impose restrictions on agriculture exports. The Export Administration Act, the principal export control statute of the era, was amended to include provisions to prohibit the President from imposing export controls on farm commodities for more than sixty days without Congressional approval. 
The Export Administration Act expired August 20, 1994, however, and consequently, the legal protections that prevent the singling out of agriculture exports are no longer in place. 
The current statutory vehicle that allows the President to impose economic sanctions is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, also known by its acronym, IEEPA. The IEEPA allows the President to employ a wide range of sanctions against countries determined to be a threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, or economy. If the President chooses to act under IEEPA, he can then declare a national emergency, and then is required to report to Congress explaining his actions. Sanctions authorized under IEEPA can continue until the President decides to terminate the emergency, or unless Congress acts to terminate it by joint resolution. 
The President enjoys almost unlimited authority under IEEPA. The statute requires the President to consult with Congress on his actions, but this consultation is discretionary, not mandatory. Most importantly, nothing in IEEPA prevents a President from targeting American agriculture as a tool for sanctions or embargos against a foreign nation. 
My bill, the Selective Agriculture Embargo Prohibition Act, simply restores the protection against selective embargos that farmers enjoyed before the EAA was allowed to lapse. Under the provisions of my bill, a President who imposes an embargo on agriculture commodities, using the authority provided by IEEPA, must report this action immediately to Congress. The President also must set forth the reasons, in detail, for this action, and specify the period of time, which may not exceed one year, that the agriculture export controls are proposed to be in effect. 
My bill allows Congress 60 days after receiving the report to adopt a joint resolution approving the agriculture exports controls. If Congress fails to adopt that resolution within 60 days, then the controls shall cease to be effective upon the expiration of the 60 days. 
Entering and expanding into foreign markets is not a simple task. It requires years of extensive work to nurture business relationships, foster consumer confidence and trust, and establish the procedures for effective sales. Destroying foreign markets, by comparison, can occur swiftly and easily, wreaking long-lasting and largely irreparable damage on American industries that have invested the time and money to build a strong consumer base overseas. Those foreign purchasers who cannot rely on American imports will then turn to other sources--our foreign competitors--and shut out American products for good. 
That kind of damage was precisely the effect of the 1980 embargo on U.S. agriculture. And given the almost logarithmic increases in U.S. farm exports over the past decade, any sanction or embargo that targets agriculture today would have even greater devastating and permanent effects on the U.S. farm economy. We must ensure that this sort of mistake is never repeated. 
There will be critics who argue that my legislation ties the hands of the President. This is not the case. My bill simply ensures that we do not embargo agriculture commodities unless both the President and the Congress are in full agreement. My bill ensures that adequate safeguards are in place so that farm families do not unfairly shoulder the burden of American foreign policy. 
This legislation is very similar to the restrictions enacted three times by Congress during consideration of the Export Enhancement Act and later signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. This is a bipartisan bill is also good trade policy, good farm policy, and good economic policy. I urge my colleagues to support the swift passage of this bill in the Senate.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, two years ago the Congress joined together in a bipartisan manner to help schools and libraries across the nation give students and children access to modern technology. The Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996 created a new partnership between the federal government, state governments, school systems, and the private sector to help bring all our classrooms into the 21st century. The bill expanded the universal service program--which has historically given people living in rural areas the chance to purchase affordable phone service--and created a new `e-rate' for schools and libraries. Creating that partnership was the most important act the 104th Congress took for elementary and secondary schools, and we have yet to match that achievement in this Congress. It was one of the most important steps we have taken toward ensuring that all our children will have the opportunity to learn the kinds of skills they will need to compete in the 21st century economy. 
Our children need that kind of bipartisan support. When I was growing up, it was possible to graduate from high school and get a job as a police officer, a firefighter, or a clerk, and earn enough to raise and support a family. Mechanics used to train for their work on the job. The nursing profession used to consist of women who apprenticed in hospitals. 
Times have changed. Now, if you want to be an airline mechanic, you need four years of college. Nursing is a degree program, and there are sub-specialties of nurses who are highly and scientifically educated. An ad for a `maintenance technician' states the job requires an understanding of `basic principles of electricity, mechanical systems, and fluid power.' 
Many of our schools, however, are not giving our children the kind of education they will need to compete in this kind of economy. An estimated 60 percent of all new jobs created in the year 2000 will require skills held by only 22 percent of new workers. According to the Wall Street Journal, `Thousands of people are being turned down for factory work by companies that are actively recruiting,' because they lack the requisite math, communications, and computer skills. 
Given these facts, one would think that on the eve of the implementation of the e-rate we created two years ago, policy makers would be rallying around the new discounts for schools and libraries and celebrating the program's inauguration. Instead, duplicity and political opportunism have combined to cast doubt on the future of the e-rate. 
The duplicity began when certain telephone companies decided to add a new line item to customers' phone bills--a `national access charge,' or a `universal connectivity fee.' When customers call their phone companies asking about this new charge, it is my understanding they are often told it was the FCC who mandated that this new charge appear on their phone bills, or that it was the Congress who levied this new tax on them. 
Mr. President, that is disingenuous at best. The FCC did order long distance phone companies to pay into the universal service fund, in part to pay for the new discounts for schools and libraries. The FCC also, however, ordered a reduction in the access charges long distance companies must pay for using local phone networks--fees that can account for 40 or 50 percent of the cost of every long distance call. The reductions in access charges were greater than the new universal service charges. One would think, therefore, that long distance bills would drop as a result. Have they? Have the phone companies passed the savings from the access charge reductions on to their customers? 
No. The companies have not passed on all the savings from the access charge reductions, and have instead raised customers' bills in order to generate revenue for the universal service fund. They then blame the FCC or Congress, and customers are understandably confused, concerned, and upset. 
The chorus of customer complaints now appears to be rattling the bipartisan coalition that came together two years ago to create the e-rate. Republican leaders have derided the new charge on phone bills as an `illegal FCC tax,' or a `Gore tax,' trying to pin the phone bill increases on the Vice President. 
I am disappointed. We have gone from partnership to partisanship. We have gone from cooperation to confrontation. We have gone from thinking about our children and our future to trying to score political points. 
We can do better than that. Thirty thousand applications have poured in to the FCC this year from schools and libraries seeking to tap into the new e-rate. Those applications represent millions of American children counting on our help to gain the skills they need to remain competitive in the next century. What are we going to tell them if the e-rate crumbles under the weight of partisan politics? How are we going to explain to them why they do not know how to use a computer? 
I hope we will not have to do that. I hope we can all come together, with the same bipartisanship and cooperation we shared two years ago, to fix this program, resolve legitimate concerns, and ensure that the e-rate becomes available to schools and libraries across the country. 
Members of both parties have criticized the FCC for the way it has implemented the program, and I do not doubt that mistakes have been made. I only hope we can put aside the partisan sniping and figure out a constructive solution to the problem we face. We ought to be proud of what we accomplished two years ago when we created the e-rate. Let us not now trade that accomplishment for short-term political gain.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I oppose the Gramm amendment. It is an attempt to distract the Senate's attention from what should be the focus of our attention. It is a thinly veiled ploy to kill this bill, the only vehicle this body has had to address the epidemic of teen smoking and the disastrous effects on the health and well-being of generations of Americans who were lured into smoking by tobacco companies. 
This amendment has no place as a part of this bill, and because of the way it is financed, it has no place in any bill. I strongly agree we ought to face the marriage penalty issue as soon as possible, and I also would like to accelerate full deduction of health insurance expenses for the self-employed. I do not think, however, that we can address these issues by adding to one of the greatest problems facing our country's future economy--the solvency of the Social Security system. 
Just two months ago, this body agreed that the budget surplus should be reserved for reforming our Social Security System. It was a wise decision, for no one can honestly deny that the Social Security Trust Fund faces long-term problems. Based on information from the 1998 Social Security Trustees' report, it appears that, by the year 2013, Social Security benefit payments will begin to exceed the payments into the Social Security Trust Fund from employers and employees. By the year 2032, the Trust Fund will have used up its accumulated surpluses and will be unable to fully meet its obligations to American retirees. In order to guarantee the viability of the Trust Fund for our children and grandchildren, we must focus on its long-term future and begin the process of making necessary changes. 
Workers, the very workers that Senator Gramm seeks to help under his amendment, pay into the Trust Fund all their lives and expect--rightfully so, I might add--Social Security to be there for them when they retire. 
Because Congress has not yet acted to preserve the long-term viability of Social Security, I cannot support any proposal that would exacerbate the financial difficulties facing the Social Security Trust Fund. This amendment, however, will do exactly that. I cannot, in good conscience, vote for this amendment. 
I want to be clear that I am extremely troubled that some married couples are being taxed at a higher rate than they would be if they were single filers. I find it appalling that 20.9 million couples, some 42% of all American couples paid penalties totaling $28.8 billion just last year alone. Senator Gramm's right--we ought to fix this problem. But it is wrong to do it at the expense of further damaging a retirement security component that is so vital to the American people. 
Fortunately, we have another option. The Democratic alternative would address the marriage penalty problem without further endangering Social Security. This alternative targets more tax relief directly to the couples who are actually penalized by the tax code. The Gramm amendment, on the other hand, would not only provide less relief to the 42% of couples who currently pay a penalty, but would also provide a windfall to the 51% of married couples who currently receive a bonus (on average of $1,380 per couple) under our tax code. In addition, the Democratic alternative addresses the need to accelerate the health insurance deduction for the self employed in an manner that is sensible and sound. 
Overall, the Democratic alternative is a more thorough, more targeted, and more sound proposal, and in any event, it is better tax policy. 
I do not believe that it is wise to try to solve one problem by creating another, and I believe that the Democratic alternative avoids that pitfall, whereas the Gramm amendment does not. I urge all my colleagues to vote against the Gramm amendment, and for the Democratic alternative. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is my privilege to say a few words in honor of a native Illinoisan, Colonel Mary Tripp, who retired from the United States Air Force on June 1, 1998 after 23 years of proud service to our nation. 
Colonel Tripp's final assignment in the Air Force was director of the program honoring the 50th anniversary of the service. The project was a blend of motivational and historic information, which under Colonel Tripp's direction both informed the general public and energized her fellow airmen. From the national recognition at the Tournament of Roses Parade to the Pentagon Cake Cutting Ceremony with President Clinton, the hard work and dedication of Colonel Tripp shined in every event. The distinguished history of the United States Air Force is a story every American should know. Under Colonel Tripp's direction, this story was told. Through the example Colonel Tripp set as an officer duirng her career, the Air Force's proud legacy will continue to grow. 
As Colonel Tripp returns to private life in West Chicago, Illinois, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending her outstanding service to our nation, and wish her good luck and Godspeed in all of her future endeavors.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a brief moment to express my condolences to the families of the students killed and wounded during the tragic shooting yesterday at the Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon. 
The thoughts and prayers of all Americans today are with the families of Springfield. It is yet another community where lives have been shattered forever by children with easy access to firearms. 
This attack was the fourth killing in a high school in the last six months by a youth under the age of 16. Mr. President, this killing must stop. 
Last year, approximately 50% of all serious violent crimes were committed by teens against teens. Our nation's overall firearm-related death rate among children was nearly 12 times higher than among children in the other 25 industrialized countries combined. 
This is an outrage. Mr. President, these horrific crimes amply demonstrate that we have a responsibility to oppose the proliferation of violence and to stand fast against any effort to make firearms more freely available. Does anyone still believe that it is possible to raise children in a society where guns are so easily obtained? We cannot continue to protect our children in such a world. 
We must come together as a society and recommit ourselves to keeping firearms out of the hands of children and to guaranteeing that only those people who know how to use guns responsibly have access to them. We must expand programs to train gunowners in the proper use and storage of their weapons. 
Responsible gunowners have nothing to fear from reasonable gun laws. We must have reasonable gun laws that will prevent tragedies like the one that happened yesterday in that small community in Oregon from ever happening again. The second amendment was never intended as a subterfuge for domestic carnage. Our living constitution can respond to changes in our society which jeopardize our freedom from fear and random violence by children. I think it is appropriate for us to have that debate, given the importance to our children, to their safety, to our liberty and freedom and safety in our communities.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is my distinct honor to recognize an organization from my home state of Illinois that has been an invaluable resource for and promoter of women-owned small businesses. I am speaking of the Women's Business Development Center, who will hold their 12th annual Entrepreneurial Woman's Conference on September 9, 1998 in Chicago. 
Since 1986, the WBDC, a nationally-recognized nonprofit women's business assistance center, has assisted more than 30,000 women business owners in establishing and expanding small businesses throughout our country. The Women's Business and Finance Program, the Women's Business Enterprise Initiative, the Entrepreneurial Woman's Conference and the Women's Business and Buyers Mart are a few of the many programs and services of the WBDC that support female small business ownership and help to strengthen the entire U.S. economy. 
As the first permanent female member of the Senate Finance Committee, I know firsthand of the obstacles faced by women when attempting to establish a foothold in the world of commerce. The WBDC and its two founders, Hedy Ratner and Carol Dougal, have made great progress towards tearing down these obstacles. 
Today, women-owned small businesses are an integral part of the current success of the American economy. Currently, there are over 7.7 million women-owned businesses in the United States, generating $2.3 trillion in sales. In Illinois, there are over 250,000 women-owned businesses. These businesses mean more jobs for American workers. In fact, women business owners employ one of every four U.S. company workers. Certainly, some of this success is due in part to the programs and services offered by the WBDC in Illinois and similar programs in Indiana, Ohio, Florida, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Despite this success, there is still more to be done. I am confident that with help from organizations such as the WBDC, the number of women entrepreneurs will continue to rise. 
The Woman's Entrepreneurial Conference is the centerpiece of the WBDC's activities. The Conference provides women business owners with the opportunity to network, attend informative panel discussions, and pursue business opportunities in an environment that is supportive of the needs of female small business owners. It is my pleasure to welcome the conferees to Chicago, and to congratulate the WBDC for their work and dedication to increasing female ownership in the American marketplace.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Pat Mulloy for the position of Assistant Secretary for Market Access and Compliance at the Department of Commerce. He will be a real asset to the Department of Commerce. 
Pat Mulloy has been a key member of the Banking Committee staff for about thirteen years, and he has played a major role in all of the international economic and trade legislation acted on by the Committee over that period. I and my staff have worked closely with Mr. Mulloy on issues such as the Export Enhancement Act of 1993, which, among other things, reauthorized Eximbank's charter. He has the respect of all of the Members of the Banking Committee, both Democratic and Republican. 
Pat Mulloy not only has extensive legislative expertise with international economic and trade issues, he also has considerable economic and international experience in the executive branch of the federal government. Before coming to the Banking Committee, Mr. Mulloy was an attorney with the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, and a foreign service officer at the State Department. 
Mr. Mulloy has the background and the kind of good judgement that is so needed. The Commerce Department will benefit from his real commitment to principle, and dedication to public service. 
In closing, Mr. President I would like to relate a story Mr. Mulloy told the Finance Committee during his nomination hearing. Mr. Mulloy stated that when he went off to grade school each morning, his mother would put the sign of the cross on his head and say `Goodbye, good luck, and God Bless You, and grow up to be President.' While his new position will not take him to the White House, I am sure his mother would join us in saying goodbye, good luck, and God Bless You. We wish you well. I encourage all of my colleagues to support Pat Mulloy's nomination.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to share some general thoughts with regard to S. 1415, the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act. 
It has been said on the floor before that the fundamental goal of the legislation is to significantly reduce smoking among the Nation's youth. That, of course, is a goal that I think everyone can support. I certainly support it. 
I am going to take a slightly different tack, Mr. President, because I am a reformed cigarette smoker. I say to the Senator from Kentucky, I recently stopped smoking--successfully. And this time, for real. I developed the habit when I was a teenager, at a time when the tobacco companies were still marketing their products as being `safe.' In fact, I am old enough to remember television commercials portraying a `doctor' with the white coat on, with a stethoscope around his neck, talking about how one cigarette brand was `healthier' for you than another brand. Well, of course, we all know now that they were lying to us, frankly. The tobacco industry knew at the time that cigarettes are not healthy, they are not safe, and that they are all addictive. Cigarettes lead directly to a variety of cancers, emphysema, heart disease, premature death and, I point out to the ladies, wrinkles on your face. That is something tobacco companies have known for a long time; they just did not tell us, and they were not very candid about it. 
I very much wish that the measures we are discussing today had been in place when I was a teenager, because those measures might well have prevented me from starting to smoke in the first place. Since they were not, I started smoking many years ago and I have struggled since to quit smoking. I am now winning the battle. I haven't smoked in months. But I can tell you firsthand just how difficult it is to quit and stay off of cigarettes. It is a fact that cigarettes are addictive. 
We all know, again, that the tobacco industry knew full well that once young people started smoking, it would be very difficult for them to ever break the habit. Eighty-nine percent of all smokers begin smoking by the time they are age 18. People tend to start young. And eager to maintain its market, based on its own research--because they had a lot of money to put into research, population studies, and the like--the industry came along and specifically targeted children and young people in the hopes of creating lifelong addicts. 
Its efforts have paid off handsomely. Today, more than 4 million American children and teenagers, including over 180,000 Illinois children and teens, smoke cigarettes. Seventy percent of Illinois high school students have tried cigarette smoking and about 35 per cent are current smokers. Teen smoking has risen for five years in a row. And if nothing is done, 5 million Americans who are now children, including over 260,000 Illinois children, will die prematurely from tobacco-related diseases. Illinois children and teenagers currently illegally purchase over 12.9 million packs of cigarettes each year, resulting in almost $25 million in cigarette sales. 
This is a lot of money. That is one of the reasons this bill is so contentious, because there is an awful lot of money involved in this debate. 
But tobacco products are responsible for enormous damage to all of our citizens, not just children. Twenty-three percent of Illinois adults are smokers. Smoking accounts for nearly one in five deaths in the United States. It is related to over 419,000 U.S. deaths each year and over 19,000 deaths in Illinois--more than alcohol, car accidents, fires, suicides, drugs, and AIDS combined. Approximately half of all continuing smokers die prematurely from smoking. Of these, 50 percent die in middle age, losing, on average, 20 to 25 years of life. 
That is probably one of the reasons my teenage son, who is not a smoker, badgered me about smoking. I mean he was just relentless. He would take cigarettes and put them in the toilet so they would get wet. He would hide them. He would send me pictures of diseased lungs. He even started sending me pictures from National Geographic of spectrographic outlines of nicotine, the chemical component of nicotine. When it is put on the spectrograph, it looks like cigarette smoke. He thought this was hilarious. He was continuing to put pressure on me, and he succeeded. In addition to the fact that he would come up with all of the evidence, probably the most profound thing that he did was to say to me, `Mom, I want you to live, because I love you.' Of course, no dollar amount can you put on that kind of motivation. In part, I tried to stop. I have at this point stopped because of those motivations. 
But, in addition to the terrible human costs, the American affair with tobacco--as some have said on this floor, our country was built with tobacco from our earliest years--has exacted an immense economic toll. 
Tobacco-related illnesses cost the United States more than $144 billion a year in health care costs and lost productivity. Even though smokers die younger than the average American, over the course of their lives, current and former smokers generate an estimated $501 billion in excess health care costs. 
So the smokers account for a large part of the tremendous cost of health care in this country as well. 
On average, each cigarette pack sold costs Americans more than $3.90 in smoking-related expenses. Whatever the cost is of the cigarette that you buy, the taxpayers of this great country all have to chip in to try to take care of people like me who got addicted by these cigarette when they were teenagers. 
We now have proof that the tobacco 
companies knew precisely what the impact of their products would be. According to their own internal documents, these companies hid the truth regarding both the dangers associated with smoking and the addictiveness of their products. 
They even went so far as to testify falsely to the Congress when questioned on these issues for years, failing to disclose and hiding at all levels of industrial espionage associated with keeping the truth from the American people. But it is out now. Everybody knows the facts pertaining to the impact of smoking and the addictive nicotine and cigarettes. It is not even a debate anymore. These are true facts. They are indisputable facts. So the question becomes, What is it that we policymakers are going to do about it? 
It is time for the tobacco industry not only to be held accountable for marketing a product it knew to be unsafe but to assist in the effort to drastically cut the number of children who become addicted to cigarettes. While the bill now before us is far from perfect, on balance, I believe it offers us the only real chance we have to accomplish that goal. 
The original Commerce-reported bill, in my view, offered too much liability protection for tobacco companies, and too little penalties for failing to meet the legislation's targets for reducing smoking among our children and teenagers. I am pleased, therefore, that the yearly cap on surcharges for the tobacco industry for not meeting underage user reduction targets has been raised to $4 billion. I also strongly support the new uncapped, company-specific surcharge of $1,000 per underage user in excess of the yearly reduction target. 
I particularly want to commend the negotiators for removing the grant of total immunity to the parent companies and affiliates of cigarette manufacturers. Parent companies are where some of the most significant--and reprehensive--decisions have been made, and they are where the profits from the sales of cigarettes ultimately go. Those companies must be held accountable and under this new version of S. 1415, they are. 
I also think the bill's treatment of the liability cap issued has improved. I remain very uncomfortable, frankly, with the provision currently in the legislation which may get amended, that caps the amount that the industry must pay out in any given year for past, present, and future damages resulting from the use of its products at $8 billion annually. I recognize that this cap was raised over the weekend from $6.5 billion, but I do not believe that the tobacco industry is entitled to any cap at all. That is why I will vote in favor of an amendment that will remove the that cap. 
because I just think that people who have been harmed ought to be able to sue and to be compensated. It is just that kind of basic. I don't think putting a cap on liability and a shield like this is good policy in this situation. 
I am very much in favor of the decision to establish a Public Health Account within the unified trust fund. I believe that it is critical to target the money that the government will receive from this settlement, and strongly support the negotiators' decision to allocate 22 percent of the government's annual receipts to smoking education, prevention, and cessation programs as well as to counter-advertising initiatives. 
Nothing can beat education. I think the fact that we have true facts and we have educated so many people is one of the reasons there has been a change in the climate of opinion around the propriety and the acceptability, not to mention the dangers, of smoking. 
I am also concerned, however, about the fact that this new $1.10 fee that consumers will have to pay every time they buy a pack of cigarettes will fall mostly on moderate- and low-income Americans. That argument has been raised here on the floor, and it is true. Almost half of the tax increase--whether you call it a fee or a tax it is still money on top of the price of cigarettes. Almost half of that increased burden will fall on Americans who smoke and who make less than $30,000 annually, and 70 percent of it will fall on American smokers who make less than $50,000 annually. That means that smokers making $10,000 or less --which is really poverty in this country--annually will see their Federal tax burden rise by an astonishing 44 percent. 
The sad truth is that smoking behavior, the actual cigarette smoking, is disproportionately concentrated among moderate- and low-income Americans, and they are the ones being asked, frankly, to make the greatest financial sacrifice on behalf of our children and the public health. This fact gives me real pause. Frankly, I didn't think I would ever want to support--as a matter of fact, I tend to take a position against regressive taxes of this kind. Everything that I know about hard-working Americans who are of marginal incomes tells me that this tax will be tough for them to swallow. But at the same time, the truth is that smoking is voluntary behavior. So it is a tax you can choose not to pay--a fee you can choose not to pay--and it is precisely that decision that we are trying to inspire. 
It is also true that we do not have hard evidence that the reductions that are called for in the bill, the reductions in smoking behavior by our children, will be guaranteed. We do not have guarantees about that. We do not know for certain that price increases, advertising limitations, and the other provisions of this bill will ensure without any doubt that children and teenagers will not smoke. Smoking rates among the young dropped during the 1980s, and they have climbed up again during the 1990s. Frankly, there is no real explanation for these trends except that it is a matter of popular behavior and kids doing as they see their friends and their pals doing and role models in their own lives. I am hopeful that this new fee will help make smoking less glamorous, less appealing, and will encourage young people not to waste that money on something that is ultimately hurtful to them as well as the community as a whole. 
I have used the word `hope.' It is used a lot in this debate. Those of us who support the legislation are hoping that this bill will mitigate and reduce teen smoking. We are hoping that it will improve the public health. We are hoping it will help reduce the amount spent on health care. And these hopes, I think, are well founded and well represented in this legislation. 
This bill represents a huge gamble that we should and must take. Given what we know about the risks and consequences of smoking, we cannot just sit by and do nothing; we have to act. We have to do everything we possibly can to discourage our young people from taking up this habit. We have a duty to our children, to all of our Nation's children, to do everything we can to help them stay away from the addictive effects of nicotine. 
Mr. President, a strong coalition of health, public interest, and governmental organizations agrees and shares those hopes. A coalition of at least 48 major organizations including the American Cancer Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the National Association of County and City Health Officials, all of these organizations support comprehensive, effective tobacco control legislation. 
Moreover, while it is impossible to be certain that maybe price increases will achieve the kind of reductions in smoking by children this bill sets out, the best experts in this area in terms of the relationship between price and behavior, including economists from the University of Chicago in my hometown and others in the administration, tell us that a quick, dramatic increase in the price of cigarettes will likely result in major reductions in teen smoking. So I am hopeful that despite my real concerns about the inadequacies of this bill in the liability area, my real concerns about the regressive nature of the tax involved, and my real concern that this bill does not ask the tobacco companies to endure the same kind of sacrifice that it imposes on their adult customers, I do intend to support the legislation. 
It seems to me there is no other choice. As someone said to me--and I don't know whether it has been mentioned in the debate--if it is a tossup between death and taxes, I will take taxes. This is a situation where the choice is pretty clear, that we have an obligation to the public health and we have an obligation to our children to at least try to do what we can to 
erect barriers to the kind of destructive behavior cigarette smoking represents. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to take a few minutes to honor the career of a champion of public education, Dr. H. James Mahan, as he retires from the position of Superintendent of Homewood School District Number 153 in Homewood, Illinois. 
For 15 years, Dr. Mahan has led Homewood School District #153 down a path of educational excellence and innovation. In 1984, the district had 1,450 students and 90 professional staff members. Today, there are 2,240 students and 180 professional staffers. During this period of expansion, Dr. Mahan worked to ensure that the quality of education in his school district improved as well. 
Under his stewardship, district schools have twice been named Blue Ribbon Winners by the United States Department of Education. This success is in large part due to the sound educational principles that have been the basis of Dr. Mahan's leadership. He has developed meaningful physical improvement plans, initiated the use of the Internet and other technology as classroom tools, and he has encouraged local businesses and organizations to provide his district's students with hands-on learning experiences through internships and mentoring programs. Furthermore, Dr. Mahan has instilled in his schools the principles of fiscal prudence, good discipline and teacher development. 
Dr. Mahan's commitment to public education and to the students of Homewood School District #153 are commendable and serve as a model for others to follow. I congratulate Dr. Mahan on this milestone of his career, and wish him good luck and Godspeed in all of his future endeavors.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, this year, the Chicago Board of Trade is celebrating its 150th anniversary. Its an anniversary well worth celebrating, and not just in Chicago, but all across our country, because the vibrant, creative marketplace the Chicago Board of Trade created has meant a lot to all of us. 
Whether we are in the food production and distribution system, or not; whether we participate in our nation's financial markets or not, we have all benefitted from the agricultural and financial marketplace the Chicago Board of Trade first established 150 years ago. Food prices in the United States are lower than they otherwise would be because of the Board of Trade. Interest rates on federal securities--and, therefore, all interest rates that are related to rates on Treasury securities--are lower than they otherwise would be because of the Chicago Board of Trade. The existence of this extremely efficient, vital marketplace has saved us all money, whether we have ever purchased a futures contract or not. 
It is not by accident that this market is located in Chicago. Due to its central location, access to waterways and proximity to farmland, Chicago is the natural crossroads of commerce in the United States. Before the Board was created, however, problems of supply and demand, transportation, and storage created chaos in the agricultural marketplace. The solution was simple but ingenious. Eighty-two Chicago merchants came together to establish a price discovery mechanism to insure against volatile grains prices. The exchange began modestly--even giving a free lunch to guarantee the attendance of traders--but the concept caught on rapidly and spawned the global multi-billion dollar futures industry we know today. 
Belying its age, the Chicago Board of Trade remains energetic and eternally innovative. In the past ten years, the Board has introduced over 100 new products. Four years ago, the Board launched Project A, their global overnight electronic trading system, that has enjoyed tremendous success and will soon be expanded. This year, the Board of Trade will launch the Chicago Board Brokerage, a new electronic trading system for the trading of cash US Treasury securities. 
The success of the Board of Trade has not only created huge benefits for our nation generally, it has also contributed enormously to the economy of Chicago. Chicago's two future exchanges have created over 150,000 jobs, and put over $10 billion each night in the city's banks. 
Moreover, the Board has also made major aesthetic contributions to Chicago. In a city world-renowned for its architecture, the beautiful Board of Trade structure stands out as a major example of late Art Deco style--and one of Chicago's treasured landmarks. 
The Chicago Board of Trade is a shining example of what a little ingenuity and Midwest common sense can accomplish. The resolution my good friend from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and I are today introducing, congratulates the Board for 150 years of real accomplishment, and salutes the Board for demonstrating the kind of leadership that will ensure that their markets are as dynamic and useful to everyone involved in agricultural and our financial system--and to our economy generally--over the next 150 years. The Chicago Board of Trade richly deserves to be celebrated, and I urge all of my Colleagues to work with Senator Durbin and I to ensure that this resolution receives prompt and favorable consideration by the Senate.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am a member of the Senate Finance Committee, so it gives me special joy that we have at last turned the Senate's full attention to revamping the Internal Revenue Service. 
Should we have acted earlier? Of course, we should have. The House overwhelmingly passed its version of this bill months ago by a vote of 426 to 4, and so the reason that we have delayed, frankly, is inexplicable given this bill enjoys such broad-based support in both Chambers of the Congress. 
The Finance Committee unanimously reported this bill out for action in March, and so I am no less encouraged, however, that we are only this week acting on the bill. As you know, we had a subsequent set of hearings which spoke to and gave voice to additional problems with the Internal Revenue Service, and that had something to do with the delay. I think the American people would have liked to have seen us pass the legislation before the tax filing date in April. Nonetheless, we are here today in May to pass this bill, and I am hopeful that we will do so. 
Also, I am very pleased by the way that we have in the interim, since the beginning of these hearings and investigations, put in place a Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service who has demonstrated his willingness to act. I am thankful, also, that in the additional hearings that we had in the Finance Committee, any additional information that came out will provide that Commissioner with the information he will need to take immediate action to, one, uncover abuses, two, rectify them, and three, to protect those good employees in the IRS who have been trying to help with the reform of that agency. 
Over the last 8 months, I, along with a number of my colleagues on the Finance Committee, have heard horror story after horror story about the abuses inflicted on taxpayers by unsupportable activity within the IRS. We were all outraged by the stories of armed raids on innocent taxpayers' property, unauthorized and unnecessary audits of working-class families, and excessive fees and penalties charged to taxpayers who are just trying to pay their tax bills on time and in a responsible manner. The tales told at those hearings were appalling, but, frankly, they were nothing new to the American taxpayers who know too well what can happen when an agency with the powers of the Internal Revenue Service goes out of control. 
Unfortunately, these stories were not the first that we had heard about these abuses. In fact, if anything, the Congress was called upon to act precisely because of the taxpayers and citizens who were raising the point with all of us as elected officials and demanding action from us. So, finally, we now have an opportunity to respond to them. The calls that we had in my State of Illinois were from Illinoisans who had been verbally abused or harassed by auditors, people who had grown frustrated with not being able to get a simple answer to a simple question, or a nice answer to a simple question. 
All of those things, I think, reach critical mass. And finally the Congress is going to act on this matter. I think it is not a moment too soon. We all have a responsibility and a duty to correct the abuses and an obligation to put the `service' back into the Internal Revenue Service. 
I would like to point out that it has been some 40 years in the making since Congress has considered significant reforms to the IRS. With this bill we therefore have a historic opportunity to overhaul this agency and to transform it into an efficient, modern, and responsive agency that is focused on doing its job and not abusing the American people. The IRS interacts with more citizens than any other Government agency, or, frankly, any other private sector business. It collects fully 95 percent of the revenue which is needed to fund the national Government. It is, therefore, unfortunate that it has become one of the most feared and most hated agencies in the country. 
But the blame, frankly, does not lie solely with the IRS. My mother used to have an expression: `When you point one finger, you have three fingers pointing back to yourself.' I think, frankly, that Congress bears a significant amount of the blame for not exercising its appropriate and responsible role in oversight of the agency, but also for creating the chaotic tax collection system that we now have. I think, indeed, Congress bears the greatest blame for creating a Tax Code that is burdensome and is so complicated that the transaction costs to ordinary citizens are very often overwhelming. People who should otherwise be able to file a simple tax return find themselves frightened into going and paying tax preparers simply because the Code is so complex that they are afraid they can't make their way around it. 
In addition to the awful state of affairs at the IRS, our tax system has also presented a series of tax loopholes for dishonest citizens. You have the worst of both possible worlds. You have on the one hand complications that honest citizens have a hard time finding their way around, and loopholes that dishonest citizens find too readily. 
Last week, it was announced that a `tax gap' existed, which is the amount of nonpaid taxes that people avoid by taking advantage of the loopholes or the complications in the Code. That tax gap amounts to some $195 billion a year. In other words, honest citizens pay $1,600 a year per year forever in the taxes they pay because of tax avoidance. While our hearings did not go far enough in talking about this issue of tax compliance, it certainly, I think, heads in the right direction if we can restore some sense of fairness, and if we can restore some sense of confidence with the American people in the operation of this agency. 
Mr. President, additionally I hope that after we have passed this bill we will also begin to address the issue of tax complication. Just last month, some 120 million Americans sent out some form of tax return to the IRS. Of these taxpayers more than 40 percent of them filed either the short tax form known as the 1040EZ or the 1040 long form. These two forms--one of which is only one page long--are designed to be simple and easy to complete. But each year, again, millions of Americans paid millions of dollars to tax preparers to fill out these forms because they are afraid of making a mistake and facing the wrath of an IRS, which, frankly, is not known to be very user friendly. I hope that we will address the issue of tax compliance or tax simplification as we address the issue of 
reform of the agency, because while these two things are related they are not the same thing, and I think it would be a huge mistake to think that with the passage of this legislation we would have cured the underlying problem with the complexity and with the confusion that the Tax Code itself causes. 
Unfortunately, we frankly have been moving in the wrong direction in regard to tax simplification or getting rid of the complexities. For example, in last year's Balanced Budget Act, which was, of course, hailed as providing significant tax relief to the American people, the Balanced Budget Act added over 1 million new words and 315 new pages to the Internal Revenue Code. The capital gains computation form alone grew from 19 lines to 54 lines. So anybody who filled out their tax forms in April knows how much more difficult we have made the Code by trying to tinker and trying to give tax relief here and tax relief there. 
The result is tax complexity that is, frankly, overwhelming. The average taxpayer will spend some 9 hours and 54 minutes preparing just the 1040 form for the tax year 1997. The total burden on all taxpayers for maintaining records, preparing and filing their tax returns, is estimated to be in excess of 1.6 million hours this year. That is kind of a funny number and incomprehensible. But when you consider how many people have to put in that kind of time, it really is a staggering use of energy and time by the American people that, frankly, could be put to better use if we had a more simple and fair Tax Code. 
I believe, frankly, the system we have now is outrageous. Having the additional headache of figuring out the complex forms dealing with rude and cranky workers at the IRS and possibly facing audit is really overwhelming. That is what has led to this day and brought us to the point of reforming and changing the system. 
Mr. President, I think we took the first step toward positive change last October when the President nominated and we confirmed Mr. Rossotti to oversee the IRS. Commissioner Rossotti has already begun the process towards changing the way business is done over there. During his short tenure he has already been quick to respond to problems that are identified. He has proved that he is not afraid to make the hard calls at the IRS. Since his appointment in late October, Commissioner Rossotti has made several major administrative changes that will help taxpayers break through some of the red tape at the IRS. 
In December, Commissioner Rossotti announced the establishment of interim procedures requiring higher level management approval of seizures of property for nonpayment of Federal taxes. The issue of seizures was really one of the high points of the abuses that we heard because they are so dramatic and so obvious. In January, Commissioner Rossotti announced broad-sweeping changes designed to modernize the Service. This `modernization' was tailored to emphasize customer service as well as production within the agency. Then, in February Commissioner Rossotti announced internal changes to address the innocent spouse problem, and just this past month he announced the appointment of William Webster to head the IRS' review of the Criminal Investigations Division. I think we should all applaud his willingness to implement some meaningful changes and his interest in moving forward quickly on an issue which, frankly, has been very long in the coming. 
The solution does not lie solely in mending the day-to-day administrative operations of the IRS, however. Indeed, this body shares a great responsibility in ensuring that we are responsive to the needs of taxpayers by passing laws that will put the `service' back in International Revenue Service. I believe that this bill is a major step in that direction. 
In addition to giving Commissioner Rossotti the additional statutory authority he needs to continue restructuring the management of the agency, this bill also contains several administrative changes. A new oversight board is established that will have the responsibility of reviewing and approving the operational functions of the IRS and reviewing the practices and procedures of the IRS. The IRS is given greater flexibility in hiring and firing IRS employees, and electronic filers are encouraged to continue filing electronically by removing barriers. 
This legislation, however, also provides taxpayers with a plethora of expanded rights and protections, including provisions that will allow taxpayers to enjoy expanded ability to sue the IRS when the IRS blatantly and intentionally disregards the law; a provision that will give the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to provide up to $3 million annually in matching grants to low-income taxpayer clinics; and a provision that will eliminate the penalty for failure to pay taxes when a taxpayer is paying those taxes under an installment agreement. The rules for computation of interest have been simplifies. For those taxpayers who are audited, the bill will include procedures to insure that due process is afforded prior to the seizure of any property and it will require that the IRS set up a process so that any lien, levy, or seizure will have to be approved by a supervisor. Taxpayers would also be given greater access to installment payment agreements with the IRS, greater access to information about the appeals and collections process, and greater access to statements regarding the payments and balance owed in installment agreements. 
In addition, several of provisions that I helped craft, and that I believe will give taxpayers further protection, have also been included in this partisan legislation. For example, taxpayers who successfully defend themselves in disputes with the IRS will receive increased reimbursements for legal fees and other expenses incurred. In our hearings we heard from several attorneys who believes that the IRS should pay more reasonable damages when the IRS erroneously pursues an innocent taxpayer. I believe it is only fair that we not leave the taxpayer holding the bill when the IRS audits them unfairly. 
Finally, this legislation will also give greater protection to other individuals who are often overlooked by the tax law. For example, new protections for innocent spouses are included in the bill. The change would make couples who file joint returns liable only for taxes based on the income of the husband or wife instead of the total liability for all of the couple's taxes. 
There are several other provisions that I believe will also serve useful to many taxpayers. Among them is a so called technical correction that will ensure that more farmers are eligible for the inheritance tax relief that was approved last year by Congress and a provision that would protect computer software writers from having their `source code' information arbitrarily accessed by the IRS. I support the amendment, it is unfortunate that the unintended consequences of complexities we've recently added to the Tax Code come to be remedied by such technical corrections. 
All of these changes are needed to amend the current operation of the IRS, but there is still much more to do to address the desperate condition of our tax system as a whole. This bill presents a vital first step in that process. 
In closing, I would like to by commending Senators Roth and Moynihan on their leadership in the Senate Finance Committee on this bill. I would also like to the Kerry Commission for finally getting us to this point. 
I would have preferred to have completed fundamental reform of the IRS prior to the April 15th deadline that 140,000,000 taxpayers have to meet, but as the saying goes, `better late than never.' I remain encouraged that fundamental reform of our tax system as a whole is around the corner, and I look forward to completing action on this bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, and in doing so beginning the process of reforming our tax system in a manner that is fair and efficient for all Americans. 
I commend the commission, the Kerrey commission. Senator Kerrey is on the floor. I want to commend him for his work in this regard. He has done a great deal to bring us this far. I want to commend the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for his work in giving us a bipartisan bill. I want to register my strong support for this initiative. I think this bill shows Congress at its best, when we are functioning in the oversight capacity over these agencies that I think the Founding Fathers intended us to do. This oversight is so vitally important to restore confidence not just in the Internal Revenue Service but in our Government as a whole. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today is the 50th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel. I would like to take a moment to reflect upon the significance of this historic event. 
For the nearly two millennia that preceded the founding of Israel, Jews across the globe had experienced unrelenting persecution, culminating in the previously unimaginable apocalypse of the Holocaust. In the wake of Adolph Hitler's effort to exterminate all of the Jews of Europe, and his success murdering six million of them, the moral imperative of establishing a Jewish state became clear. And so the Jewish people battled to create that which had only been dreamed of for 19 centuries: a nation of their own. 
Their triumph marked the beginning of one of the most inspiring stories of the 20th century. That Israel would survive to see today's anniversary was far from certain. It's founding brought about the first of four wars in which outnumbered Israeli forces somehow managed to defeat or hold off the armies of its hostile neighbors. Israel's courage and ingenuity in the face of overwhelming odds is, quite simply, unparalleled in the modern world. 
Despite the constant threat to its security, out of the desert, Israel has created a flourishing, democratic society, home to innovative science, cutting-edge technology, and rich culture. Today, its economy rivals that of Western Europe in terms of per capita wealth. 
I am proud of the role that the United States has played in helping to keep this brave nation alive. To this day, the preservation and maintenance of Israel's national security remains the foundation upon which U.S. policy in the Middle East rests. Israel remains one of America's most trusted allies--a nation with which we have cooperated to resolve a variety of regional and global issues. Time and again over the last 50 years, Israel and the United States have demonstrated that we share a special relationship that transcends parochial and short-term policy objectives. 
I have always believed that there can be no real peace in the Middle East unless Israel's security is guaranteed. That is why, throughout my career, I have supported strong U.S. economic and military support for Israel. As the greatest democratic nation on the planet, I believe that the United States must do everything in its power to ensure that Israel--the only multi-party democracy in the Middle East--survives. 
Currently, the best way for the United States to ensure the future security and prosperity not only of Israel but of the entire region is for it to play a strong role in keeping the Middle East Peace Process alive. If further strife and sorrow in the region is to be avoided, dialogue between Israel and her historic enemies must be maintained. Although the Peace Process has stalled recently, I believe that it can be revived if the United States remains committed to serving as an honest intermediary between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Key to the effort to see the participants through this difficult period is President Clinton's commitment to provide financial and technical assistance to Israel to help fight terrorism and to monitor the Palestinian Authority's compliance with the Oslo Accords. 
Mr. President, the Israeli people have demonstrated countless times that they are willing to take risks for peace. That is why I am confident that they will face the challenges of implementing the Oslo Accords and the Declaration of Principles with fortitude and creativity. The United States must stand shoulder to shoulder with them as they make this effort. Working together, I am confident that we can forge a peace that will guarantee that Israel will live to celebrate its centennial in 2048.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, a strong North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an important vehicle for maintaining security in Europe. For half a century NATO has been critical to maintaining security in Europe. Largely because of NATO, Europe has enjoyed more than 50 years without war among its major powers, the longest period in modern history. Because of this success, European countries that at one time were in a competing alliance, are now clamoring to join NATO. Today we have a historic opportunity to extend the NATO umbrella to additional European countries, and to expand the benefits that the alliance has created. 
Dr. Brzezinski of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made a compelling case for NATO expansion and its importance to the United States. He said: 
For me, the central stake in NATO expansion is the long-term historic and strategic relationship between America and Europe. NATO expansion is central to the vitality of the American-European connection, to the scope of democratic and secure Europe, and to the ability of America and Europe to work together in promoting international security. 
The expansion of the Euroatlantic alliance will bring into NATO counsels new, solidly democratic and very pro-American nations. That will further deepen the American-European kinship while expanding Europe's zone of peace and democracy. Such a more secure Europe will be a better and more vital partner for America in the continuing effort to make democracy more widespread and international cooperation more pervasive. That is why NATO's enlargement--in itself a vivid testimonial to the dynamism of the democratic ideal--is very much in America's long-term national interest. 
Since its inception, NATO has provided a forum to resolve disagreements among members and for institutionalizing norms and relations fundamental to modern democracies. It is natural therefore, that newly emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe, which qualify, should be considered for membership in the alliance. 
The accession to the alliance of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary is the culmination of years of work on these countries part to meet the requirements of NATO membership. As Dr. John Micgiel, Director of the East Central European Center at Columbia University has said, `the mere prospect of membership . . . has acted as a catalyst for political reform. . ..' Furthermore the `three prospective member countries have each taken a proactive role in cooperating with their neighbors and sometime former adversaries.' 
These three countries have demonstrated functioning democratic political systems, as well as economic reforms that will allow them to share the costs of NATO membership. Although there are no set requirements for membership, at a minimum, candidates for membership must meet the following five requirements: new members must uphold democracy, including tolerating diversity; new members must be making progress toward a market economy; their military forces must be under firm civilian control; they must be good neighbors and respect sovereignty outside their borders; and they must be working toward compatibility with NATO forces. 
Poland's membership is the logical culmination of its long struggle for freedom and economic independence. In 1989, the world watched as Poland became one of the first former Soviet-controlled countries to hold free and democratic elections. `Solidarity' became a symbol of freedom recognized around the globe. 
In 1993, Poland was the first country in the region to record economic growth, and it now has one of the strongest economies in Europe. In 1997, its GDP grew at a rate of about seven percent, while its inflation and unemployment rates declined. 
Moreover, Poland has demonstrated its readiness to contribute to security beyond its borders, one of the requirements of NATO membership. Poland contributed forces to the Gulf War coalition and currently provides troops to the NATO-led Stabilization Force mission striving to keep peace in Bosnia. 
Hungary has met the requirements for NATO membership by holding fully free and fair elections since 1989. Over the past nine years, the country has had two complete democratic changes of government. Economically, Hungary has engaged in successful, yet painful, stabilization programs to cut its current budget deficits. Since 1990, Hungary has attracted almost $16 billion in foreign direct investment; almost a third of all foreign direct investment in Central and Eastern Europe. 
Since 1989, the Czech Republic has held three fully free and fair elections. Their constitution contains protections similar to ours, such as the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and the freedom of the press. Economically, the country has privatized state-owned enterprises, engaged in tight monetary policies, and liberalized trade policies. As a result inflation is controlled, the GDP has been rising since 1994, and unemployment is low. 
Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were chosen to join the alliance because they meet all the requirements of admission. Each will be a good ally and each country is prepared to accept the responsibilities of NATO membership, including contributing their share to NATO's costs. I would like to congratulate Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, for their courage, for their perseverance and now for their imminent membership in the greatest military security alliance the world has ever known. 
Other countries will soon also be prepared to join the alliance, that is why I believe the expansion of NATO should be regarded as a process rather than the enactment of a single policy. Nations such as Romania and Slovenia, who were not invited to join NATO at the Madrid summit should be extended NATO membership once they meet the alliance's admission requirements. 
During the 104th Congress, I supported the NATO Enlargement and Facilitation Act of 1996. This legislation would have extended economic aid to those countries in Central and Eastern Europe showing genuine interest in furthering economic privatization and political pluralization as a prerequisite to NATO membership. This legislation sent an important signal of American support for these countries undergoing the painful transition from communism to democratic market reform. 
Mr. President, constituents from my state have indicated strong support for NATO expansion. While my constituents include Americans of Hungarian and Czech descent, you may know that Chicago has been called the Warsaw of the Midwest because of the large number of city residents of Polish descent. Statewide, there are nearly 1 million Illinoisans of Polish-ancestry, many of whom who have contacted my office in support of Poland's imminent entry into NATO. 
Mr. President, it is not, however, merely the many Polish-Americans, or Hungarian-Americans or Czech-Americans in Illinois and around the United States who wish these countries well as they assume the responsibilities of full NATO membership. Freedom-loving people in every part of the world can take heart from these countries' examples. History records the innumerable times that they have been invaded by hostile armies. But these people have strived to maintain their culture and their unique way of life, and that struggle has finally been rewarded. For as long as there is a North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, their security will be guaranteed by some of the most powerful nations on earth.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Internet Predator Prevention Act of 1998. This legislation will give much needed protection to the millions of American families with children. 
In the past two decades, the Internet has grown dramatically. In 1981, there were only 213 computers hooked into the Internet. In January of last year, it was estimated that 17,753,266 computers were wired into the Internet. And the number of web sites has also increased significantly in just the last several years: In June of 1993, there were only 130 reported web sites. By January 1996, that number had grown to more than 100,000. The Congressional Research Service reports that studies on the internet have found that 9 million to 47 million people are using the Internet each year. 
This enormous new `cyberworld,' which crosses state and national boundaries as well as race, gender and age barriers, has created a plethora of new communities, new business opportunities, and unfortunately, new crimes. It seems as if every month, we are hearing stories of children who have been exploited and hurt because of contacts they have made on the Internet. 
I am struck by two particular incidents that arose in my home state of Illinois in just the past year. In August of 1997, I was contacted by the mother of a 9-year-old Joilet girl whose name and number had been posted on a series of web pages, bulletin boards and chat rooms that was designed to attract child molesters. This family only learned of the posting when they began to receive illicit phone calls from strangers at odd times of the night. A second family from Illinois had a similar experience when a stranger began `logging on' using their 10-year-old daughter's name. The child's name and the family's home telephone number was posted on the Internet in a chat room for pedophiles. These parents were lucky enough to learn that their child's name had been posted on one of these sites before their children were placed in greater danger. 
Across this nation, there have been numerous other instances in which parents have learned that their children's names, addresses, and phone numbers have been posted on Web pages, bulletin boards, and chat rooms where pedophiles and child molesters lurk. 
This ought to be a crime. No one should be allowed to set a child up for a potentially dangerous situation that could have a lasting and irrevocable impact. The Internet should serve as a resource and learning took, and not a vehicle for exploitation. 
Currently, there are very few state laws that exist that address this issue. The few laws that do exist are vague and do not carry the weight needed to prosecute pedophiles for their crimes. The quick growth of the Internet has made it difficult to control Internet postings and, in this case, state and other traditional boundaries cannot and do not apply. Often times, a child and his or her exploiter may live in different states on different sides of the country. The crime taking place, however, is not any less significant than if they were in the same room. 
I believe that the Federal government can play an important role in stopping child exploitation on the Internet. The federal government has the ability to regulate interstate activity and federal law has jurisdiction over all 50 states and territories. A federal law will be able to navigate the complexity of the issues the Internet raises regarding interstate commerce and can be used to prosecute criminals regardless of what state the perpetrator lives in. 
Today, I am introducing legislation which I believe will address this growing problem. My legislation would make it a crime to post a child's name, address, or telephone number on an Internet web site, chat room or bulletin board in order to make that child available for criminal sexual acts with an adult. This bill uses the least restrictive means of regulating against one of the most offensive acts a human being can commit toward another: the exploitation of a child. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the quick passage of this legislation.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Thank you very much. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I will be brief. As both a minority --the only minority Member of this Chamber--and a woman, I fit both bills. Quite frankly, we have been down the road of separate but equal and unequal in this country. Unless it is equal, it winds up being unequal. The discrimination that is possible by this legislation for girls is too frightening to support it. I rise, therefore, in opposition. I ask there be hearings on this matter so that we can visit with the parents and see what direction they would like to take. Thank you.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, shortly I will offer an amendment on behalf of myself and 18 others to submit a plan to help rebuild and modernize our schools for the 21st century. The amendment creates a simple and effective partnership between the Federal Government, State and local governments, and the private sector to provide the financial backing communities need to upgrade and modernize our schools. 
This legislation will help modernize classrooms so that no child misses out on the information age. It will also help ease overcrowding--again, so that no child is subjected to what Jonathan Kozol in his landmark book called `Savage Inequalities' that are created by school environments that are unsuitable for learning. It will help local governments patch the roofs, fix broken plumbing, and strengthen the facilities that provide the foundation for our children's education. 
Just last month the grades were posted on a set of international math and science tests. Though results of those tests were profoundly disturbing--American students placed at or near the bottom of every one of the math and science tests offered, below countries like Cyprus, Norway, Iceland and Slovenia--these results should be a clarion call to every policymaker at every level that we need to do more to support public education in this country. 
Our amendment does exactly that. It creates a new category of zero interest bonds for States and school districts to issue to finance capital improvements. States and school districts will be able to issue some $21.8 billion worth of these bonds over the next 2 years. Purchasers of the bonds would receive Federal income tax credits instead of interest. By using this innovative mechanism, this plan cuts the costs of major school repair and construction by at least a third, and in many cases by up to 50 percent. Over a 5-year period of time, this plan will cost the Federal Government only $3.3 billion. We pay for the amendment with several tax proposals from the President's budget, several of which have already been approved by the Finance Committee. So this bill is paid for, it is in the President's budget, and it will allow the leveraging of substantial amounts of money to help rebuild our crumbling schools. 
The interesting thing about it, even at $21.8 billion, this amendment only scratches the surface. According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, it will cost $112 billion just to bring the schools in this country up to good overall condition. That is just the basics, just bringing them up to code. That does not equip them with computers and fancy cosmetics but just to address the toll of deferred maintenance. The GAO found that crumbling schools are to be found in every corner of America. According to the General Accounting Office, 38 percent of schools in urban areas are in the worst condition, 30 percent of rural schools are in the worst condition, and 29 percent of suburban schools are in the worst condition. So it is about a third, a third, a third. This is not just an inner-city phenomenon. Crumbling schools can be found in every kind of community in every part of our country. 
In my home State of Illinois, school construction and modernization needs top $13 billion. Many of our school districts have a difficult time even buying textbooks and pencils, let alone financing major capital improvements. 
I will share some pictures. I think everybody who is listening to this debate has probably seen some crumbling schools, but for those who have not been in a local school recently, I show a picture of a hallway in a school in my city. Nobody is proud to show pictures like this, but this is just reality. As you can see, it looks like they have a new fire alarm, but given the hallway, the infrastructure, they need a new wall. They probably should replace the whole building, but the point is the deferred maintenance is clearly evident. 
Here is another picture showing the same school. We see the peeling paint and the water damage. Here is the floor and the wall. It looks like someone tried to cover up parts of the hallway, but the efforts were obviously not good enough. 
Our children should not have to learn in these kinds of conditions. This is a picture of a school in a suburb of Chicago. Again, this is a suburban school. These are the kinds of classes kids are required to learn in during these times. A couple of weeks ago, President Clinton came to Chicago and toured the Rachel Carson Elementary School. That school has two buildings, an old one and a brand new one. In the old building, classrooms are unusable because of many years of water damage, and the windows have turned opaque. In the new building, students can learn in modern and bright facilities. According to the students and teachers, the new facility affords a much greater opportunity to learn. And the teachers were so pleased because it afforded them an opportunity to teach, again, without regard to the threat of falling plaster. 
Mr. President, our amendment will allow for school districts to build and modernize more than 5,000 new schools across the country. It will also give communities the power to relieve overcrowding. We have the largest number of children in our schools in the history of our country. 
According to the Department of Education, enrollment will continue to grow over the next 10 years. Just to maintain current class sizes, we will need to build 6,000 new schools over the next 10 years. Now, again, the problem of overcrowding, in addition to the problem of deferred maintenance and neglect, is a serious one. I have visited schools in my home State of Illinois where study halls are held in hallways because there is no other classroom space. I have seen stairway landings converted into computer labs, and cardboard partitions used to turn one classroom into two. There was one school where the lunch room had been converted into two classrooms so that the students would have to eat in the gymnasium instead of having gym class where they have `adaptive physical education,' where they stand next to their desks because the gymnasium is now a lunch room. I was tickled to listen to the young people talk about this problem and this issue. One young man talked about a phenomenon called `hall rage.' He said, `it happens when you are in the halls trying to get to class and it is so crowded that you can't go anywhere.' They are experiencing violence in the hallways because of overcrowding. 
These conditions directly affect the ability of children to learn and, again, the research has backed up the intuition, what people know intuitively, which is that we cannot expect our children to learn tomorrow's skills in buildings that are crumbling down around them. 
The problem is so widespread and pervasive, and I submit to anyone listening that this really is a direct and foreseeable result of our archaic school funding system. The current system of school funding was established over a century ago when the Nation's wealth was measured in terms of landholdings. Wealth is no longer accumulated just in land, and the funding mechanism of relying primarily on the local property tax is no longer appropriate, nor is it adequate. The current school finance budget works against most American children and mitigates most families' best efforts to improve local schools. 
Again, according to the General Accounting Office, in another study they did, poor and middle-class school districts really make the greatest tax effort, but the system works against them. In some 35 States, poor and middle-class districts have higher tax rates than the wealthiest districts, but they raise less revenue because there is, of course, less 
property wealth to tax. In 11 States, this unfair system has led the State courts to rule that their State school finance systems are unconstitutional. In nearly every case, States complied by raising property taxes or sales taxes to finance school improvement. By the way, litigation is pending in 16 other States. The odds are that many of those lawsuits will in fact result in higher local property taxes. 
Mr. President, our amendment can break this cycle of crumbling schools and higher local taxes. Our amendment breaks the mold of school financing and creates a new partnership for the 21st century where the Federal Government, by giving tax benefits for investment, allows States and local governments to leverage $22 billion worth of investment in school infrastructure. I urge my colleagues to take a close look at the needs of the schools in their States and decide what they stand for--higher property taxes and crumbling schools, or lower property taxes and a new partnership to improve our schools for the 21st century. Our students should learn about gravity in a science lab, not from falling ceiling tiles. Our schools should be wired for computers, not just metal detectors. Our classrooms should be comfortable, not just crowded like rush hour commuter trains. 
I believe that the American public understands this issue. According to a bipartisan poll released earlier this year, 76 percent of registered voters would support a $30 billion, 10-year Federal commitment to rebuilding and modernizing our schools.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would not be here as a Member of the U.S. Senate if it were not for a system of quality public education when I came through the system. It breaks my heart that we have failed to maintain that level of quality public education across this country for every child that wants to access it. 
It seems to me that as we go into the next century, it is the responsibility of our generation to give every child the opportunity to learn and to give every child at least the basic tools with which that individual would not only be able to provide for themselves, but really provide for our country's well-being. As we go into the next century, there is no question that in this international global competition, in this information age and age of technology, unless we educate every child and give every child the ability to access a quality education, to go as far as their talents will allow them, we will be undermining our Nation's ability to maintain its standard as a leader in this world economy. How and whether or not we train our work force may well come down to something as simple as providing an environment that is suitable for learning. 
Our kids cannot learn if they are put in environments that are not suitable for learning, in which they cannot access the new technology. I submit to my colleagues that this is a very, very serious matter. I find it interesting that even the columnists and the cartoonists have drawn cartoons about this. But this is certainly no laughing matter. If anything, this issue goes to the heart of our generation's commitment to provide the next generation of Americans with at least as much as we inherited from the last generation. We inherited from them a school system that was quality, that was adequate, in which people like me could get an education and ascend to the U.S. Senate. I am afraid that unless we tackle this problem and create a partnership to help modernize the schools, we will fail the next generation of Americans. I therefore call upon my colleagues to put partisanship aside and support this amendment. 
I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the Chair. 
I say to my chairman, Senator Roth, that in the first instance the Senator misread the bill. This plan provides for minimal administrative requirements on the State and local authorities charged with school repair and construction. The State and local school districts need meet only two main requirements for issuing these new school bonds. First, they have to document their school facility need. Second, they have to describe how they intend to allocate the bonding authority to assure that the schools get the benefit of it. 
End of story. There is no reapplying for money. There is no continuous oversight. There is no getting individual projects approved by the Federal agency. There is nothing about having to deal with big Government at all in this legislation. 
I would add also that no school district, no State is required to take this. This is for those school districts that want to issue these bonds. It is a matter of engaging the private sector, engaging communities, engaging local governments in helping to rebuild their schools. 
I yield 5 minutes--he wants 7.

It will not fix a single school. It will not deal with an existing problem. It will not reduce a single dollar of property taxes. 
I point out that the quote from the administration that was made in 1996 makes it very clear: Traditional responsibility, financed by local taxpayers. We are trying to provide a partnership to break the cycle of crumbling schools and high property taxes by providing a partnership that allows us to fix crumbling schools, to fix up the schools, provide an environment suitable for learning, and reduce the property tax burden, and bring the Federal Government, in cooperation and collaboration--not a lot of bureaucracy, but as a helping hand. 
The Federal Government is not the problem here. It is not the solution here. It can only help and assist local efforts. That is all this amendment does. I urge my colleagues to support the Moseley-Braun amendment.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I fear somehow that in parts of this debate we are talking at each other. That is unfortunate. 
Everybody, of course, supports increased savings. That is not the issue. The question is whether or not this is education policy and whether or not we are responding to a very real need. 
The relief provided in the Coverdell proposal, the $7 a year, is not going to fix a single broken window or roof. It is not going to address this issue of public schools at all. That is where this issue is joined, unfortunately.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. This chart is a `report card' for America's infrastructure, which was put together by the American Society of Civil Engineers--not exactly a probureaucracy group. We can see mass transit got a C; bridges, a C-minus; solid waste, a C-minus; waste water, a D-plus; roads, a D-minus; but schools got an F. We clearly have a problem. 
A minimum $112 billion only begins to set up a partnership. Again, it is not the grant program that the administration opposed several years ago but a bureaucracy-free tax credit. We give local governments the help we can best give them, which is access to the tax benefits that this legislation provides. And from that assistance, from that modest assistance that we as a national community give these local governments, we will be able to go to the private sector, go to the capital markets, and raise the money to begin to grapple with this problem. 
We have an `F' on schools in this country in terms of infrastructure needs. I daresay the real tragedy here is that we have not reached consensus yet that it is appropriate as a national community that we come together in a partnership, that we work together, instead of pointing fingers about what is wrong and pointing the blame and saying it is this group's fault or the local property taxpayer. We ought to work together to make certain issues like this get resolved in behalf of the children of our country and the future of this country.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to introduce the Empowerment Zone Enhancement Act of 1998. This legislation, I believe, will build on the economic success we have built over the last several years. 
We have worked to make this the strongest economy in a generation--by balancing the budget, investing in education and training, and opening up new markets for American products around the world. But we have also worked to make this the most inclusive economy in history, so everyone has a chance to participate, and no one is left behind. Further, we have stressed Community Empowerment. A strategy that gives people the tools--and acts as a catalyst for community collaboration--then communities can tap the ingenuity and enthusiasm of every citizen, and restore our downtowns and distressed areas to a level even our grandparents would be proud of. 
I believe that we are beginning to see results in this Community Empowerment Philosophy. The Empowerment Zone Initiative is the cornerstone program to ensure that all Americans benefit from the strong economy. The purpose of the EZ/EC Initiative is to assist distressed urban and rural communities to develop and implement holistic revitalization programs. In the first round of the Initiative, 105 urban and rural EZ's and EC's were designated. 
This Initiative has not only produced the intended benefits of creating economic opportunity, broad-based community partnerships and sustainable community development, but has also had far-reaching spin-off benefits in bringing together all segments of the EZ/ECs around the goal of community revitalization. 
Over $4 Billion in private investment has been leveraged in the EZ and EC's. Nearly 20,000 jobs have been created that have been filled by people who have previously not had access to economic opportunity. Entrepreneurship opportunities have been created for people with a dream and the economic opportunity to see that dream realized. Job training and education opportunities have been created for nearly 45,000 residents. More than 12,000 Housing units have been constructed or rehabilitated. Communities have addressed public safety, infrastructure and environmental clean-up needs through more than 350 programs. More than 52,000 children, youth and adults have been provided with services to help overcome challenges and contribute to their communities growth. In short, the EZ/EC Initiative has proven to be a successful holistic approach to community revitalization and economic development. 
The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 authorized designation of 20 additional Empowerment Zones (15 urban and 5 rural), and provided for tax incentives for these new zones. However, that Act did not provide the flexible grant funding critical to the core concept and mission of the EZ/EC Initiative. This bill provides for $1.7 billion in grant funds over a 10-year period, $1.5 billion for the urban zones and $0.2 billion for the rural zones. The application process for the second round of Empowerment Zones will begin in a few weeks. Communities will have several months to put together a comprehensive strategic plan that leverages private investment and provides for economic opportunity. 
We can rebuild even our poorest areas--if all the people in the community get together and decide to do it, and then find the tools they need to get it done. That's why we are so committed to our approach. We believe in government as a catalyst--helping to bring communities together to plan their future, and giving them the tools they need to reach that future. And it's working. For the first time in 30 years, we're seeing success. 
From the South Bronx to areas of the Mississippi Delta to South Central LA to North Kenwood in Chicago--there is a growing American renaissance that is turning abandoned buildings, empty lots, and crime-ridden street corners into new homes, new hope and new opportunity for the millions of Americans. This success makes us more and more convinced we're on the right track to reverse decades of decay, and to remake America's distressed areas into sources of pride and prosperity. 
The hardest part is getting started, and we've got it started now all across the country. Now it's just a matter of moving up the momentum by expanding the number of zones. With communities working from the inside, the federal government helping draw investment from the outside--I know this is a battle we're going to win.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of two outstanding judicial nominees from my state of Illinois, G. Patrick Murphy and Michael P. McCuskey. 
It is therefore appropriate that I also say a few words about a matter of critical importance: the exceptionally large number of judicial vacancies in our federal court system. 
Currently, there are 83 vacancies in the federal judiciary. This accounts for approximately one out of every ten federal judges. Thirty of the vacancies have been in existence for 18 months or longer and are therefore regarded as `judicial emergencies.' 
Illinois presently has seven vacant judgeships. One of these, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, dates back to November of 1992. Another, in the Central District, dates back to October of 1994. Two of the nominees for these vacancies are awaiting action by the Senate Judiciary Committee and two will be confirmed today by the full Senate. In the Southern District, the chief judge went for more than a year without having time to hear a single civil case because his criminal docket was so full. In the Central District, major civil trials have had to be postponed because of the shortage of judges. Commenting on the imminent retirement of a third judge in his district, Marvin Aspen, the chief judge of the Northern District, recently told the Chicago Sun-Times that `if Congress does not move quickly . . . in a short time we could have a serious backlog.' Last week, Judge Aspen called the number of judicial vacancies nationwide `an unprecedented scandal.' The chief judge of the Southern District, Phil Gilbert, says that they are currently managing to get the job done, but they `badly' need additional judges. Michael Mihm of the Central District says that they are also continuing to function, but they are definitely feeling the pinch. They have had to delay at least one major civil trial, and are increasingly dependent on visiting judges. Litigants are often forced to travel long distances to get their day in court. 
The situation in the Southern and Central Districts of Illinois is dire. There are four judgeships in the Southern District, and 2 of them are vacant, a vacancy rate of 50%, which is much higher than the nationwide rate of 10% vacancies. The Central District numbers are exactly the same. The Southern District vacancy is one of the oldest in the country. As of today, 1,972 days have passed without a judge in that seat. And the Central District seat has been vacant for 1,275 days. 
Today, two Illinois nominees for those districts will 
be confirmed by the full Senate. These nominees, Mike McCuskey and Pat Murphy, have been pending on the floor for 147 days. There is no question of their qualifications; both were unanimously recommended by the Judiciary Committee in November. 
Mike McCuskey was born in Peoria, and has served as a state court judge for the last nine years. Prior to attending law school, he taught high school history, and coached baseball. He worked his way through law school as a security guard. Judge McCuskey has a reputation as an outstanding jurist, fair, firm and thorough. He is also known for his community service, such as reading to grade school children and emceeing senior citizen activities at the County Fair. 
Pat Murphy was born in Marion, Illinois. He enlisted in the Marines at the age of 17, and spent his 18th birthday in Vietnam. Upon returning to Illinois, he attended college and law school with the help of the GI Bill. After both of his parents died, he helped raise his four younger siblings, although, as he puts it, they all raised each other. Mr. Murphy has extensive legal experience, with over 100 jury trials and 200 bench trials under his belt. The first year he was eligible, he was elected to the prestigious American College of Trial Attorneys. He has a sterling reputation among all who have worked with him or against him. He is also known for his generosity to veterans, giving pro bono representation to any veteran who asks for help. 
As both of these nominees have languished on the Senate calendar, the delay has taken its toll on their personal lives. Several weeks ago, Judge McCuskey was forced to choose between his home and his current state court job. Last year he signed a housing contract, which was finalized in March. Since he entered the contract, the rules of residency for a state court judge changed. This confirmation vote comes just in time for him. He can now move into his new house without worrying about losing his state court judgeship. If this confirmation vote did not come today, he would have been forced to default on his contract. Pat Murphy is a solo practitioner. He has been unable to predict his ability to continue to represent clients. Yet, he has had to make a living over the last one hundred and fifty days. 
Consideration of these nominees has been long overdue, and I am so pleased that they will finally be confirmed by the full Senate. Both of these men are highly qualified and will be a credit to the federal judiciary. Moreover, the vacancies they fill will help resolve a crisis in Illinois--a crisis that is evident throughout our nation. 
As Chief Justice Rehnquist stated in his 1997 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary, `Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without 
eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.' The Chief Justice placed much of the blame squarely on the Senate. He said, `Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed during 1994.' 
By failing to move expeditiously on judicial nominations, the majority party in the Senate is failing to live up to its responsibilities to the American people. President Clinton has made 134 judicial nominations during the 105th Congress, but the Senate has confirmed only 51 of these individuals. As the Chicago Tribune editorialized earlier this year, `If Republicans don't like the choices, let the Senate debate them and vote them down. Doing nothing, as the Senate has done lately, is cowardly and cynical.' 
Worse yet, it is affecting the quality of justice in the United States. The increase in the number of judicial vacancies in combination with the growth in criminal and civil filings has created a huge backlog of federal cases. According to Chief Justice Rehnquist, since 1990, the number of cases filed in courts of appeals has increased by 21 percent and those filed in district courts have grown by 24 percent. There was a five percent increase in the criminal caseload in 1997. This resulted in the largest federal criminal caseload in 60 years. 
According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the number of active cases pending for at least three years rose 20 percent from 1995 to 1996. In 1997, Federal courts handled a record number of cases. Bankruptcy filings jumped more than 50 %, civil and appellate cases increased for the fourth consecutive year, and criminal caseloads were more crowded than at any time in the last 60 years. According to the most recent data provided by the Department of Justice, there are more than 16,000 federal cases that are more than three years old. 
Time magazine wrote last year that `some Republicans have as much as declared war on [President] Clinton's choices, parsing every phrase they've written for evidence of what they call judicial activism.' This has discouraged qualified candidates from subjecting themselves to the confirmation process. For instance, last September, Justice Richard P. Goldenhersch of the Illinois Court of Appeals, withdrew his name from consideration for a federal judgeship, stating that, because of the `poisoned atmosphere of the confirmation process, my nomination would be pending for an indefinite period of time.' He stated that the protracted nature of the process was `particularly unfair to the people of the Southern District of Illinois, who deserve a fully staffed court ready to hear their cases.' 
In condemning President Clinton's judicial nominations, one of my Republican colleagues described the judicial branch last year as being full of `renegade judges, [who are] a robed, contemptuous intellectual elite.' And in explaining why the confirmation of a California appeals court judge had been delayed for two years, a senior member of the Republican majority stated, `If you want to blame somebody for the slowness of approving judges to the Ninth Circuit, blame the Clinton and Carter appointees who have been ignoring the law and are true examples of activist judging.' 
The President's record of judicial appointments belies any assertion that he has sought to stack the federal judiciary with the types of judges referred to by my colleagues. The New York Times commented last year that what `may be most notable about Clinton's judicial appointments may be reluctance to fill the court with liberal judges.' The Times noted that a statistical analysis by three scholars `confirms the notion that the ideology of Clinton's appointees falls somewhere between the conservatives selected by [Presidents] Bush and Reagan and the liberals chosen by President Carter.' The Times quoted an author of the study, Professor Donald Songer of the University of South Carolina, as stating that Clinton's appointments were `decidedly less liberal than other modern Democratic presidents.' Professor Songer stated that, from an ideological standpoint, President Clinton's judges were most similar to judges selected by President Ford. 
Republican members of the Senate thus cannot claim that they are safeguarding the judiciary from liberal jurists. Indeed, it is they who, in the words of Time magazine, are currently engaged in `what has become a more partisan and ideological examination of all judicial nominees.' As my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, stated last September, the `continuing attack on the judicial branch [by Republican Members of Congress], the slowdown in the processing of the scores of good women and men the President has nominated to fill vacancies on the Federal courts around the country, and widespread threats of impeachment [against federal judges] are all part of a partisan ideological effort to intimidate the judiciary.' 
Mr. President, Chief Justice Rehnquist has called the independence of the judiciary `the crown jewel of our system of government.' Our courts are revered around the globe precisely because of their ability to administer justice impartially and without regard to the prevailing political climate. Republicans in Congress are seeking to undermine judicial independence and freedom of action. A key element of their strategy has been to put a choke hold on the process of confirming nominees sent by President Clinton. This state of affairs must not be allowed to continue. As Chief Justice Rehnquist has stated, `The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or down.' Let the Senate heed the words of the Chief Justice and commit itself to enabling the federal judiciary to be, as the Supreme Court pediments proclaim, the guardian of our liberty and the guarantor of equal justice under the law.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am so pleased that the Senate has agreed to accept my amendment on tax complexity. Mr. President, two weeks from now is April 15, a day known as Tax Day. On that day, approximately 120 million Americans will file some type of tax return to the Internal Revenue Service. Of these taxpayers, more than 40 percent will file the short tax forms known as the 1040EZ, or the 1040 long form. 
These two forms--only one page long--are designed to be simple and easy to complete, but Americans will pay millions of dollars to tax preparers to fill out these forms in their stead in order to avoid making a mistake and facing the wrath of the Internal Revenue Service. 
The perception is that the tax code is too complicated, and frankly, these Americans have good reasons to be concerned. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, passed by Congress last year and hailed as providing significant tax relief to every American, added over 1 million words and 315 pages to the Internal Revenue Code. The capital gains computation form alone grew from 19 lines to 54. Consequently the average taxpayer will spend 9 hours and 54 minutes preparing Form 1040 for the 1997 tax year. The total burden on all taxpayers of maintaining records, and preparing and filing tax returns is estimated to be in excess of 1,600,000 hours this year. 
Tax relief is not just about financial relief, it is also about paperwork relief. This amendment states that it is the Sense of the Senate that this chamber give priority to tax proposals that simplify the tax code and reject proposals that add greater complexity to the code and increased compliance costs to the taxpayer. I think we have sent a sound message to the American people that we are committed to reducing complexity in this already onerous tax system.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I believe that the Senate has taken a step in the right direction today by accepting my amendment that ensures that the Senate will not reduce the value of Social Security. Mr. President, Social Security is perhaps the most successful and important government program ever enacted in the United States. It has allowed millions of Americans to retire with dignity and has played a key role in bringing poverty among the elderly to the lowest level since the government began keeping poverty statistics. 
But if you ask young adults--the twenty-something and thirty-something Americans--whether they believe Social Security will be there for them, they will tell you that they are more likely to see a UFO than receive Social Security benefits when they are old. 
That's regrettable, Mr. President, not just because these young Americans are financing the benefits that my generation will receive from Social Security, but also because they have every right to benefit from Social Security when they reach their twilight years. Social Security was created not just for the current generation, or for our generation, but for all the generations that will follow. 
The Senate, I think, has a responsibility to restore the faith of young Americans in their Social Security. In a recent poll, fewer than one-third of Americans age 55 and older expressed a lack of confidence in the ability of the Social Security system to meet its long-term commitments. For those under age 55, however, nearly two-thirds expressed that view. 
Frankly, young Americans have good reason to be worried. Americans are living longer and retiring earlier. As a result, retirees will collect Social Security benefits for a far longer time than was anticipated when the system was developed. That means that younger Americans may be paying into a system that will no longer provide benefits when it is time for them to retire. 
The impact of these trends will be greatly magnified when the Baby Boom generation retires. Once the Boomers have retired, there will only be about tow working Americans contributing to Social Security for every retiree receiving benefits, down from over five just a generation ago. 
Social Security is too important to the retirement security of too many people for us to retreat from that accomplishment. More than one-half of the elderly do not receive private pensions and more than one-third have no income from assets. For 60 percent of all senior citizens, Social Security benefits provide almost 80 percent of their retirement income. For 80 percent of all senior citizens, Social Security benefits provide over 50 percent of their retirement income. 
It is our responsibility to act to ensure that the Social Security system provides the same value to new generations of Americans as it did to past recipients. It is my hope that in having passed this amendment, we will have demonstrated to younger Americans that we are committed to safeguarding the integrity of the Social Security system no only for their generation, but for all the ones that will follow. 
I also want to say how pleased I am that the amendment I proposed that would express the Senate's sentiment that the Administration should include in its yearly budget a generational impact study will also be included in the budget resolution. I believe that this type of information will be useful in our decision making process and will lead us in a direction that is proactive, rather than reactive. 
Again, I thank my colleagues for their support.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today our economy is remarkably strong, and this year our budget will balance for the first time since 1969. In 1993, many of my colleagues and I passed a historic budget plan that set the stage for this strong economy. Today, I am proud to report that the Congressional Budget Office estimates a surplus of $8 billion this year. 
In these past 4 years, we've achieved the lowest tax burden for working families in 20 years. Unemployment was 7.5 percent in 1992. Last month it fell to 4.7 percent, its lowest in 24 years. And since President Clinton took office, more than 13 million new jobs have been created. We have strengthened the economy while at the same time reducing the size of government. 
For the past several days, we have been considering the Budget resolution for 1999. This resolution could have provided us the opportunity to take the next vital step in creating even a stronger economy and addressing some of our nation's most urgent needs. While this resolution has several provisions which I do believe will lead us in that direction, I also believe that it fails to seize the opportunity to address some of our nation's most immediate needs, and for that reason, I will not support this budget resolution. 
First, let me say that I am pleased that the drafters of this resolution have made provisions for the Senate increases and offsets for reauthorization of ISTEA, assuming an additional $2.7 billion over five years for mass transit programs, $25.9 billion above last year's agreed to levels. In addition, I am pleased to see that an additional $5 billion in discretionary budget authority has been provided for the Child Care Block Grant, and I am additionally pleased to see provisions for the extension of the R&E tax credit, IRS reform, technical corrections to 1997 tax bill, and child care tax relief. 
Over the course of this week, however, several good amendments have been offered that could have strengthened this budget resolution and made it an even clearer expression of our values. Unfortunately, most of those efforts failed here on the Senate floor. The majority--who did nothing to help erase the red ink our Administration inherited from them--continues to cling to failed economic policies. 
For instance, this budget resolution fails to do anything in the way of addressing the $112 billion that the GAO reports is needed to bring America's crumbling schools up to code, or to address the need to strengthen our public school system. There is no greater challenge or threat to our nation's future prospects in this technological age and global economy than quality education for every American child. Failure to respond to that challenge is not only irresponsible, but destructive. 
Equally distressing is that fact that this resolution does not do enough to address the current status of our Medicare and Social Security systems. This opportunity should have been used, I believe, to provide retirement security for our seniors. Social Security and Medicare have worked well together, bringing poverty among the elderly to its lowest level since we have been keeping statistics. Furthermore, these programs have helped to increase life expectancy among men and women. Millions of senior citizens deserve to have a decent retirement, and this budget fails to address their needs. 
Do we need to operate these programs the same way? Of course not--but we do need to secure the guarantees they provide for Americans. The time for reform of both of these vital programs is now, and we do ourselves a disservice by not seizing this opportunity. 
As with education, the issue is whether we are preparing our nation for the challenges of the next century. 
We can fix these institutions and remain fiscally responsible. We have proven, in passing last year's budget agreement, that it is possible to address the needs of our nation and promote economic growth and a fair tax system at the same time. 
It is unfortunate that politics prevented us from fashioning a budget resolution that could have served the needs of all the American people, and not just a few. I cannot in good conscience support this budget resolution, and I urge my colleagues to vote against it.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, our amendment is a sense of the Senate that the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution assumes that we will enact legislation creating a partnership between the State, local, and national governments to rebuild and modernize our schools and the classrooms for the 21st century. 
Winston Churchill once said, `We shape our buildings, thereafter they shape us.' Nowhere is that more true than with schools. 
The poor condition of America's schools has a direct effect on the ability of our students to learn the kinds of skills they will need to compete in the 21st century global economy. America cannot compete if our students cannot learn, and our students cannot learn if their schools are crumbling down around them. 
Our amendment would ensure that school districts around the Nation have the resources they need to address school improvement priorities so we can give our children an environment suitable for learning. 
I encourage support for this amendment. It is, after all, a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. It will give everyone an opportunity to express without the particularity of the actual legislation. I express the support of doing the right thing by our kids.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may require, until such time as someone else comes up to speak. 
This amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution assumes that we will enact legislation creating a partnership between State and local governments and the private sector to rebuild and modernize our schools and classrooms for the 21st century. The amendment calls for the enactment of legislation similar to S. 1705, the Public School Modernization Act of 1998, which I have introduced along with a number of my colleagues. Our bill would establish a simple and effective means of helping communities modernize and revitalize their schools. 
The bill creates a new category of zero coupon bonds for States and school districts to issue to finance capital improvements. States and school districts would be able to issue $21.8 billion worth of these bonds over the next 2 years. Purchasers of the new bonds would receive Federal income tax credits in lieu of interest, thereby cutting the cost of upgrading the schools by at least a third and in some cases up to 50 percent. The bill will cost the Federal Government only $3.3 billion over five years. 
This amendment to the budget resolution is the first step toward enacting that legislation. It sends a signal that we in the Senate are serious about improving education in America. 
I call your attention to this report card for America's infrastructure. You will notice that school buildings get a failing grade; mass transit got a grade of C--we have taken up the infrastructure needs for mass transit; bridges, a C-minus; solid waste, a C-minus; waste water treatment, D-plus; roads, D-minus--but schools get an F. We are literally sending our children to crumbling schools in which education becomes well-nigh impossible. 
Those children--14 million of them, in fact--every day attend schools that are so deteriorated that they do not even meet basic code; 14 million children in this country every day attend schools which are that dilapidated, Mr. President. From all indications, in failing to provide for the modernization, renovation and repair of school facilities, we are literally causing these children to get less educational opportunity than they should be entitled to, but we are also hampering our Nation's ability to be competitive in the 21st century. 
At no point in our history has education been more important to both individual achievement or national prosperity. As H. G. Wells wrote nearly 80 years ago: `Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.' 
Education in America correlates with opportunity for individuals, for families and for our entire Nation. Indeed, the rungs on the ladder of opportunity in America are crafted in the classroom. It is very clear that high school graduates earn more money over the course of a lifetime. As a matter of fact, every year they earn 46 percent more than people who do not graduate from high school. College graduates earn 155 percent more than those who do not complete high school. And, of course, over the course of a lifetime, the most educated Americans will earn five times as much as the least educated Americans. That is on an individual level. 
The truth is that education correlates with every indicia of economic and social well-being. Educational attainment can be tied directly to income, to health, to the likelihood of being on welfare, to the likelihood of being incarcerated, and even to the likelihood of voting and participating in our democracy. 
It is, however, more than a tool to lift people out of poverty or to have a better standard of living. It is also the engine that will drive America's economy into the 21st century. In a Wall Street Journal survey last year of leading economists, 43 percent of them said the single most important thing we could do to increase our long-term economic growth rate would be to invest more in education, research and development. Nothing else came even close in the survey. One economist said:  
One of the few things economists will agree upon is the fact that economic growth is very strongly dependent on our own abilities. 
Another study, looking at the changing nature of the American work force, said: 
The crucial factor accounting for long-term success in the work force is a basic education provided at the primary and secondary levels. 
Of course, a recent study by the Manufacturing Institute confirmed that claim. It concluded that increasing the education level of workers by just 1 year raises the productivity level by 8.5 percent in manufacturing. 
If we fail to invest in education, we will put our Nation's economic future at risk. Unfortunately, too many of our schools, again, are not in adequate physical condition to meet the educational needs of our children. Too many of our schools are literally crumbling down around the students. 
The General Accounting Office, which did a major study, a landmark study, on this issue found that 14 million children attend schools in need of major renovation or outright replacement. Some 7 million children every day attend schools with life-threatening safety code violations. And they concluded that it will cost $112 billion just to bring our schools up to code--$112 billion across the country just to bring our schools up to code. That does not equip them with computers. That is not bells and whistles. That is just to address the toll that decades of deferred maintenance has taken. So this F relates to the $112 billion demand on us as Americans just to get our schools up to code in this country. 
I say `the country' broadly, and the truth is that crumbling schools are to be found in every corner of America. Again, according to the GAO, some 38 percent of schools in urban areas are 
in this kind of dilapidated condition; 30 percent of rural schools are in the same condition; and 29 percent of suburban schools are in the worst condition. Again, this is not statistically all that different between 29 percent in the suburbs, 30 percent in rural areas and 38 percent in urban areas. 
Mr. President, the problem with crumbling schools has become so widespread that even Peppermint Patty in the Peanuts cartoon has a leaky school roof. Take a look here. In this series of Peanuts cartoon, Peppermint Patty and her friend Marcie express their frustration over the fact that they cannot get anyone to repair the leaky roof. `It's keeping me awake.' The roof is leaking. They still don't take it. 
Marcie forgot to mention the repair of the roof as she talked about the fact that the children were having difficulty learning. But the truth of the matter is that we cannot forget about the fact that our schools are dilapidated. 
In my State of Illinois, school modernization and construction needs top $13 billion. Many of Illinois' school districts have a difficult time even buying textbooks and pencils, much less financing major capital improvements. This legislation would free up local resources in my State for education by providing Federal support for rebuilding the schools. 
This $112 billion national school repair price tag, as enormous as it may sound, again, does not include the cost of wiring schools and getting them up to speed for modern technology. One of the greatest barriers to the incorporation of modern computers into classrooms is that the physical condition of many school buildings will not allow for it. You cannot very well use a computer if you cannot plug it into the wall. 
Again, to quote the General Accounting Office, almost half of all schools lack enough electrical power for the full-scale use of computers; 60 percent of them lack enough conduits in the school to connect classroom computers to a network; and 60 percent of schools lack enough phone lines for instructional use. 
Last year, a teacher from Waukegan, IL, came to Washington and was talking about the use of computers in the school and that when they plugged in the computers, when they deployed the computers around the school, fires started all through the school because the wiring was so old. 
That situation is replicating itself all over the country. We are seeing situations in which the schools cannot give our children the tools they need to learn so that they can compete in this 21st century because the physical structures simply will not allow it. 
This legislation also will give communities the power to relieve overcrowding. Again, according to the Department of Education, enrollment this year is at an all-time high and will continue to grow over the next 10 years. Just to keep up with growing enrollment, we will need to build 6,000 new schools over the next 10 years. 
Again, in my State, I visited schools where study halls are held in the hallways because there is no other space. I have seen stairway landings converted into computer labs, cardboard partitions used to turn one classroom into two. There is one school where the lunchroom has been converted into two classrooms, where the students eat in the gymnasium, and instead of gym, they have what is called `adaptive physical education' while they stand next to their desks. 
One youngster from Virginia talked about the fact that the congestion in his school is so profound that the kids get into fights in the hallway, and they call it `hall rage,' when there is just too much human presence for them to walk around the hallways and they get into disruptive behavior. 
The teachers and parents know full well these conditions directly affect the ability of their children to learn, and the research, of course, has backed up that intuition. Two separate studies found a 10 to 11 percent achievement gap between students who attend school in good buildings and quality surroundings and those who attend school in poor buildings after accounting for all 
other factors. 
Other studies have found that when the buildings are in poor condition, again, the students are more likely to misbehave. Three leading researchers recently concluded: 
There is no doubt but that building condition affects academic performance. 
Again, if we are going to address the need to provide our youngsters with quality education, we clearly have to look at the factors and the environment in which they are called upon to learn. 
Just last month, the results came in on a set of international math and science tests. The results were, quite frankly, profoundly disturbing. 
The results of that study placed American students at or near the bottom on every one of the math and science tests that were offered. This cannot be. We cannot go into the 21st century with our children performing below some less-industrialized countries because we do not provide a quality educational opportunity and, frankly, consistent educational opportunity throughout the country. 
We know that we have some of the best schools in the world in this country on the one hand. I have some that I visited in the State of Illinois--the First in the World School. Those schools are in good condition, and the youngsters who go there have a great opportunity for education. They have scored above the international norm. 
But at the same time we have the other instance of the crumbling schools, the dilapidated conditions and the poor performance across the board as well. We have this patchwork quilt of school facilities throughout the country. Again, I point out these facilities' problems are related to how we finance the system, how we pay for schools. 
Crumbling schools are not just accidents; they are the predictable result of the way we fund education. The current system was established a century ago when the Nation's wealth was measured in terms of landholdings. Wealth, of course, is no longer accumulated just in land, and the funding mechanism relying on the local property tax is just not appropriate, nor is it adequate. 
The current school finance structure works against most American children and mitigates against most families' best efforts to improve local schools. Again, according to the General Accounting Office, poor and middle-class schools try the hardest to raise the revenue to get the money together to fix up their schools. But the system works against them. 
In some 35 States, poor districts have higher tax rates than wealthy districts, but they raise less revenue because, of course, there is less property wealth to tax. Now, this local funding model does not work for school infrastructure, just as it would not work for highways or other infrastructure. 
Imagine for a moment what would happen if we based our system of roads on the same funding model that we use for schools. If every community was responsible for the construction of and maintenance of the roads within its borders and no one else contributed, where we did not have a partnership, we relied on the local property tax, in all likelihood we would have smooth, good roads in the wealthy towns, a patchwork of mediocre roads in middle-income towns, and very few roads at all in poor communities. 
Transportation, then, Mr. President, would be hostage to the vagaries of wealth and geography. Commerce and travel would be difficult and navigation of such a system would not serve the interests of our whole country. 
Mr. President, unfortunately, that hypothetical situation that I have just described in terms of roads precisely describes our school funding system. Schools with a lot of wealth have good schools or are more likely to have good schools, middle-class schools have a patchwork, poor communities have little or nothing to point to. 
Again, I made the point, as the GAO found, that the phenomenon of crumbling schools, the infrastructure, finds itself in all kinds of communities, suburban, rural and urban, but, again, it is based on the local property tax in the main. 
The American Society of Civil Engineers released a report card on America's infrastructure, and, again, they found that the only category to get an F was the schools. 
We have just recently acted, and the ranking member, the Senator from New Jersey, will point out that we just passed the ISTEA bill, the highway and mass transit bill, which addresses a number of these issues. The Senate passed that bill almost with unanimous support, and we put an additional $214 billion into infrastructure in that legislation. 
Schools, however, do not benefit from that bill, and that is why I believe we need to talk about a partnership to fund the 
redevelopment of our school infrastructure. Our children need the same level of commitment for school infrastructure as we have given to our highways. 
I think the way we ought to look at this is not in the sense of finger pointing, saying it is the fault of the States or it is the fault of the local governments. I think, if anything, we need to engage a partnership in which we all contribute and we all weigh in to try to fix these schools and give our children an environment that is worthwhile to learn in. 
We have a situation in which States--the argument has been made that school construction is just a State or a local responsibility. Some of my colleagues have argued that, notwithstanding the fact that the school districts face a maintenance backlog of $112 billion--and, again, $73 billion in new school construction needed--the States can meet these costs on their own and by themselves. 
The truth is that this is not in the interest of our country, that we rely on the accident of State effort and the accident of geography and the accident of wealth in order to make certain that we address this national problem. 
We have an interest, as citizens of this great country, to see to it that every child gets an opportunity to learn, that every child gets an environment in which learning can take place, and that every child no matter where they live in the United States is given a chance to take advantage of the new technologies that school modernization would allow. 
The General Accounting Office found that only 13 of the States take a comprehensive approach to school modernization and construction. In 1994, for example, the States spent a total of $3.5 billion on school repair and construction--$3.5 billion. So again with $112 billion worth of deferred maintenance, $73 billion worth of needed new construction, the States alone will simply not be able to bear that economic burden. 
Some of my colleagues have argued that because the economy is doing so well the States are now in a position to supplement what they spend on school facilities with funds from the surpluses that are beginning to accumulate in the State treasuries. Most States have a surplus. All but two States had some sort of surplus at the end of fiscal year 1997, ranging from a $3.2 billion surplus in Alaska to a $32 million surplus in Alabama. My own State of Illinois ended 1997 with a $108 million surplus. But the sum total of all the surpluses put together is $28.2 billion. If we were to spend every dime of every State's surplus on this issue, you would just begin to make a dent in it. 
I think that the notion of the finger-pointing, the notion of blaming one level of Government or another, is something that we, frankly, do not have time for. We do not have time for that argument any longer. I believe we have a responsibility to engage as a national community to work together, giving the States and the local governments control, certainly, giving them responsibility for making certain that the schools are rebuilt, but providing the financial help that we can at the national level in the simplest way possible. 
We have the capacity, at the national level, to provide the funding leverage that this legislation will provide that will cost us $3 billion to allow these local communities and school districts to go into the capital markets and raise $22 billion. I think it just makes absolute sense, and I encourage my colleagues to support this sense-of-the-Senate amendment. 
Mr. President, I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, 2 minutes to the Senator from Washington, and such time to the Senator from California as she may require.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the Senator from California for her eloquence. I did, however, want to take issue with one little part. This is just a sense of the Senate, but the underlying legislation does relate to suburban and rural schools as well as city schools. The Senator is right about the urban schools. It does a lot more for urban schools than the alternative legislation, but it also covers suburban and rural, because in my State, of course, just outside of Chicago is a place called Illinois, so I have to make sure that is covered. 
In fact, if I may, for a moment, pick up where the Senator from California left off, this is a picture from a suburban school. This is outside of Chicago. You can see it is a portable classroom. The doors are falling off, and the gutters are down on the ground. It is in a dilapidated condition. So we see it all over. 
Senator Feinstein was exactly right to point out how much will be required for new construction, in addition to fixing the crumbling schools we have already. The GAO points out that we need $112 billion just to repair the schools that are falling down. They also found, however, that we have about $73 billion worth of need for new schools. So what we are really looking at is not just the $112 billion price tag, but a $185 billion price tag. 
If you take the argument that somehow this is a local responsibility, it should come out of local property taxes, then what you are really saying is that the local property taxpayers should cough up an additional $185 billion--$185 billion. When you consider that property taxes around the country have been increasing, frankly, at a greater rate than the taxes at the national level have increased, State and local taxes, as a share of income, have risen nearly 10 percent in the last decade. In the last 10 years alone, in my State of Illinois, the property taxes have more than doubled. All across the country, voters reject the property tax hikes to pay for schools and other municipal improvements. 
Again, we cannot continue to rely on the property tax alone to build the schools that we need for the next century. I think what is called for here is a partnership--a partnership in which we come together and work together at the Federal, State, and local government level to provide the funding that will be required to help rebuild our crumbling schools. 
Mr. President, just yesterday a Manhattan State Supreme Court 
justice ordered New York City and the New York Board of Education to eliminate hazardous school conditions and to begin regular inspections and maintenance of its 1,200 school buildings. That decision came out of a lawsuit brought on the issue of the crumbling schools. According to that report that was commissioned by the New York board, 40 percent of the schools in New York lack functioning or accessible bathrooms and water fountains with clean water; 760 buildings had serious heating and ventilation problems; an average of 47 percent of the schools in New York are falling into unacceptable disrepair. 
Again, this is the kind of dilapidation we are seeing all over. In fact, there is litigation pending in another 16 States on this point. I think this amendment we are considering today expressing the sense of the Senate will go in the right direction. 
The point I believe we have to make is that it is appropriate for us at the national level to stop pointing fingers, to stop the divisive blame game that stalls Federal support for school improvements, and that we all have a responsibility to come together and work on this. I am pleased that Senator Feinstein came to the floor to discuss this matter. It was my understanding that the Senator from New Jersey wanted to speak on this matter. I yield to him.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Yes. I thank the Senator from New Jersey. I was just going to ask if this colloquy was being charged to time on this side because the junior Senator from New Jersey wanted to speak, and I wanted to have an opportunity to close. We are 10 minutes from the hour of 2 o'clock, and I understand there is a vote scheduled by unanimous consent for that time. In just trying to accommodate the time, I was wondering if it was being charged to the time of the proponents of this amendment.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the Senator from New Jersey. 
In summation, Mr. President, we have heard some of the stories. There are many other anecdotal stories, stories even in my State about faucets and drains in science labs that don't work and electrical wiring that can't support the computers, a school in Alabama where the water leaks collapsed the ceiling 40 minutes after the children left for the day. 
These stories, frankly, are news to no one. I hope that this Senate will take a good look at the sense of the Senate and not let this vote come down on truly partisan grounds. I have a sense that it will, and that in my opinion is tragic because, if anything, our children are not Republican or Democrat or Independent. Our children require an education, and politics should stop at the schoolroom door. This should be something that would engage nonpartisan support based on the policy objective of the sense-of-the-Senate amendment. 
That is what this vote is about. It is about policy. I hope it is not about politics. I hope we will send a signal that we are prepared, because, again, it is only a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, that we will send a signal to the country that this Congress is prepared to take up the challenge of rebuilding our crumbling schools; that we are prepared to do it in partnership with our State and local governments; we are not looking to local property taxpayers alone to carry the burden of the $185 billion it will take to build and repair schools; that we are not going to try to pass the buck to the States and have them raise State taxes to do it; that we can work together to provide a bureaucracy free of raising the capital. 
That is all this amendment does. It doesn't tell anybody which school to fix. All it says is here is a way to raise the money, and Uncle Sam is going to give you a tax credit in lieu of interest on these bonds that the local school districts will issue. I think it makes absolute sense. It is a very straightforward way of doing it. It will provide support for all kinds of schools in rural and suburban districts as well as in urban districts where the needs, of course, are the most pronounced, but certainly they are pronounced all over the country. 
I encourage my colleagues to support the sense-of-the-Senate amendment, and I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his indulgence, for allowing additional time to talk about this issue because it is such an important issue and we were limited by virtue of the agreement on this budget discussion so we did not get the time to really go through all the details. But I did want to pick up on a couple points that were made while the Senator from North Dakota spoke. He was so eloquent in his support of the legislation. But he touched on two themes that I would like to touch on or respond to now. 
The first one goes to, whose job is it? Whose responsibility is it to see to it that our children go to school in environments that are suitable for learning? Whose fault is it? Whose fault is it that we have crumbling schools, that we have schools that fall below building codes? We have schools where the ceilings are falling in because of faulty plumbing. We have schools where the wiring is insufficient to maintain a computer. We have schools with broken windows in this country. 
Almost fully a third of the schools, according to the General Accounting Office, fall below the code standards, decent environments for learning, just basic kinds of facilities requirements. This is not bells and whistles. This is not anything exceptional, just the basic level of facilities and infrastructure. Almost a third of the schools in this country fall below that level. 
So as you go through the debate, a lot of this debate really comes down to, whose fault is it that it is this way? And what the sense-of-the-Senate amendment proposes is that we stop playing the game, the blame game, that we stop trying to pass the buck, that we stop trying to point the finger to assess the blame, to make it somebody else's problem, because, indeed, the children of this country are all of our problem. 
We will not be able to maintain the standard of living that we all talk about and maintain as the American dream, we will not be able to maintain that American dream into the next century if we do not give every one of our children an opportunity to learn, if we do not give every child the best access to education that we can possibly make available to them. Quite frankly, we cannot give quality education to children in school buildings that are literally falling down. 
It should be intuitive to everybody in this Chamber, but beyond intuition, the fact is that the studies actually have confirmed that performance is directly related to the condition of the environment in which learning is supposed to take place. 
Children who go to schools that are falling down consistently score below children in quality facilities, across the board, on all the tests. We should have gotten a warning call as a nation just a couple weeks ago when the results came in on the international tests in math and science. What those results said to us was that the United States has fallen behind 
most industrialized countries. 
The United States scored below Slovenia. I do not mean to disparage Slovenia, but we scored below Slovenia in math and in science. How can we possibly expect to compete in this global economy with this kind of laissez faire attitude, this kind of neglect, this kind of, I would even suggest, triage of our children, that leaves their education up to how much their parents happen to be able to afford? 
That gets to the point of--there was a chart over there, and it has kind of fallen. I do not know where it went. I actually would like to use it for a second. It was on the opponents' side. It was a quote from one of the White House assistants in 1996 when this proposal got cut out of the budget. In spite of the fact that the White House said at the time they were in support, the fact is--and everybody in this room knows; and I am not embarrassed about it anymore--that the White House said, `Well, we have some other priorities. We can't afford to do this now.' So they punted on the school construction proposal. They essentially let it get cut out at the table because there was opposition on the other side of the aisle, and the majority objected to it. The White House said, `OK, fine. We'll let it go.' So the proposal fell once again that time just under the circumstances of that debate. 
But that loss, in my opinion, should have just been temporary because, if nothing else has happened, I think in the ensuing years people have had a chance to take a look at the whole question of whose fault it is and whose responsibility it is. The truth is, we cannot just expect to pay for rebuilding our crumbling schools based on the local property tax. 
Right now our school finance structure proceeds from the local property tax. That is one of the reasons why we have this patchwork of schools across the country. In much the same way General Eisenhower, when he set up the Interstate Highway System, concluded that the only way we were going to serve the national interest in transportation from one end of the country to the other was to have a system that had some congruence and some core communication and some networking, if you will, to it. So we were able then to get around the wealth of a specific community by saying we are going to have one good road that takes us from one end of this country to the other. 
Well, so it is with facilities. If we just rely on the local property tax, we will be forced then to have a school system where in wealthy communities there will be good faculties, in middle class communities there will be a patchwork of full school facilities, and in poor communities there will be school facilities with broken windows and falling bricks and leaky roofs. That is the situation we are in. And that is the situation we have come to. 
Let me suggest this debate and this sense of the Senate does not say that State and local governments do not have a role to play or that we should take this up as a new program for the Federal Government. Indeed, we should not. If anything, this calls on all levels of government to go into a partnership, to work together, to collaborate, to get beyond the blame game and the finger pointing and the skirting of responsibility, to say let us work together to make this happen, to fix these crumbling schools. 
The property taxes have already--already--been rising. In fact, State and local taxes as a share of income have risen nearly 10 percent--nearly 10 percent. And the increase in 
State and local taxes has been greater than the increase in Federal taxes. It is stunning. People think, `Oh, taxes are terrible.' Well, most of the tax hikes have come at the State and local level. This is going to dawn in the general conversation fairly soon, I suspect, because the problem is not coming from here, it is coming because we are pushing off to State and local governments a lot of responsibility that we could help them with. That is the point, not that we are going to take it over; we can help them. 
Indeed, if we do not create a more equitable partnership to modernize our schools, the local property taxpayers will have to come up with an additional $153 billion--$153 billion. This sense of the Senate suggests that we have that partnership, that we work together, that we provide some financial assistance to local governments, that we provide an opportunity for them to give some relief of the local property taxes, that we support State efforts to rebuild the schools, that we work together for our children, because they are all our children and we have a stake as citizens of this great country in the education of each and every one of them. 
It seems to me that if we form this partnership, we will be able to meet this challenge, we will be able to provide our children with decent facilities, we will be able to give them the tools they need to take up the challenges of this technological age of their time. 
I thank the ranking member for giving me this time. It appears that the majority is prepared to take the floor. But I yield back to the Senator from New Jersey. I thank the Senator so much for his support of this. He has been a builder. I have to say one thing about the Senator from New Jersey. He likes and he understands the importance of infrastructure; of the basics; of making certain that our roads are good in this country, because that is how business gets done; of making certain that we have infrastructure with the bridges so we do not have accidents, so that people can get from one place to the other, can get to work; of making certain that our children have the quality education and that the infrastructure is adequate to that end. 
It seems to me that there can be no more fundamental priority for us. And this is an opportunity for us to provide for educational excellence, again, in collaboration and cooperation and in partnership with State and local governments on ways in which they retain control. There is not a lot of bureaucracy with the proposal. Actually, this is not a proposal. The sense of the Senate is so general, I would expect it to have unanimous--it could very well, if it were not so partisan an issue, it could very well have unanimous support in this Senate. It should have. It should have. 
The politics, frankly, should stop at the schoolroom door, and it should stop on something like a sense of the Senate that just says, look, this makes sense for us to do. It does not legislate, it does not mandate, it does not dictate anything. A sense-of-the-Senate amendment, as the Presiding Officer knows, is just a statement of what we think is the right thing to do. 
And I hope that we could have unanimous support for the right thing to do by our children, by our school facilities. I hope to have 99, if not 100, votes. It would be very nice. But I am a realist in this matter. I know that it is going to fall prey to partisan politics. I think that is a shame too, because I really think the time when we 
have to just have these partisan divides on these kinds of issues, that time has passed. 
I think the American people have gotten to the point where they are tired of the blame game, they are tired of the finger pointing, they are tired of the argument, the argument of, `This is what's wrong with America, and isn't this a shame?' Let us move to the constructive, to the positive, and talk about what is right with America, what is right with our generation. Our generation is as capable as any of the generations that have gone before us of meeting the challenges of our times. I submit to you that this crumbling school initiative is precisely such a challenge. 
When I went to school, we were in schools largely my parents' generation built, my grandparents' generation built. What is our generation going to leave as its legacy to the kids? Schools based on whether or not your parents are wealthy? Schools based on whether or not you live in a community that has a big shopping center so there are a lot of property taxes? Are we going to just leave it to an accident of geography whether or not a youngster has a chance to be educated in a decent facility? I hope not. 
I hope we take advantage of this opportunity and see this sense-of-the-Senate amendment as an opportunity--as an opportunity--for us to come together as Americans for something that we all believe is the right thing to do. 
I want to again thank the Senator from New Jersey. I yield to the Senator from New Jersey and thank him again for his indulgence and for all of his great support in this matter.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. In the first instance, this sense of the Senate does not prescribe a level. The sense-of-the-Senate amendment is conceptual; it does not go to $3.3 billion. That is the underlying legislation that has that figure in it. 
How do we get so much for so little? That is a very good question. I will tell you how. What we do is provide the issuers of the zero coupon bonds with the ability to give, basically, a tax break to purchasers of the bonds. So instead of having even an interest rate buydown, an individual will get a tax credit when they buy one of these instruments. They will get a tax credit instead of interest. That will allow for the leveraging to the $22 billion or thereabouts of the bond issue.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. $21.8 billion. The $3 billion I mentioned will leverage into $21.8 billion worth of these bonds over the next 2 years. Again, it is calling for a partnership. It calls for private-sector investment--private-sector investment--in helping to rebuild these schools. It is not all out of the Treasury. It is largely the private sector stepping forward and saying, `As purchasers of these instruments, we want to help achieve a national goal.'

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. We have the tradition of paying for those things that are authorized out of the Finance Committee. 
We passed a bill last night that wasn't fully paid for, as I know the distinguished Senator from New Mexico is aware. However, yes, we would have to find the `pay for.' There is no question about it. Whether or not that would come out of some of the various revenue streams mentioned in connection with the bill we passed out last night or some other--we can be innovative. The chairman of the Finance Committee is sitting here, and he is one of the most innovative persons I know in coming up with things like that. We can work together to find the revenue stream to support the $3.3 billion. It is a small price to leverage $21 billion of private-sector investment to achieve the goal of helping to start down the path of meeting this $112 billion worth of deferred maintenance.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am very proud to introduce this legislation along with my colleague, Chairman D'Amato. The establishment of this commission is the next logical step in the work we have been doing on this issue, and it is something that should have been done in 1948 rather than 1998. 
This bill will establish an independent Presidential Commission to comprehensively examine issues pertaining to the disposition of Holocaust assets in the United States before, during, and after World War II. It will investigate the disposition of Holocaust victims' assets in the United States, including but not limited to: dormant bank accounts, securities, bonds, insurance policies, artwork, and German-looted gold shipped to the U.S. through the Tripartite Gold Commission, as revealed in the Eizenstat report. The Commission will issue reports, and make recommendations to the President on further action. 
The amount of assets the Commission finds is likely to be significantly smaller than that discovered in other countries, but there are certainly assets here. This matter even touches my hometown of Chicago. Currently, there is a dispute about the origins of a Degas pastel, `Landscape with Smokestacks,' owned by a trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago. Heirs of Freidrich and Louise Guttman, who were killed by the Nazis, are litigating this issue and expect to have a verdict later this spring. 
It is vitally important that the U.S. lead by example. As citizens of the world, we must ensure that all of the relevant financial transactions of this era are brought to light. Then, as now, those who enslave their own populations often try to use the international banking system to further their own illegitimate ends. We cannot fully avoid repeating the tragedies of history until we have entirely uncovered and have a full understanding of the past. 
We all have a responsibility to deal with the consequences of that horrific act, no matter how much time has passed, and no matter how much effort it takes. We have an obligation to ensure that the Swiss, and other neutral countries that played a role in hiding the stolen possessions of innocent Jewish families continue to work with the U.S. so that restitution is made. The vast majority of our work in the Committee focused on the actions of other countries, especially the Swiss banks. Now it is time to look in the mirror. In the Eizenstat report, released last year, we learned that the actions of the United States before, during and after the war were not all that could have been desired. I am saddened to learn that America did not work as hard as it could to ensure compensation for Holocaust survivors and other refugees, but I realize that the goal of that report was to unearth the truth, and that is what it has done, and what we will continue to do with the establishment of this Commission. 
Already, a dozen countries have formed similar commissions. This is due in no small part to the leadership role the United States has taken in searching for the truth. We would not have come this far without the commitment of the Clinton Administration, the efforts of the Senate Banking Committee and, especially, the tenaciousness of our Committee Chairman, Alfonse D'Amato. 
Over the past several years, the Banking Committee has held many hearings on the disposition of the assets of Holocaust victims. Each hearing has brought to light valuable but distressing information about events surrounding the tragedy that was the Holocaust. It has been over 50 years since the nightmare of the Holocaust, during which, over 7 million Jewish men women and children were stripped of their homes, businesses, their possessions, the very clothes off their backs and, ultimately, their lives--by a government that industrialized death and literally attempted to exterminate the Jewish people. 
We have made a tremendous step through our commitment to finding the truth. We must now commit to work together to do everything possible to put whatever assets belonging to victims or survivors into the proper hands before it is too late. Time is of the essence. With the passing of each day, the few remaining Holocaust survivors continue to age and their numbers decrease. This is why it is imperative that we enact this legislation quickly and allow this commission to begin work as soon as possible. 
It will not be possible to track down every asset, but complete success is not required. What is required is that everyone who had a role in this tragedy does their best to right the wrongs that have been committed, and that they understand that much more than money is at stake.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Just to put in context what this debate is and is not about in regard to Senator Murray's amendment, and there will, of course, be other amendments on education seeking to bring this issue to the attention of the American people, and hopefully to give us an opportunity to actually legislate. 
The issue here starts from the fact that as we went into the budget negotiations, the Republican majority cut $1.6 billion from the President's request for elementary and secondary education. Unfortunately, this has become not only a partisan debate among and between the parties here in the Senate but it really is a debate that, in my opinion, is kind of like trying to find out who to blame for the fact that elementary and secondary education is not receiving the kind of support nationally it ought to receive. 
My mother used to have an expression, `When you point a finger at somebody, you have three pointing back at yourself.' I think nothing describes this debate around education as much as that expression. The fact is that there is an awful lot of finger-pointing going on in regard to education--whose responsibility it is, whose fault it is, who should do what, instead of a sense that the real answer here lies in our ability as a nation to come together, to work together, to cooperate, to collaborate, to form partnerships to address an issue that is in our national interests. 
There is no question that education is a core value for our country. It correlates with opportunity, opportunity not just for individuals but for America as a whole. That notion of opportunity, I think, goes to the heart of what it is about to be an American. Frankly, the rungs of opportunity are crafted in the classroom. Public education has made this the greatest country in the world, and if we don't engage in this together to work out the challenges to public education, we will see that American dream erode in our lifetime. I do not think that is something any American parent wants to see. I think that every parent, every citizen, wants to see us engage, regarding this issue, in ways that serve the public interests and in ways that do justice and honor to our generation's stewardship of this great country. That is the core issue, I think, in all of this debate and in what it is we are debating with regard to Senator Murray's amendment, as well as others. 
First, I will for a moment sketch out in terms of the dollar value of an education, first to individuals. There is no question; studies have shown us that high school graduates earn 
46 percent more every year than those who do not graduate, that college graduates earn 155 percent more every year than those who do not complete high school, and over the course of a lifetime the most educated Americans will earn five times as much as the least educated Americans. So education correlates directly to an individual's well-being. In fact, it correlates to almost every indicia of economic and social well-being. Educational attainment can be tied directly to income, to health, to the likelihood of being on welfare, to the likelihood of being incarcerated, and even to the likelihood of an individual voting and participating in our democracy. 
Education, however, is more than a tool just to lift people out of poverty or to give them a better standard of living. It is the engine that will drive America's economy into the 21st century. In a Wall Street Journal survey last year of leading U.S. economists, 43 percent of them said that the single most important thing we can do to increase our long-term economic growth would be to invest more in education, research, and development. Nothing else came close to the indicia of what will help our economy do well. One economist said, `One of the few things that economists will agree upon is the fact that economic growth is very strongly dependent on our own abilities.' 
In a recent study by the Manufacturing Institute, the conclusion was reached that increasing the education level of workers by 1 year raises the productivity level in manufacturing by 8.5 percent. So making certain that we invest in education is something that we ought to do not just for the children who will be benefited but for our country and for the economy as a whole. 
There are those who say that is fine, that is all well and good, but in any event it is not our job to do. In fact, this $1.6 billion cut, as Senator Murray pointed out, means we will spend in this budget, this 1998 budget, a full 2 percent on education; 2 percent is the Federal contribution out of this budget to education. That is so because a number of people argue that it is not the Federal Government's job to be involved with financially supporting elementary and secondary education. They point the finger and say it is somebody else's job. 
Let's take a look at who else's job it might be. Some of our colleagues say the economy is doing so well, the States should do it, that the States are now in a position to supplement what they spend on education because they have surpluses accumulating in their economy. Well, the truth is that even if the States were to stretch out, to use all of their surplus, that would not be enough money to provide the support to rebuild crumbling schools, to reduce class size, to give teachers the tools they need, to give children what they need to actually be able to get the kind of world-class economy that I believe we have to provide for every American child. 
All but two of the States had at least some surplus at the end of fiscal year 1997, ranging from a $3.2 billion surplus in Alaska to a $32 million surplus in Alabama. My own State of Illinois ended 1997 with an $806 million surplus. Of course, the sum total of all the States' surpluses at the end of fiscal year 1997 was $28.2 billion. 
In addition--and this is not on the class size debate but efforts with regard to rebuilding the schools--the General Accounting Office tells us that just to bring the 
schools in this country up to code we have to spend $112 billion. Well, you don't have to have a whole lot of education to do the math on that one. If all the surpluses taken together are $28.2 billion, that doesn't begin to even address the issue of funding $112 billion worth of need just to get the facilities up to code. So if you are talking again about reducing class size, as well as fixing crumbling schools and the other things that the schools will need, the $28 billion surpluses of the States will not do it. 
Assuming that every State were to maintain its past effort, and in addition spend every penny of its surplus on schools, they would still be left with a huge amount of needs, $153 billion worth of needs in terms of school construction, and again the costs of reducing class size. 
Then there are those who say, OK, it is not just the State's job. In any event, it is not just the State's job to do this. It is really a matter of each community weighing in and fixing up their schools. That translates into an argument that the full costs of education or the bulk of the cost of education ought to come out of the property taxes. 
I don't know if you noticed, but the property tax is a singularly inelastic tax--without doubt, the worst place to try to fund a school system. And what we have seen over time is that the property tax has been inadequate to fund education. In fact, it has given rise to what Jonathan Kozol referred to as `Savage Inequalities.' That is to say, in the communities where the demographics support an easily tapped property tax, where there are nuclear power plants or shopping centers, those communities can afford to support their schools with relatively little effort from individual taxpayers, whereas other school districts where there are a number of retirees or poor people have a harder time supporting their schools. So relying on the property tax alone, or largely relying on the property taxes, is one of the reasons why we have such a patchwork in terms of the quality of schools in this country. There is no coherence. There is no systematic support for education from the local property tax. So we have a situation where the local property tax is stretched beyond what it can bear in terms of providing for education. The States are doing an inadequate job in support of education, and this budget gives us all of a 2 percent Federal contribution to that challenge. Small wonder, Mr. President, that the United States is beginning to lose ground worldwide in education. 
Just a couple weeks ago we had a report on the performance of students in this country on math and science exams. It should have been a wake-up call to everybody when we found that the U.S. students, in some categories--in physics--came in dead last, dead last. We came in below Slovenia on mathematics. We are doing poorly on all of these indicia of international measurements of competency in the schools. 
Given this patchwork quilt, given the results of the finger-pointing, small wonder that our kids are not doing as well as they should or that they could. Let me make a point about that. I think the point has to be made that our children, American kids, are just as capable as kids anywhere in the world of learning, if they are given an opportunity. 
They are as capable of doing as much as any other community on this planet, if given the opportunity. The direction that we take, the decisions we make in this Senate will in large part determine what direction we take to get there, to get to the point of giving them an opportunity. Will we support a partnership in which we come together at the Federal, the State, and the local level? Or will we take the position that everybody have at it and do the best job you can, wherever you are, and make educational opportunity an accident of geography and an accident of someone's situation in life, whether their parents were born wealthy. I don't believe we can afford to waste a single mind, to waste a single child's talent. We have a responsibility as Americans to come together as parents and stop this finger pointing, stop this blame game and put this argument aside and recognize that it is in our national security interest that we give every child the ability to be educated to the maximum extent of his or her ability. 
Mr. President, I commend Senator Murray for her activity on the Budget Committee in this regard, for her advocacy for children. She has been an advocate across the board on a variety of issues. I submit that there is no issue on which advocacy can be more important than the direction we take in education in this country. 
I believe the bottom-line question here is whether or not we are prepared to face the fact that we cannot go it alone, we cannot point fingers, and we cannot allow for a child's educational opportunities to depend on the accident of where they were born. We have a responsibility to come together as Americans to make certain that all levels of government contribute to the maximum extent we can so that local governments, parents, communities, people at the local level can provide the children who live there with the best possible opportunity. 
We can do better than 2 percent. I submit that we ought to restore the $1.6 billion the President proposed, restore that to the budget and have a debate on how we send that out to the States. We ought to be able to send it to the States and the school districts without a whole lot of strings or bureaucracy. Nobody is hiring $1.6 billion worth of new bureaucrats. We are talking about sending money directly to benefit the schools. I believe we have not only an opportunity to do that, but an obligation to do it. The opportunity is with us because we have a balanced budget. After decades of wallowing in red ink, we have a budget surplus--or at least we are on a glidepath from deficit territory. It seems to me, if we are going to look at the priorities of this country, no priority comes higher than providing for education, no priority comes higher than providing States and local communities with the support they need to give our children a chance. 
Therefore, I commend Senator Murray. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I wanted to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from Washington. Every politician who runs for office runs on an education platform. I don't know a Governor in this country who hasn't run on an education platform. I don't know a Senator in this country who hasn't run on an education platform. Somewhere out there, there is probably a coroner and a dogcatcher who will run on an education platform. And yet education doesn't have the financial support at any level that it needs to have. That should be evident in how we are coming in on these international tests and exams. The response that I see from all too many of my colleagues is to say, as the Senator so eloquently put it, public education has failed, let's run away from it. The old runaway response is not a response, because we can't afford to triage, to waste a single child. 
Again, I commend my colleague for requiring some of us to put our money where our mouths are, that we really support education and begin to vote for education and fund education and to put real meat on the bone of our commitment to public education.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Dodd for his important leadership on this issue. I am a cosponsor of his child care ACCESS bill and I am proud to join him in supporting this amendment. 
I have been on this floor already today talking about the importance of education and how closely educational attainment is tied to every indicia of well being. From an individual's physical health to the nation's economic health, education is the key. 
With this amendment, we turn to the issue of child care. I submit that adequate public and private funding for child care is a necessary foundation for educational attainment and economic well being at every level. Children who are not well cared for have trouble thriving and succeeding in school and in life. Parents who cannot find or afford decent child care cannot work or are less productive and reliable when they are working. We all suffer when good, safe child care is not available. 
Children who have the opportunity to learn and grow with adult care and attention will do better throughout their lives. Recent studies have confirmed that the first three years of a child's life are the most critical in a child's development. For a child, it is these first three years that have, as a Carnegie study stated, `. . . a decisive, long-lasting impact on their well-being and ability to learn.' 
There are many child care alternatives for families ranging from small, home care settings to child care centers with low child to teacher ratios to a stay-at-home mother or father--but only if the families can afford them. The key to successful child care is that the parents have choices about how to best care for their children. For too many American families the high cost of child care puts options out of their reach. 
In Illinois, full-day child care can cost from $4,000 to $10,000 per year for just one child. This can be compared to the cost of a college tuition at the University of Illinois of just over $4,000. These high costs often force parents into unsafe choices. A recent national study found that 40 percent of the rooms used to provide care for infants in child care centers provided care that was so poor as to put the child's health, safety or development at risk. Only 8 percent were rated as providing quality care for infants and toddlers. These statistics do not even take into account those parents who cannot find care at all. In Chicago, for example, a 1995 report found the demand for child care for infants exceeded the supply. 
Without choices, parents are unable to work, have to forgo needed family income, or are unable to devote their full time and attention to their work. The lack of choices not only affects the family but has a direct and negative impact on the economy as a whole in public assistance and lost productivity costs. 
A 1991 study for the Illinois Department of Public Aid, for instance, found that for single parents in Illinois receiving welfare, child care problems kept 42 percent of them from working full time. Twenty percent of those women who worked but returned to welfare within a year were forced back onto welfare because of child care problems. For those who had to quit school, 42 percent left because of child care programs. While the statistics may not be so stark for middle-class families, the effects can be as great. The lack of decent, affordable care crosses economic lines. 
The fiscal year 1999 budget resolution has several provisions for improving child care, but these are tentative and modest compared to the need. This amendment will allow those in the Senate concerned with the lack of child care choices for at-home and working parents to effectively target public and private resources to address the child care crisis. We cannot slam the door on child care as we open the door to the 21st Century. It would be irresponsible. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the minority leader. I also thank the leader for his unstinting efforts to try to work out a compromise that will allow for a balanced debate about the subject matter of amendments from both sides of the aisle. 
The real tragedy here, Mr. President, is that this is one of the most important issues that we will take up this year--the education of our children and how we are going to provide for the development of partnerships between the Federal, State, and local governments, and communities and parents, to provide the best possible education for the children of this country. 
It is a vitally important issue going to our national security as a Nation, our future as a country. Yet, here we are in a situation in which the ideas from this side of the aisle are being shut down, are being foreclosed. We are not having an opportunity to talk about those ideas.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the chairman. 
Mr. President, I rise today to strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution to disapprove the certification of Mexico under the Foreign Assistance Act for Fiscal Year 1998. 
On February 26th, the President certified that Mexico had `fully cooperated' with the United States in its drugfighting activities. 
Even a cursory examination of Mexico's recent anti-drug record demonstrates that it has clearly not earned that certification. 
Because it has become so plentiful in our country, in many areas it is easier to purchase cocaine than cigarettes. Drugs are destroying our children's futures and eating away at the fabric of our society. 
Yesterday it was announced that a new anti-drug strike force created by the city of Chicago and Cook County seized 700 pounds of cocaine worth $40 million in a single home in a Chicago suburb. 
Cook County States Attorney Dick Devine said that the cache of drugs seized was enough to `provide a hit for every man, woman, and child in Chicago.' 
I applaud the strike force for hitting the jackpot in this seizure. They have given law enforcement and our community some hope that we have not become complacent in our efforts to get this poison off of our streets. 
It is plentiful. It is poison. 
The raid was the fourth, and the largest, that the new strike force has conducted since it was created last January. 
To date, it has seized nearly 1,200 pounds of cocaine valued at $66.6 million, along with $4.4 million in cash, jewelry and cars. 
But consider what that strike force is up against. It is astonishing that 700 pounds of cocaine was seized in a single home. Imagine the amount of illegal drugs that are out on the street if the police could seize that much in one residence. 
Local police forces cannot be expected to stand as the primary bulwark against a major international scourge--those drugs should never have been able to make their way into the United States. 
A significant degree of the blame for the fact that huge quantities of drugs continue to enter our country can be directed at the impotence of Mexican government's antidrug efforts. 
Mexico is the primary transit country for cocaine entering the United States from South America, as well as a major source of heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamines. 
The truth is, the Mexican government's efforts to stop the flow of drugs into our country have been insufficient. Consider the fact that last year, heroin seizures in Mexico fell by 68 percent compared with 1996 (from 363 kilos to 115 kilos), and that last year, methamphetamine seizures in Mexico fell by 77 percent compared with 1996 and 92 percent compared with 1995 (from 496 kilos to only 39). 
There is more to this story than just the declining amount of drugs seized by Mexican authorities. Consider the Mexican government's disgraceful institutional response to the problems of drug trafficking and drug-related police corruption: 
Despite the existence since 1980 of a mutual extradition treaty between the United States and Mexico, the Mexican government has not yet surrendered a single one of its nationals to the U.S. Government for prosecution on drug charges. Currently there are 27 outstanding requests for extradition. 
How can Mexican officials argue that it is making progress in the fight against illegal drug trafficking and the corruption that it breeds when, of a total of 870 Mexican federal agents that have been dismissed on drug-related corruption charges, 700 have been rehired and none have been prosecuted? 
In a recent hearing, Benjamin Nelson of the Government Accounting Office stated that `No country poses a more immediate narcotics threat to the United States than Mexico.' He was testifying regarding a recently-released GAO report stating that drug-related corruption of Mexican officials remains `pervasive and entrenched within the criminal justice system.' 
Bilateral Border Task Forces have been crippled by inadequate funding by Mexico, a shortage of full-screened Mexican agents, and the refusal of Drug Enforcement Administration agents to participate so long as Mexico denies them permission to carry firearms for their own protection. Certification for Mexico would clearly represent a slap in the face of DEA agents who have communicated their feeling that little is being done to combat drug trafficking in that nation. 
I am aware that, in a few areas, a degree of progress has 
been made. For instance, Mexico has instituted new vetting procedures for the hiring of police officers and it has entered into an agreement with the United States regarding a bilateral drug strategy. 
Unfortunately, these measures are not sufficient to offset Mexico's otherwise exceptionally poor anti-drug record. 
What is really at issue here is not whether Mexico has met the requirements of the Foreign Assistance Act. It clearly has not. The reason that some hesitate to decertify Mexico is that many other aspects of our relationship with Mexico would change if it were not certified. 
In aid, in trade and in commerce, billion's of dollars in public and private money are at risk with this issue. 
For fiscal year 1998, the U.S. has appropriated $15.38 million in standard foreign assistance to Mexico that would be cut off. This assistance includes funding for programs which seek to stabilize population growth; assist health education initiatives; encourage the environmentally sound use of resources; engender legal reforms related to NAFTA; and strengthen democracy. 
In indirect assistance, Mexico could lose billions of dollars. Mexico's economy would likely be severely affected as financial markets react to the United States vote of no confidence in the government. The United States would be required to withhold support for multilateral development bank loans to Mexico. Also at stake are hundreds of millions of dollars of export financing through the export-import bank. In fiscal year 97, the ExIm Bank authorized $1.05 billion for Mexico that would not be available. 
There would be other financial ramifications, and it would change the nature of our relationship. 
The law providing for certification states in Section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act, that the President must submit to Congress by March 1 of each year a list of major illicit drug producing and transiting countries that he has certified as fully cooperative and therefore eligible to continue to receive U.S. foreign aid and other economic assistance. This sets in motion a 30-calendar day review process in which Congress can disapprove the President's certification and stop U.S. foreign aid and other benefits from going to specific countries. The ball is now in our court. 
If we are concerned about sending signals, disrupting commerce, or chilling our economic partnership with Mexico, then we should admit that this law is not enforceable and we should amend or repeal it. 
Perhaps, under current law, the President's choices are too limited. I know that Senator Hutchison and Senator Domenici would like to pass a law creating a new option for the President that would be known as `Qualified Certification.' 
But if we are going to follow the dictates of the current law, the answer is not to pretend that the facts are other than what they clearly are. 
Mexico has simply not met the standards necessary to qualify for certification. 
We have an obligation to the people of the United States to do everything in our power to stop drugs from coming into the United States. 
So, until Mexico gets tough with its drug traffickers, we must get tough with Mexico. 
Mr. President, this is why I stand here. I have seen firsthand the effects of the poison that is coming across our borders in community after community after community. I have seen families destroyed by the prevalence of cocaine and heroin methamphetamine to the extent that in some communities it is almost easier--the popular wisdom is that it is easier--to get cocaine than it is to get cigarettes. 
We have to at some point stand up and say reality is what it is. We as the Senate have a responsibility to say, our relationships notwithstanding, that you have to do better. And the only way we are going to get that process started is to pass this resolution. 
Last year this debate went on, and we were going to give them a pass for another year. It hasn't gotten any better, Mr. President. 
I encourage strong support for the resolution. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a brief moment to express my condolences to the families of the students and teachers killed or wounded during yesterday's tragic shooting at the Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, AR. The Nation's prayers are with those families today and, of course, the thoughts of all Americans are with the people of the Jonesboro community. It is yet another American community whose residents' lives have been changed forever by children who managed to get access to firearms. 
The attack yesterday was the third multiple killing in a school by a youth under the age of 16 in the last 6 months. Mr. President, these horrific crimes amply demonstrate that we have a responsibility to oppose the proliferation of violence and to stand fast against any effort to make firearms more freely available. Does anyone in their right mind still believe that it is possible to raise children in a society where guns are so easily obtained? It is clear that we cannot protect our children in such a world. They are such easy prey for those who seek to maim and to kill. 
Now, Mr. President, until all the facts have been obtained, it would not be prudent to speculate on the events leading up to the massacre in the school yard yesterday. But this much we do know: We must come together as a society and recommit ourselves to keeping firearms out of the hands of children and guaranteeing that only those people who know how to use guns responsibly have access to them. In order to make our community safer, we must expand programs to train gunowners in the proper use and storage of their weapons. 
I believe that responsible gunowners have nothing to fear from reasonable gun laws, and that is what I think we need to have a debate and talk about, and that is what the majority of us who support reasonable gun control seek to have happen--laws that will help to keep tragedies like the one that happened yesterday in that small community in Arkansas from ever happening again. I think it is appropriate for us to have that debate, given the importance to our children, to their safety, to our liberty and freedom and safety in our communities. 
I yield the floor.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is my special privilege to take this opportunity to honor a woman from my home state of Illinois who has spent her career fighting to improve public education. For almost 25 years, Barbara M. Wheeler has served the students, teachers, and schools of Illinois as a champion of public education. Recently, her devotion and hard work was recognized by her peers when she was named President of the National School Boards Association. 
Ms. Wheeler began her extraordinary career of public service by earning an undergraduate degree in Non-Western History from Saint Dominic College in 1969. In 1972, she received her Illinois Teaching Certificate from Elmhurst College. In 1974, Ms. Wheeler joined the Community High School District 99 Board of Education in Downers Grove, and served as President from 1976 to 1987, and again from 1994 to 1995. In 1980, Ms. Wheeler graduated from the Depaul University College of Law, and served as an Assistant State's Attorney in Cook County from 1980 to 1982 before going into private practice. 
While practicing law, Barbara Wheeler's service to the community continued. She has been an active member of the Illinois Association of School Boards, serving in 18 different positions including President (1987-1989) and Vice President (1985-1987). Additionally, Ms. Wheeler has spoke on educational matters before convention audiences around the nation, and has advised and consulted many groups, including the Chicago Board of Education, 57 school districts across Illinois, the New York School Boards Association and the Institute for Educational Leadership. 
For her outstanding leadership and achievements, Ms. Wheeler has received awards from the Illinois State Board of Education, the Illinois Association of School Administrators, and the Illinois Association of School Boards. 
Education is not the only field which benefits from Ms. Wheeler's talent and energy. She also unselfishly volunteers her time with worthwhile groups such as the Illinois Department on Aging, George Williams College, the Downers Grove Chamber of Commerce and the Downers Grove YMCA. Ms. Wheeler is also a member of the Chicago Bar Association, the Illinois Bar Association and the American Bar Association. 
Barbara Wheeler commands a high level of respect from educators in Illinois and around the country, and her broad understanding of the issues and challenges facing public education demonstrates the level of excellence that she will bring to the office of President of the National School Boards Association. Her advocacy in behalf of our nation's students and schools is a model of action for all Americans to follow. I congratulate her on her recent appointment, and wish her good luck and Godspeed.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, tomorrow, I understand, the Senate will begin debate on S. 1133, probably one of the most important debates on education that this Senate will take up this year. This is a vitally important debate, so I want to take this along with other opportunities to talk about various aspects of the underlying legislation, that is, S. 1133, as well as amendments that I and others intend to offer which we believe represent a better approach to education policy at this time in our Nation's history. 
At the outset, let me say that the underlying bill will allow families to put up to $2,000 a year into special education savings accounts and then allow those families to withdraw those funds to meet the costs of attending private or religious schools, middle schools and high schools. Contributions into these accounts would not be tax deductible, but interest on the accounts would be tax free. 
There are several problems with this proposal, and I would like to discuss them. But I think the most important point was made this afternoon by the minority leader when he asked the question, is that all there is? Given the tremendous need for educational resources, for providing national support for our elementary and secondary schools in this country, given the results just last week of international tests that showed the United States coming in dead last in science and math, below even some Third World countries, given the need of our country to prepare this next generation of Americans for their role and leadership in this world economy, in this technological age, it seems to me we should be able to engage a more appropriate national response to the tremendous need for educational support than this proposal provides. 
In the first instance, the changes made to the Education IRAs by S. 1133 will only give families an average annual benefit of $7. That is to say, the average annual benefit to a family with a child in the public schools will be $7 a year--$7. And that $7 will cost an estimated $1.6 billion over the next 10 years. Seven dollars a year. I think it is appropriate to ask, is that all there is? Is this the best we can come up with in response to the crisis in education our country is facing? 
Mr. President, $7 a year is hardly a windfall for American families. It is not enough to cover the expense in a day, in most instances, of pencils or crayons or construction paper for that matter. But the point is that with $7 we will essentially be providing what some have referred to as leeches to cure a disease. That is to say, we will be draining away resources from our public school system in order to provide an average of $7 a year for parents. That is not good policy. That is not practical. And certainly that is an inadequate response to the challenges we face in education policy. 
Some have argued that the bill is a good idea because it represents savings policy; we want to encourage Americans to save. And, of course, it is almost an article of faith that Americans do not save as much as citizens of other industrialized countries. We want to do everything we can to bolster the savings rate in this country. 
Of course, I agree with that proposition; we do want to encourage people to save. But this is bad savings policy. The purpose of IRAs, individual retirement accounts, is to encourage long-term savings, again, by definition, for retirement. The proposal today makes a mockery of that concept, allowing withdrawals to begin only a few years after contributions have been 
made. It has nothing to do with retirement and has nothing to do with long-term savings. There is no benefit associated with contributions into these education IRAs. It is when the withdrawals are made that the benefit is realized. There are no taxes paid on withdrawals from the accounts, no matter how much the contributions have grown over time. So the benefits, therefore, are directly related to the length of time that the money remains in these accounts. 
By allowing withdrawals only a few years after contributions have started, this bill ensures that the only people who will be able to see any noticeable benefit at all from those accounts will be those who can afford the maximum contribution every year. In other words, the only people who will really benefit from this legislation are the wealthiest eligible Americans. According to the Department of the Treasury, the bill does exactly that; it concentrates the benefits of the legislation into the hands of the wealthy. 
The Treasury Department analyzed a slightly different version of this tax scheme and calculated what we refer to as its distributional effects, that is to say, who gets what from a given proposal. That analysis found that 70 percent of the benefits would go to those Americans in the top 20 percent of the income scale. That is to say, families with annual incomes of at least $93,000. Fully 84 percent of the benefits would go to families making more than $75,000. The poorest people, the poorest families in the country, those at the bottom percent of the income scale, would receive 0.4 percent of the benefits. 
So here we are saying we are going to do something to help education, and we turn the benefit on its head so that those who have the least get the least, those who have the most get the most, not based on ability to support education, not based on children's needs. 
I do want to make it clear that the proposal we will debate tomorrow is slightly different than the proposal on which the Treasury Department estimates are based and so you may hear other figures. But the point has to be made that the distributional effect, the benefit of the bill going to the wealthiest Americans still holds as a valid point of observation with regard to this legislation. 
Another point that was made by the analysis of this bill, this time by the Joint Committee on Taxation, is that more than half of the benefits of the bill would flow to the 12 percent of families whose children are already in private schools. So that is to say, most of the money will go to families with children in private schools. 
There are right now in our country about 46 million children in public schools and about 6 million children in private schools. This bill would direct more than half of its benefits to the families of those 6 million children--half to 6 million, the other half to 46 million children. 
Federal education policy, I believe, should be designed to help to improve the quality of education available to all American children, not just a small group of them. 
I mentioned that this was, in my opinion, bad savings policy, bad tax policy and bad fiscal policy, but I would point out that it is also bad education policy. The bill is a backdoor way of diverting resources from public schools to the private schools. It represents a ploy to dismantle the public schools that, frankly, have made our country what it is today. Public education is central to the American dream of opportunity, and the rungs of the ladder of opportunity have always been crafted in the classroom. The public schools provide an opportunity for every child, no matter how wealthy or how poor. By diverting resources away from the public schools, we diminish the opportunities available to the vast majority of students who will be left then in the public school system. We will be essentially, again using the analogy, using a leech to cure whatever ails the public school system. That is not good education policy, and I think this legislation should therefore be rejected. 
We cannot afford to leave any child behind. This voucher proposal, or tax scheme, whatever you want to call it, in that regard, presumes that a market-based solution will solve such problems that exist within our public school system. The plan presumes that by giving parents money to send their children out of the public schools and into private schools will somehow improve the quality of education available to our children. But by definition markets have winners and losers, and we cannot afford to lose any child in a game of educational roulette, or, more to the point, a game of educational triage in which we spin off or assist people to spin off the better students and the more affluent students into private systems. 
Supporters of similar voucher plans claim that they will help the neediest children the most. Research, experience, and common sense suggest otherwise. Researchers have concluded that academically and socially disadvantaged students are less likely to benefit from school voucher programs. Voucher programs in Britain, in France, the Netherlands and Chile confirm this research. They led to increased economic and social segregation of students. They widened the gap between students, instead of narrowing it. In Chile, performance actually declined for low-income students. Of course, that is not surprising, because any use of public funds of this magnitude for private schools will require that fewer resources will be available to be devoted to public schools. Since the vast majority of low-income students will remain in the public schools, and the worst of these schools are for the most part already sorely underfunded, it makes sense that private school vouchers would further weaken the public school system. 
Supporters of using Federal funds to support private schools claim that those schools are better managed, that they perform better and they cost less than the public schools. Again, the facts show otherwise. While it is true that some public schools are inefficient, vouchers, again, do not solve that problem; they only drain resources. What will solve the problem and what does solve the problem and has been shown to solve the problem with public education is parental and community involvement and good management. 
In Chicago, in my State of Illinois, innovative leadership and a `no excuses' attitude have reshaped the school system in only 2 years. Under the new leadership there, in a few years the Chicago public schools will be transformed into a first-rate school system across the board. The innovations, the reforms, the initiatives that are being undertaken there in Chicago will benefit all 425,000 students in the public system, not just a select few who might benefit from a voucher scheme or a tax plan such as this legislation suggests. 
Every mismanaged school needs to have the kind of leadership that, as we have demonstrated in Chicago, can work; not a draining off of what limited resources it already has. As for cost, private schools can charge less because only 17 percent of them--and you know the argument has been made that private schools can do it cheaper. But, again, look at the facts. Only 17 percent of the private schools provide special education, for example, and it costs at least twice as much to educate a disabled child. Remember that we have compulsory education in this country, so our public schools accept every child no matter the situation. No matter whether the children are disadvantaged or disabled or disruptive, the public schools accept them. If private schools were required by law to accept everyone, then it is likely that their costs would be commensurate with the costs in the private system. 
Many private schools also limit admission to students with good academic records, and they do not have to accept the disruptive students. These selective admissions policies mean that in practice what would really happen is that instead of parents choosing a school for their children, the school would choose the children that it is willing to accept. Again, this is turning things upside-down in terms of education policy, because for a school to be able to decide that some group of children or some children should not be admitted seems to me to set up the kind of dichotomy that I do not think, in this country, we want to see develop. Vouchers in this situation and the tax scheme that's suggested in S. 1133 would offer false hope to parents and children who could be denied admission to selective private schools. 
The Federal Government currently meets only about 6 percent of the costs of public education nationally. We do not even cover the costs of our mandated programs. The Presiding Officer and I, when we first came to the Senate, worked on the issue of unfunded mandates and recognized that, in many instances, the Congress will tell local governments to do something, will give directions, but we do not pay the costs of those directives. Education is yet 
another example, and public education particularly is another example of unfunded mandates flowing to the schools that we do not pay for because, again, on average we pay about 6 percent of the costs of education. 
For us now to further divert resources from an area where we are already not doing enough makes absolutely no sense, is counterproductive, and, it seems to me, flies in the face of our national obligation to see to it that no child is denied the opportunity to receive a quality education in America. But, transferring funds from public schools to private schools will not buy new textbooks for public school children nor will it encourage better teachers to go and work in the public schools. This tax scheme will not fix a single leaky roof or handle one set of management issues. It does nothing but, again, divert resources from a system already sorely in need and already grossly underfunded by our national contributions. 
Here in the District of Columbia, and in all cities, many businesses and apartment buildings--and this is by way of an analogy--businesses and apartment buildings hire private security guards to supplement their security because they do not believe that the local police will do an adequate job in protecting them. Does that mean, then, that we should skim money off of what we give to the police departments so we can make it easier for businesses to hire private security guards? Or that those funds would be better spent improving the quality of law enforcement by draining money off to private security forces? I do not think so. If anything, we have a responsibility as a community to use our public resources toward the public welfare and the public good. 
The reason we have compulsory education in this country is so that every child can receive a quality education. If our public schools are not all meeting that challenge, then it is our responsibility to fix them. It is our responsibility to engage in a partnership with the States and local governments, so that education can be the priority for our country that it must be. Spending taxpayers' dollars on private schools, again, is not going to fix a single public school. 
One of the more troubling aspects of the legislation is the underlying premise that the public schools cannot succeed, that we just have to write them off. This bill says to America's public schoolteachers and principals and families with children in the schools, `You have failed.' It starts a process of diverting resources from public schools to private schools, and it seems to me that is absolutely the wrong message. 
There is, however, good news from public education. I think we need to talk about that a little bit. Again, relating to some of the innovations going on in Illinois, there is a consortium of some 20 school districts in the Chicago area. It is called the First in the World Consortium. They lived up to their name because in the international math and science tests of which I spoke earlier, this group of schools scored first in the world. They were all public school students and they scored first in math and science--the public school system, and they received the best results in the world in these areas. 
The results of these tests prove that America's public schools can produce the best and the brightest students in the world if only they have the support, the resources and the tools with which to do the job. What does the First in the World Consortium have that too many of our schools lack? It is not the kids. It is not the makeup of the students. Our children are as capable of performance as children anywhere else in the world, whether they come from rich families or from poor families. We have some of the brightest students in the world, who only need the opportunity to learn. The difference, however, is what support we as a community provide for those children. The schools that comprise the First in the World Consortium have some of the best facilities in this country. They have small classes. They have modern technology. They have supportive communities. And they have engaged and involved parents and teachers. 
We all, I think, have a responsibility to ensure that every American child will have access to the same kind of quality education that is made available in the public schools at the First in the World Consortium. The tax changes envisioned in this legislation will not accomplish that goal. The bill will not result, again, in the improvement of a single public school. The amendment which I hope to talk about suggests that we have to undertake a partnership between the State and local and National Governments to provide the kind of resources for public education that made our country the strongest in the world and will keep it the strongest in the world for the 21st Century. 
This conversation is going to go on for a couple of days. I would like to leave you with an analogy which I think is absolutely appropriate when we talk about how we are going to address the challenge of education for the 21st Century. 
There have been some arguments that it is not the Federal Government's job; that, indeed, it should be left to the locals to address education, and it is their job, it is their responsibility to see to it that the schools in a local community function well and provide quality education. I would point out to the Presiding Officer and to anyone else listening that that analogy fails altogether to recognize our national interest and our interest as a community of Americans in seeing to it that all children, whether they live in Chicago or California or Detroit or in Florida or in Georgia or in Alabama--that all children in this country receive the best possible education that we can give them. It is particularly important in this information age, given the technological revolution, because the command of and the ability to manipulate and use information will be more important in the workforce of the future than it is today. If we do not educate our children, we will, as a country, see a lessening in the ability of our national workforce to be productive in these global markets. 
So, to use an analogy, when it comes to talking about what is our interest, why should the Senator from Illinois care about education for a child from North Dakota or why should the Senator from Illinois care about the education of a child in Alabama, the reason I care is I love my country and I care about the ability of my country to have a workforce that can function in this global economy. Just as in the 1950s it was seen as in our national interest to bring our country together, this debate holds the same promise. This debate will either turn on a vision of America that says we are all connected to each other, we all have a responsibility to each other, or it will turn on a vision of America that says, `I've got mine; you get yours. In your State, in your city, education is your problem.' 
I suggest the time for the finger-pointing on education has to stop. We have to form a partnership that will provide our schools with the resources that we will need to educate our children--all of them. Again, to use the analogy from the 1950s, President Eisenhower saw the value in providing our country with an interstate highway system. He brought America together by providing a system whereby the National Government would contribute to the construction and the development of roads all across this country. That interstate highway system brought us together as a nation and served our national interests in transportation. 
The way that we are funding education currently would be the equivalent of saying to each and every community in America--which, of course, we are saying to each and every community in America--you go find the money from your local property tax base to provide for your schools. And if you don't have the money in your local property taxes for your schools, it will just be too bad. To use the road analogy again, it's like saying in those communities that have a limited property tax base and in poor communities, they will have shoddy roads if any roads at all. The middle-class communities with moderate means will have kind of a hodgepodge and a mix of decent roads and kind-of-decent roads; and the wealthy communities will have the greatest roads in the world. But when you put it all together, you have not served 
transportation from one end of this country to the other. You have left the issue of transportation up to the resources of the specific and discrete communities and, more to the point, the property tax base that that community can resort to. That is how we fund education in this country. By relying on the local property tax base, we depend entirely on the accident of geography and demographics whether or not a child's school will be adequate to provide a quality education. 
So I say to my colleagues that, as we look at this issue, let's find common ground, let's stop pointing fingers, and, as much the point, let's not continue to allow the kind of savage inequalities that exist among communities based on wealth to determine the future of our country in this 21st century global economy. If a community does not have the property tax resources to provide for educational opportunity, then that community ought to be supported in its efforts to educate its children by the State and by the National Government. We all have a role to play. We all have a contribution to make. 
Again, finger pointing only hurts the children. I am going to, at this point, thank the Chair and yield the floor. I just say I look forward very much to continuing this debate in the upcoming days. I think it is one of the most important debates that we can take up as a Senate. I think the future of our country, indeed our national security, hangs on our ability to address in a sensible and workable and comprehensive way, the challenge of public education for the 21st Century. 
I yield the floor.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is my honor today to recognize and celebrate the 86th anniversary of the birth of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America (Girl Scouts of the USA). 
Eighty six years ago, Juliette Gordon Low founded Girl Scouts of the USA with 18 members in her Savannah, Georgia living room. Today, there are over 2.6 million girl members, and a loyal corps of over 800,000 adult volunteers. This is Girl Scouting's third highest membership in 20 years. In my home state of Illinois, there are almost 200,000 Girl Scouts and volunteers. These numbers serve as strong evidence that the principles of honesty, service, community and self development upon which Ms. Low founded Girl Scouts of the USA 86 years ago are still relevant and meaningful to girls of all ages across our nation. 
Girl Scouts still sell cookies, earn merit badges and go camping, but they also participate in sports, learn science and computer technology, and engage in activities that promote lasting friendships, diversity, cultural appreciation, personal improvement, and career development. Additionally, Girl Scouts participate in many meaningful community service projects that teach participants about the society in which they live, and address challenging issues such as illiteracy and school violence. 
Most important, over the last 86 years, Girl Scouts of the USA has provided girls with the skills, understanding, and confidence to become successful women and citizens of our nation and the world. It is my distinct pleasure to acknowledge the incredible success that Girl Scouts of the USA has enjoyed over the last 86 years, and to wish them the best of luck as they prepare for the future.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, this is an amendment authorizing $45 million annually across the country for railway crossing improvements that are necessary in high-speed rail corridors across the country. High-speed rail, of course, is the future of passenger rail in America, and it holds great promise for our country. 
One high-speed rail network is under development right now in the Midwest that will connect Chicago with St. Louis, Milwaukee, Detroit, and possibly even Minneapolis and Cincinnati. There are a number of corridors under development throughout the country--in Florida, in California, the Pacific Northwest, North Carolina, and in New York. There are proposed high-speed rail corridors in Ohio, Georgia, and other States as well. 
Perhaps the greatest challenge impeding the development of high-speed rail are problems and issues at rail crossings. When trains begin to exceed speeds of 110 or 125 miles an hour, grade crossings that might otherwise be safe are made unsafe. The possibility for a tragedy increases incrementally. 
We had a terrible tragedy a couple of years ago outside of Chicago. A school bus was struck by a train in Fox River Grove, Illinois, and seven children died. It was a terrible tragedy. That is the type of accident that we ought to do everything we possibly can do to prevent. It should never have happened. Again, with trains going at speeds of 110 and 125 miles an hour, the likelihood of a tragedy like this happening, unfortunately, increases incrementally. 
This amendment will authorize an additional $45 million annually for the improvement of railroad highway crossings on high-speed rail corridors. The funds will not come out of any other program. They will not come out of any one's highway or transit program. It is simply an authorization of additional funds for improving safety at rail crossings. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I think that is right. 
Again, as the ranking member is aware, I talked about how Illinois is a hub State for transportation generally. We are a hub State for rail have among the highest numbers of rail crossings in the country. So we have so much more of this. We have so many more rail crossings that in the development of the high-speed rail--which everyone wants to see because it is the future of rail transportation and rail transit in the country--I think we need not be unmindful. We need to be mindful, and focus in on safety. 
I am grateful to the leaders on this legislation for their consideration of this matter.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I thank the leaders of the Environment and Public Works Committee--Chairman Chafee, Senator Baucus, and Senator Warner--for working with us on this amendment, and I want to thank my colleague from Colorado, Mr. Campbell, for offering this amendment with me. 
Our amendment will help address concerns that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been actively lobbying state legislatures to enact state laws that are not consistent with any other federal mandate or incentive program. It has come to our attention, for example, that NHTSA has engaged in an active lobbying campaign to urge states to enact laws mandating that motorcycle riders wear helmets. 
Two years ago, during consideration of the National Highway System bill, Congress voted to repeal a section of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act that sanctioned States without mandatory motorcycle helmet laws. At that time, Congress determined that the issue of motorcycle safety was best left in the hands of State governments, and that the decision about whether or not to enact mandatory helmet laws was best left to State lawmakers. 
Since that time, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has actively engaged in a lobbying campaign to try to persuade State legislators to enact mandatory motorcycle helmet laws. According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, they sent letters, made phone calls, showed up at State hearings on motorcycle helmet laws and acted in a variety of ways to encourage States to enact mandatory helmet laws. Sometimes they have been invited to offer their technical expertise, and sometimes they have simply shown up to try to persuade State legislators to require motorcycle riders to wear helmets. 
NHTSA recently entered into a $149,000 contract to produce a media package designed to encourage States to enact mandatory helmet laws. This contract includes the production of a video and other promotional materials. I would like to quote from the description of the contract: 
The contractor shall produce a media package that includes a 12 to 15 minute video presentation and complementary `white paper' that presents the injury prevention and economic benefits of enacting mandatory motorcycle helmet laws for all riders. . . . While the primary audience will be state legislators, the information contained in the video and accompanying `white paper' can also be used by Federal, state, and local safety officials, and injury prevention groups who are working to replace existing, but ineffective, helmet laws with stronger mandatory helmet use legislation. This information will also be used to provide technical assistance in order to defeat repeal efforts of existing laws. 
Mr. President, I know that NHTSA engages in lobbying efforts on a number of safety issues and encourages States to enact laws and implement policies relating to a variety of highway safety issues. I do not oppose these activities, and our amendment does not prevent NHTSA from continuing to work with States to improve highway safety. 
With regard to motorcycle safety, however, NHTSA would do better by the American public if they were to encourage States to implement rider education and awareness programs, rather than concentrating their energy on encouraging States to enact mandatory motorcycle helmet laws. 
The evidence suggests that it is those States with the most comprehensive rider education programs that have the lowest accident and fatality rates--not the States with the toughest mandatory helmet laws. 
In 44 States, motorcycle riders pay for rider education programs. Since 1980, both motorcycle accidents and motorcycle fatalities have fallen from an all time high of 5,097 fatalities and 177,160 accidents to 2,221 fatalities and 73,432 accidents. Through safety training, over 15 years, motorcyclists reduced accidents by 58 percent and fatalities by 56 percent. 
The job of NHTSA should be to encourage States to strengthen their motorcycle rider education programs--not to encourage States to restrict the freedoms of motorcycle riders by forcing them to wear helmets. 
I would like to quote briefly from a letter from the director of NHTSA, Dr. Ricardo Martinez, to a State legislator, discussing this issue. I believe this letter succinctly illustrates NHTSA's attitude toward motorcyclists. Dr. Martinez wrote in this letter dated June 17, 1997, `Like other preventable diseases, motorcycle riders can be vaccinated to prevent most head injuries by simply wearing a helmet.' 
Mr. President, motorcyclists are not diseased, and they should not be treated as though they are. The issue is not whether motorcycle riders ought to wear helmets. Of course they should. 
The question, however, is what is the appropriate Federal role in improving motorcycle safety? The question is whether the Federal government should mandate the use of motorcycle helmets, and whether the Federal government should actively try to persuade State governments to mandate the use of motorcycle helmets. 
Congress answered the first question two years ago when we repealed the penalties on States that did not have mandatory motorcycle helmet laws. 
Our amendment addresses the second question, and will redirect NHTSA's interest in improving motorcycle safety toward the promotion of rider education programs, and away from the misguided promotion of mandatory helmet laws. 
I again thank the leadership of the Environment and Public Works Committee and Senator Campbell, who has been a leader in this issue. We worked together two years ago, along with a number of other senators, to repeal the motorcycle helmet mandate. He is here now, and I know he would like to comment on the intent of this amendment.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, my colleague from Colorado just made an important point. We would encourage NHTSA to work with state governments to improve motorcycle safety and education programs, to work with them on accident prevention, on rider education, and on driver awareness campaigns. Our amendment is simply designed to ensure that NHTSA's efforts on behalf of motorcycle safety are no longer one-sided, and are no longer in conflict with the stated intent of Congress, which was to leave the decision of whether to enact mandatory motorcycle helmet laws entirely to state legislatures.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, several months ago, during the debate on the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, some of my colleagues called upon Congress to end its commitment to ethanol. 
These lawmakers drew their daggers in professed horror, charging that federal support for ethanol was some sort of `deficit buster,' or a conspiracy of `corporate welfare.' 
While I know that in recent years, this mantra has become popular and convenient for some, it falls far short of the facts in this instance. 
Ethanol, as my colleagues are aware, is an alcohol-based motor fuel manufactured from corn. Over fifty facilities produce ethanol in more than twenty different states. By the year 2005, 640 million bushels of corn will be used to produce 1.6 billion gallons of ethanol. 
Ethanol is good for the environment. Ethanol burns more cleanly than gasoline, and, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, diminishes dangerous fossil-based fumes, like carbon monoxide and sulfur, that choke the air of our congested urban areas. 
Tankers will not spill ethanol into our oceans, killing wildlife. National parks and refuges will not be target for exploratory drilling. When ethanol supplies run low, you simply grow more corn. 
Ethanol strengthens our national security. Ethanol flows not from oil wells in the Middle East, but from grain elevators in the Middle West, using American farmers, and creating American jobs. With each acre of corn, ten barrels of foreign oil are displaced--up to 70,000 barrels each day. 
And for farmers, ethanol creates value-added markets, creating new jobs and boosting rural economic development. According to a recent study conducted by Northwestern University, the 1997 demand for ethanol is expected to create 195,000 new jobs nationwide. 
Ethanol is the fuel of the future--and the future is here. Illinois drivers consumer almost five billion gallons of gasoline, one-third of which is blended with ethanol. Chicago automotive plants are assembling a new Ford Taurus that runs on 85 percent ethanol. More and more gas stations are offering ethanol as a choice at the pump. 
Isn't it worth cultivating an industry that improves the environment and promotes energy independence? Isn't it the responsibility of Congress to foster an economic climate that creates jobs and strengthens domestic industry? Don't we have a commitment to rural America, and a responsibility for its economic future? 
Mr. President, I think the answer to these questions is a resounding yes, and that's why I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. I commend Senator Santorum and Senator Specter for their work on this and, of course, the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator D'Amato, and the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, for their work on this issue in that committee. 
This amendment will improve the job access grants that are contained in the bill, in the underlying legislation. 
Last September, when the Banking Committee--of which I am a member--considered the mass transit component of ISTEA reauthorization, I was successful in adding to the bill a $600 million grant program to help welfare recipients and low-income individuals to get to work. I thank again the Chairman, Senator D'Amato, as well as Senator Sarbanes and the others who helped make that possible. 
The amendment that my colleagues from Pennsylvania and I are offering today expands and improves the job access provisions in the Banking Committee's bill. The amendment more than doubles the amount of funding available for the program--from $100 million per year to $250 million per year. 
The amendment increases from $100 million to $150 million the amount available every year for access to jobs grants--monies designed to address the fact that, in too many cases, in both urban and rural areas, welfare recipients and low-income individuals are isolated from the jobs they want and need. 
The amendment adds an additional $100 million per year for a new reverse commute program, designed to provide seed money to local communities to shuttle employees who live in central cities, or in outlying rural areas, into jobs located in the suburbs. 
Two-thirds of all new jobs are being created in the suburbs. Many suburban communities report severe labor shortages because they cannot find enough workers looking for entry-level jobs. Public transportation systems, however, are often not designed to move people from either inner cities or rural areas to job opportunities in the suburbs. This amendment will help communities implement new transit systems designed to transport people of all income levels from their homes in cities and rural areas to jobs in rapidly-growing suburban communities. 
Mr. President, I would like to talk for a moment about the access to jobs portion of this amendment. I am very pleased that I have been able to work with my colleagues from Pennsylvania, as well as with the leadership of the committee, to increase the amount of funding available for that program. 
Last year, Congress enacted legislation to move people from welfare to work, the welfare-to-work legislation that was so much a point of discussion a year ago. The bill imposed time limits and other restrictions that will result in the termination of benefits for an estimated two million people by the year 2002. One of the greatest obstacles many of these current welfare recipients face in getting jobs is literally getting to the jobs. Welfare recipients and low-income individuals often live, almost by definition, in impoverished communities devoid of job opportunities. I pointed out that in a single census tract near the public housing developments in Chicago, there is less than 1 percent, according to the census, less than 1 percent employment in that entire census tract. Clearly, people have to get to where the jobs are. Mr. President, 94 percent of welfare recipients do not have cars. Low-wage earners often do not have cars. They are dependent on public transportation to get to areas with jobs. If the public transit is inadequate, the jobs become inaccessible. People cannot move from welfare to work if the people on welfare can't get to the work. 
In many communities with high concentrations of welfare recipients and low-wage earners, new jobs are practically non-existent. Three-quarters of welfare recipients live in central cities or rural areas, and as I already noted, two-thirds of all new jobs are created in suburbs. So clearly we have to resolve this disconnect to allow people to get from welfare to work, and this program goes a long way in that direction. 
In Cleveland, a study found that inner city residents can only reach between eight and 15 percent of job openings in a reasonable time using public transportation. Even if central city residents were willing to commute for two hours and 40 minutes every day, they would still have access to less than half of the entry-level jobs in the Cleveland area. A separate study of 43 large metropolitan areas revealed that communities with the longest job commute times had the highest rates of unemployment. So the ability to have access to employment is directly correlated with the ability of people to hold employment. 
In Boston, there are public transit stations within one-half mile of 99 percent of the city's welfare recipients. Only 43 percent of employers, however, are within one-half mile of transit lines. 
Studies of Baltimore and Atlanta have demonstrated the same trend. While the jobs are in the suburbs, the people looking for the jobs are not. 
In rural areas, the same problems exist. The Community Transportation Association of America has found that 40 percent of all rural counties have no public transportation whatsoever. When transit is present, it often does not operate at night or on weekends--times when many low-wage or entry-level jobs are performed. 
By filling the gaps in transit services, we can give people the chance to get to the jobs they seek. In Chicago, an innovative Suburban Job Links program is doing just that. Buses carry workers from the Pilsen neighborhood on the near southwest side of the City to their jobs at Avon Products in north-suburban Morton Grove. Hundreds of city residents are carried on buses and vans to places like a UPS facility in southwest-suburban Hodgkins. 
The amendment we are offering today will help to broaden this program and help other communities replicate its success and test new approaches to solving this problem. The amendment also preserves the important funding ratio between urban, small urban, and rural areas. Sixty percent of funds will be awarded to projects in large cities, 20 percent to projects in small cities, and 20 percent to projects in rural areas. 
Again, I thank my colleagues from Pennsylvania and the leadership of the Banking Committee for their work on this important initiative. 
Mr. President, I would like at this point to take advantage of the time to speak to the minimum allocation amendment. I do not know whether or not there is action to be taken on this amendment?

I commend the Senator from New York for his work on the minimum allocation issue because, of course, maintaining the balance of which he speaks is a very, very important thing to this entire bill. So I will defer, without losing my right to the floor, until the Senate has acted on this amendment. I defer and yield for that purpose.

I would like at the outset to congratulate the Senator from New York for his work on this minimum allocation issue because it really goes to the heart of this legislation and it is a very, very important issue. 
But I will take the time at this point to speak to the proposal that we have seen in the hopes that the Senator from New York is as successful as he has been on these issues overall and can get this matter resolved through the legislative compromise.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank my colleague for his gracious remarks. He is exactly right. 
We have an expression at home that says, `Just outside of Chicago there's a place called `Illinois.' Much of my State is rural. And, of course, I share the concern that we provide for transit and transportation in rural areas as well as the urban ones. 
I am delighted that an agreement has been reached in this regard that will maintain the balance for transit and highway funding in this legislation. That balance, I think, represents the best national interests, the interests in getting people moved from place to place, getting people to where the jobs are and making certain that we do not unduly jeopardize commerce, jeopardize the environment, jeopardize our ability to provide for the movement of large numbers of people by our disrupting of the formula between mass transit and highway funding in this ISTEA legislation. 
So, again, I commend my colleague and commend the members of the committee who have worked on this issue. I am very, very pleased that we have worked this out, because in its previous incarnation, the minimum allocation proposal would have been disastrous for mass transportation and I think would have mitigated against the national interest in moving people from place to place and protecting the environment and in aiding commercial activity in the country. If it has been resolved in ways as has been suggested here this afternoon, then I think that is the best of all possible worlds. 
Mr. President, Rudolf Julius Emmanuel Clausius was a 19th century German physicist famous for saying, `The entropy of the universe tends to a maximum.' What he meant was, that if left to its own designs, the universe will continue to expand and progress away from its origin of a singular, focused point, toward a state of increasing disorder. 
If Mr. Clausius were alive and here today, he might well say, `The entropy of the Senate tends to a maximum.' We sometimes have an uncanny ability to take a perfectly good Federal program that targets a national need and dilute it to the point where it is barely recognizable as a program designed to address a specific purpose. The amendment before us today--the amendment to establish a so-called `minimum allocation' for mass transit funds--would do exactly that. It would increase the entropy of the transit program to the point where the program would no longer serve its intended purpose. 
This amendment represents a digression from the path we were on last week. Last week was a good week for those of us who support investing in our Nation's infrastructure. First, an agreement was reached providing an additional $25.8 billion for highway improvements and construction. Second, an agreement was reached to distribute those funds in a more equitable manner than the rest of the highway funds being allocated under the ISTEA reauthorization bill. Third, an agreement was reached providing an additional $5 billion in mass transit funding, increasing from $36 billion to $41 billion the amount of funding transit will receive over the next 6 years. 
I am a builder by inclination. I believe one of the most economically productive activities in which the Federal Government can and should engage is infrastructure investment. Those of us who share that view welcomed last week's developments. 
This week, the Senate appears to have digressed. The amendment we are considering today would take the heart out of the Federal transit program--a program upon which millions of commuters rely every single day to get to work, a program that relieves congestion in cities and suburbs, a program that provides mobility for millions of elderly Americans who can no longer safely drive, a program that allows millions of disabled Americans, to get to work, to access medical care, grocery stores, and other essential services, a program that improves the quality of the air we breathe, a program that boosts economic activity in our urban centers, a program that is vital to our cities, critical to our suburban and rural communities, and that ought to be a priority as we formulate our national, intermodal surface transportation policy. 
We are now considering an amendment which forgets all that, which forgets about the importance of transit to commuters, to the elderly and disabled, to our environment, and to our economy. It is an amendment that forgoes national policy in favor of parochial pork. It is an amendment that turns a program targeted toward specific needs into a diluted formula allocation of funds to states without regard to needs of communities. It is a cynical 
ploy by States without mass transit to grab money from States that do. The so-called `minimum allocation' for transit amendment will indeed marginalize our national interest in providing efficient transportation for millions of Americans. 
Mr. President, mass transit is a critical part of our national intermodal transportation system. People depend on transit to get to work. More than half of all transit trips are for work purposes. Transit helps the environment. Without public transit there would be 5 million more cars on the roads and 27,000 more lane miles of roads. The degradation of the air from such a massive infusion of pollution is incalculable. Transit is a great economic investment. The net economic return on public expenditures for public transportation is four or five to one. When mass transit improvements are made, land values go up, commercial development increases, and jobs are created. Without transit, congestion alone would cost the private sector economy $15 billion annually. 
Mass transit is particularly important to States like Illinois. Chicago is the fifth-most congested area in the country. Congestion and bottlenecks sap the region's economic productivity by $2.8 billion every year. Without transit, congestion in Chicago would likely be unbearable, and without continued investments in the area's aging transit systems, the cost to the local and regional economy will grow. 
Three-fourths of the Chicago Transit Authority's elevated structures--used by 400,000 passengers every single day--are more than 80 years old. METRA, which carries 270,000 riders a day into and out of the city, uses 300 bridges that are at least 80 years old, and 52 of those are listed in `critical' condition. The Regional Transportation Authority of Northeastern Illinois--which carries 1.8 million riders every single workday--estimates it needs $3 billion over the next 5 years just to bring Chicago-area transit systems up to `a state of good repair' and to control operating costs. 
The Chicago Transit Authority, which operates the Nation's second largest public transportation system, needs $336 million in Federal funds to rehabilitate the Douglas branch of the Blue Line, which serves Chicago's near west side. The line was originally opened for service more than 100 years ago. Every weekday, more than 13,000 riders use the line, which feeds right into the heart of downtown Chicago and into west-side manufacturing districts. Shutting down this line because funds are not available to repair it would be a disaster for the area. 
The CTA also seeks funds to expand the capacity of the Ravenswood line. In order to run longer trains on the tracks, the station platforms will have to be lengthened and improvements made to various parts of the track system. This project will cost several hundred million dollars. 
METRA--which is the country's second largest commuter rail system and which serves an area as large as the State of Connecticut, with a population base of over 7.5 million people--seeks more than $300 million to expand capacity. Recent studies indicate that the Chicago area will experience a 25 percent population growth by 2020, and employment will grow by 37 percent over the same period. Expanded and improved transit service will be essential if the region's transportation system is to absorb that level of growth. 
In southern Illinois, outside of St. Louis, Federal funds are needed to continue extending the new MetroLink system all the way to the new Mid-America Airport. 
The current program structure is designed to help meet these needs. It targets resources based on need. Through the transit formula programs, Federal funding ensures the continued maintenance, operation, and improvement of our Nation's existing transit systems. Through the discretionary capital programs, Federal funding assists in the development and expansion of new transit systems, whether bus or rail, whether urban or rural. 
The current program is a strong Federal-local partnership. Funds are allocated directly to local authorities, or to state authorities based on local needs, using factors such as population, transit ridership, and the size of existing transit systems. 
The so-called `minimum allocation' amendment would destroy that program structure. It would result in resources not being targeted toward needs, decrease the cost-efficiency of building and operating mass transit systems, and cripple the ability of Federal funds to leverage State and local resources. 
The amendment distorts the intent and direction of the Federal transit program by basing transit funding on gasoline consumption. By so doing, the amendment creates an illogical and perverse dynamic: a state that invested in transit and used Federal transit funds to improve service would, in future years, see its share of transit funds decline, because transit riders do not consume gasoline. There is no precedent for such an impossible incentive system--a system that withholds Federal funds from States that spend them most effectively. 
I want to make sure that every member of the Senate understands the irrational nature of this amendment. Consider what would happen in the State of North Carolina. I know that the Raleigh-Durham area seeks funding to build a new commuter rail system. The minimum allocation amendment would make their task harder for two reasons. First, it would reduce the amount of Federal funding available to build new transit systems, making it less likely that the Raleigh-Durham area would receive enough federal assistance to build the system on a cost-effective schedule. Second, if the system were to be built, the amount of Federal funding the Raleigh-Durham transit agency would receive to support the system would slowly decline over time. That is because the commuter rail system would take cars off the road. If it worked, as most transit systems do, it would reduce gasoline consumption in the area. Since transit funding would be based on gasoline consumption, North Carolina would receive less and less transit funding, even as the Raleigh-Durham system grew older and required more capital investments to keep it running. Eventually, the system would deteriorate, people would stop riding the trains, and the considerable capital investments made by the taxpayers to set up the system would go to waste. 
That is the incentive system this amendment establishes. It makes absolutely no sense. The fact is, States like Illinois receive a proportionally large share of mass transit funding today because we have a proportionally large share of mass transit riders. People take almost 540 million trips every year on Chicago-area transit systems alone. 
Mr. President, supporters of the minimum allocation amendment seem to have lost sight of the national objective and purpose of the transit program. It is not a program designed to spread money around to every State in equal proportion. It is designed to address real needs that affect our entire nation. 
I do not doubt claims that rural areas have tremendous transit needs. In fact, it is a disturbing fact that 40 percent of all rural counties in America have absolutely no public transit whatsoever. Where transit does exist in rural areas, it often does not operate on weekends or late into the night--times when many low-income individuals count on transit to get to jobs. Rural areas do have transit needs, and I support increases in the transit program in order to help expand access to public transportation in rural areas. Destroying the transit program in order to funnel more money to rural areas, however, is not the way to achieve those objectives. 
Supporters of the minimum allocation amendment complain that drivers in their States pay taxes on the gasoline they consume, that those revenues are deposited into the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund, and that their State does not receive its fair share of those revenues. 
The reason we have a national government, Mr. President, is `to form a more perfect Union.' To that end, we have established a variety of programs designed to address national needs. The transit program is one of those programs. Our Nation's metropolitan areas rely on transit systems. They could not exist without them. 
Our cities are among the Nation's most important assets. Visitors to and residents of our urban centers enjoy access to unlimited entertainment, myriad cultural activities, and unrivaled educational and economic opportunities. And 26 million leisure travelers visit Chicago each year in order to sample the city's 7,000 restaurants, 100 theaters, and 250 museums and art galleries; to stroll in its 552 parks; and to view some of the world's most unusual and interesting architecture. Cities like Chicago play a crucial role in the life of the Nation, adding immensely to its wealth and its quality of life. 
Our major cities would not be as enjoyable, livable, and attractive as they are in the absence of their mass transit systems. Without transit, congestion in Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco, Baltimore, and Cleveland would bring those cities to a halt. The air quality in Manhattan would deteriorate rapidly. Our cities need viable transit systems, and this is precisely why we have a national transit program. It fulfills a critical need and repays the investment many times over. 
There are a lot of Federal programs that are designed to meet national needs and which do not benefit my state of Illinois at all, if you only look at them through the limited prism of only where the dollars are actually spent. Illinois receives almost no funding under the Federal lands highway program, for example, even though Illinois residents pay their fair share of gas taxes into the Highway Trust Fund, from which monies are drawn to pay for the Federal lands highway program. That is because Illinois has almost no Federal lands. Illinois receives almost no funding from the Bureau of Land Management, because Illinois has no lands under its control. Illinois receives almost no funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Bureau of Reclamation, either--because the needs those programs are designed to address are not found in Illinois. 
Mr. President, those are the consequences of having a national government. That is the price we pay for having `a more perfect Union.' We all contribute to national goals and objectives, even if those priorities are not found in our own backyards. If the objective of a national government were to return Federal tax revenues to their States of origin, Illinois would probably not do too badly. But that is not the purpose of our national government. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will vote against this destructive amendment. The transit program is not a highway program. Highway programs have long been battlegrounds for convoluted formulas that allocate funds to political power-centers. Witness this year's shift of Federal highway funds from the northeast to the south--a reflection of the shift in power in the Senate. 
The transit program is different. It is not a Federal-State program. It is a Federal-local partnership. It has never been a mere political battleground for more funds. The program has been carefully designed to target needs, and it works. Nothing would destroy the transit program more quickly than the enactment of this amendment. 
I urge every one of my colleagues to consider the national policy implications of their vote, prove the German physicist Mr. Clausius wrong, and vote against this bad idea. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, thank you. I rise in strong opposition to the pending amendment that would dismantle the Department of Transportation's affirmative action programs and roll back 15 years of gains that have been made by minority and women contractors. 
The Department of Transportation's DBE program, Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program, ensures that small women- and minority-owned companies have the opportunity to participate in the Federal aid highway program. It does not guarantee anything; it simply allows an opportunity to compete. It levels the playing field, giving small and women-owned businesses and minority-owned businesses an equal opportunity to submit winning bids. The DBE program is fair; it is necessary, and it works. 
This program--and let me suggest another way to look at this issue, Mr. President--the DBE program is no more and no less than a structural response to a structural distortion of our society, a distortion that is caused by 200 years of slavery and segregation and, frankly, the status of women and an age-old tradition that set women apart as second-class citizens as well. It responds to the unfortunate but obvious fact that our society was constructed on the traditional station of women and minorities. 
Women do not earn 75 percent of the earnings of men who have the same jobs because they are 25 percent less competent or because they pay 25 percent less for food. African Americans are not proportionally poorer, sicker, more imprisoned, or less educated because of accident but, again, because of those distortions created in today's society by those institutional structures that were crafted centuries and decades ago. 
The DBE program addresses these underlying realities. It helps to weave thousands of small businesses into the fabric of our economy and our society. It creates for us a stronger Nation. A society that taps the talent of 100 percent of its people is a stronger society because it can draw on a broader pool of talent. A community that gives all of its members a chance to contribute to the maximum extent of their abilities is a stronger community because it benefits from a broader range of contributions. 
America is never so magnificent as when she reflects her nobler tradition. Justice and equality, opportunity based on merit and capacity--these are among some of the defining values of our country, and these values are reflected in this DBE program. 
The debate over the DBE program has so far been characterized by distortion of the structure and the results of the program. I have heard more than a few in the debate this afternoon. The facts are, it is a fair program that operates within the bounds of the Constitution. It has worked well, and it has created opportunities for thousands of minority- and women-owned businesses. 
I have heard a lot of conversation about the constitutionality. I point out, Mr. President, if you read the Constitution of the United States--and here is a copy. I took Senator Byrd's advice and I carry mine around with me. If you read article I, it is very clear that Americans of African descent were not citizens of this great country when the Constitution was written. Similarly, women were not voters of this country when this Constitution was written. Americans of African descent did not receive the rights of citizenship until the passage of the 14th and 15th amendments in 1868, and women were not enfranchised to vote in this country until this century, until 1920, with the passage of the 19th amendment. 
But ours is a living Constitution. And it is a Constitution that changes over time to reflect the realities of the community as a whole, to keep the core values as it adjusts to changes in the makeup and composition and demographics of the country. 
This Constitution has lived so long precisely because it responds to distortions in our society, precisely because it adapts itself to the realities of the time, and because it continues to reflect those core values that bring us together and make us all Americans. And the fact of the matter is that this legislation is constitutional, as has been discussed on this floor. 
In 1982, Mr. President, Congress established a national goal for at least 10 percent of Federal highway and transit project funds to be expended with small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged people. 
In 1987, Congress extended this initiative to include women-owned businesses. And in 1991, the program was first included in ISTEA, which is, of course, the legislation that is sought to be amended today. President Reagan signed the 1982 and 1987 measures into law; and President Bush signed the 1991 legislation, again, to bring women, to bring minorities into the economic mainstream of our country. 
I will make one other point. This is another digression. But I have listened to the debate today. And even on the screen when this gets broadcast on C-SPAN, it says, `Amendment re minorities.' This legislation is not just about minorities, Mr. President. It is about women as well. And we need to make certain that every person who listens to this debate understands that by casting it just in terms of minorities, it changes the focus of the debate, it becomes a subterfuge for a set of buzzwords that, frankly, in my opinion, do not reflect well on this Senate and on this debate. 
Under the Federal DBE program, State and local governments work to achieve goals they set for themselves based on the ability of qualified disadvantaged businesses in their areas, without quotas, without set-asides, and without penalty if they fail to meet their goals after good-faith efforts. 
In 1996, most States set 10 percent goals for themselves. Some States set higher goals, up to 14 and 16 percent. Only three States failed altogether to achieve their DBE goals in 1996. And only two States failed to reach 10 percent. Most States exceeded their DBE goals, in some cases by large margins. 
In my home State of Illinois, which set a 10 percent goal for itself in 1996, 15 percent of its highway construction funds were awarded to DBEs. Again, you are talking all minorities, you are talking all women. So you are really talking about a majority minority set-aside, if you think about it, because if you take women as a proportion of the population, you take minorities, all of them as a proportion of the population, what you really have is a majority of the population. Again, this legislation simply seeks to address a structural distortion in which that majority of the population participates at an unduly low and restrictive level of our economic activity. 
The DBE program is flexible in its work. In 1980, DBE participation in Federal highway construction was only 3.6 percent--again for the majority of the population of this country. Only 3.6 percent of the contracts given out by the Federal highway construction efforts were for DBEs. 
DBEs realized small gains over the next couple years when the Department of Transportation encouraged participation. Sharp gains were made, however, after Congress put the program into the law in 1982. DBE participation climbed to almost 17 percent in 1984, and it has hovered around 15 percent ever since. 
Now, who are the disadvantaged business enterprises? In 1996, DBEs again received slightly less than 15 percent of the Federal-aid highway construction money. Of that small slice, again, here we are--14.8 percent. This is everybody. These are women, minorities, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans --these are all the majority minority of the population that is described as `minorities' in the debate. They got all of 14 percent of Federal highway spending. 
Remember, we are all taxpayers now. Everybody is in the pool putting money in to make this happen, but 14 percent went out to women- and minority-owned businesses in 1996. And 85 percent went to the traditional white male business owners. 
Now that is just the reality. This is not about taking anything away from anybody. But it has to be said, and in very clear terms. Here is everybody else. This is the traditional economics. This is a reflection of an attempt to address a distortion in our society that comes out of the tradition of excluding women and minorities. The exclusions are no longer there, but inclusion has not yet happened. Integration has not yet happened. And that is why this debate is so vitally important. 
Let us take a look for a moment at the division within this 14.8 percent. African Americans are 14 percent of the 14 percent. Native Americans are 9 percent of the 14 percent. Asian Americans are 3 percent; Asian Pacific, 3 percent of the 14 percent; Asian Indian, 3 percent of the 14 percent. And we are not talking about the Sultan of Brunei either. He is not involved with any of this. We are talking about citizens of this great country. Hispanic Americans, 20 percent of this 14 percent. But look at this, Mr. President, 51 percent--51 percent--of this 14 percent are women-owned businesses. 
I ask the question why 50 percent of the conversation that has been going on this afternoon has not talked about the impacts on women that this repeal, if it is successful, will cause? 
So the DBE program then redresses gender discrimination as much as it does lingering racial imbalances. It provides economic opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs who would otherwise be shut out of the construction industry. I have received a number of letters from DBEs urging me to oppose this effort to repeal the program, letters from women and minorities who own and operate small business, small construction firms in all corners of Illinois. 
Their letters ask for the continued opportunity to compete. They drive home the point that the DBE program is not about taking contracts away from qualified male-owned businesses and handing them to unqualified female-owned firms. The program is not about denying contracts to Caucasian low-bidders in favor of higher bids that happen to have been submitted by Hispanic or African Americans or Asians or women. 
Instead, this program is about creating a climate of competition that brings everybody in. That is what all these business owners in Illinois want, the opportunity to compete. They want a level playing field in which to make the case that they can do the best job for the taxpayers for the least amount of money. They just want a fair chance. 
Listen to a letter from Sharon Arnold, who is president of SSACC, Inc., a certified women-owned disadvantaged business enterprise in Pontiac, IL:  
I know that without the [DBE] program I would lose the opportunity to compete. That is all this program does for me; it gives me the opportunity to compete. 
Ms. Arnold started her construction firm in 1986, the year before Congress added women to the DBE program. She writes that at the time `I was certain I had made the biggest mistake of my life. Contractors who I had been working with in the bidding process [as a former employee at another construction firm] had no interest [at all] in what I was trying to accomplish . . . Now, the reality is, they still don't care unless my . . . prices are the lowest. In this program competition is the name of the game.' 
Mr. President, that is the basic concept of the DBE program. Low bids still get the contracts. The program does not create special preferences for more expensive or less qualified bidders. It does not increase the cost of highway construction. 
The General Accounting Office has in fact examined this issue and concluded that the program results in less than a 1 percent increase in construction costs--1 percent, Mr. President--to begin to correct some structural distortions that everybody here in this room and certainly everybody in this country knows we have to be able to correct and resolve. 
All the DBE program does is open doors. Again, listen to Victor Wicks, President of Wicks Construction Services in southern Illinois. This is a man. 
The DBE program is an economic development program for both minority- and women-owned businesses. The program merely levels the playing field for minorities and women and affords them an equal opportunity to compete for federal construction dollars. . . . All we are asking for is a fair chance--an equal opportunity--a level playing field, for all Americans. 
That is what the DBE program provides for Mr. Wicks and the rest of the thousands of qualified disadvantaged businesses across this country. 
Mr. President, there has been some debate over whether the DBE program is constitutional in light of the Supreme Court decision in the case of Adarand Constructors v. Pena. Some of my colleagues have asserted that the Senate must `bring ISTEA into compliance with Adarand and the Constitution.' 
The fact is, the Senate need not do anything except extend current law in order to keep ISTEA in compliance with Adarand and the Constitution. The DBE program was not declared unconstitutional. On the contrary, the Supreme Court wrote the Federal Government must subject affirmative action programs to `strict scrutiny,' meaning that the programs must be `narrowly tailored' to meet a `compelling government interest.' 
The Court, in fact, explicitly stated that affirmative action is still a necessary function of our Government. And it wrote: 
The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and the government is not disqualified from acting in response to it. 
Mr. President, the `lingering effects of racial discrimination' of which the Court spoke are exactly the distortions in our society that I referenced earlier. Racism and sexism are indeed unhappy, but still very real, phenomena in our society. The DBE program is one of our responses to those lingering effects, and it works. 
Anyone who thinks there is not a `compelling government interest' to justify the DBE program need only to look at the States that do not have them in place for their State-funded highway construction programs. 
Data from these States provide side by side comparisons of two construction programs within each State--the Federal-aid highway program, which includes a DBE initiative; and those States' own highway programs for non-Federal-aid highways, which do not include DBE programs. 
I want you to consider the following examples from fiscal year 1996. 
In Arizona, DBEs received only 3.8 percent of State-funded highway construction dollars, State funded. They received 8.9 percent of the Federal-aid highway program. Again, DBE exists here; it does not exist there. 
In Arkansas, 2.9 percent of State dollars; 11.9 percent of Federal dollars. DBE program here; did not exist there. 
In Delaware, DBEs received less than 1 percent--less than 1 percent of State-funded highway construction dollars, while they received 12.7 percent of the Federal-aid highway funds in that State. 
The next one, the DBEs in Louisiana received only .4 percent --.4 percent--of funds under the State's highway construction program, which does not include a DBE initiative. They received 12.4 percent of funds awarded by the Federal program. 
In Michigan, another State without a DBE program, DBEs received only 1.4 percent of State highway construction funds. By contrast, they received 15 percent of Federal highway construction funds. 
I can go through Missouri, Nebraska, Oregon--Rhode Island, look at this. In Rhode Island we have the State program without a DBE program, and the State effort is zero percent for all the women and minorities put together. Zero percent of the State highway construction funds; 12 percent of the Federal highway construction funds where there was a DBE program. 
Now, this evidence, Mr. President, is incontrovertible. Where there are no DBE programs, women- and minority-owned small businesses are shut out of the highway construction. The Federal DBE program serves to redress the inequality and redress the unfortunate fact that all across the country women and minorities would not otherwise have access to construction contracts. 
Now, consider another example--the State of Michigan. In the second quarter of fiscal year 1989, the State of Michigan awarded 5 percent of its highway construction funds to small and minority-owned businesses, and 9.9 percent to small women-owned businesses. Again, I make the point that this debate has been focused on minorities, but it is women that are just as much at risk from this amendment as minorities. Near the end of that quarter, the State ended its DBE program. OK. Here we are right here. So 9.9 percent, 5 percent. Then the end of the program. Within 6 months, by the fourth quarter of that same fiscal year, minority disadvantaged businesses were completely shut out of the State's highway construction program. Less than 1 percent--.6 percent. They received zero contracts. By the first quarter of the following year, women were down to only 1.7 percent of the State's highway programs, down from 9.9 percent. 
So this was the experience. Look at this. Here we go. Just totally wiped out from the modest gains that had been made in that State. 
Well, Mr. President, that is exactly what would happen if we ended the Federal DBE program. Women- and minority-owned small construction companies would go out of business by the hundreds of thousands. 
I have to ask the question, is that really the result we want to have coming out of this debate? Is that really the legacy that the 105th Congress would like to impart on transportation policy--a legacy of no economic opportunity for thousands and thousands of small businesses? 
Nationwide, minorities represent 9 percent of all construction funds but receive only about 5 percent of all business receipts. That is overall--9 percent of all funds but 5 percent of all receipts. Women, who own one-third of all firms, get only 19 percent of business receipts. Let us not see 1998 go down as the year in which those opportunities to compete were further eroded. 
I urge all of my colleagues to consider the facts--the fact that the DBE Program is constitutional, that it is a program of economic opportunity, that it is a program of fairness, and that it is a program that works. I urge my colleagues to cast their votes for the ideals of opportunity and equality, which describe our Nation, which are described in this Constitution, in this living document. 
More to the point, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to move beyond the politics of division and zero-sum games. Those who oppose having this modest opportunity provided for women and minorities--this modest step to correct a structural distortion that has existed in our country since its founding, this tiny step to bring women and minorities into the economic mainstream and to integrate the business of our country--those who would oppose that are pushing buttons to divide Americans; to pit one against the other; to say this is a zero-sum game, you can't progress, you can't be integrated in this society without someone losing out. No one loses out in this program. No one loses out from opening up the doors of opportunity. 
Indeed, opportunity to compete, to have a level playing field, to move beyond race and gender, is what this country has got to be about. I urge my colleagues to reject this ill-considered amendment.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a concurrent resolution calling on railroad employers, employees, and retiree organizations to work together to provide for a secure retirement for widows and widowers of railroad employees. 
Currently, when a railroad employee retires, that retiree and his or her spouse receive 145 percent of the retiree's full retirement annuity. When that retiree dies, however, his or her spouse loses 100 percent of the retiree's annuity, leaving only a 45 percent survivor's benefit. The result can be that widows and widowers of railroad employees no longer have sufficient income on which to live. 
In Illinois alone, there are over 50,000 railroad retirees. Over three-quarters of these men and women are married. If nothing is done to correct these retirement inequities, the spouses of these retirees risk spending their final years in poverty. 
Many in the railroad industry acknowledge that these survivor benefits are inadequate. While railroad employees and employers pay substantially higher employment taxes than companies covered by Social Security, the higher taxes are not reflected in the level of benefits to which widows and widowers of retirees are entitled. 
This resolution calls on the railroad industry to forge a consensus to solve this problem. The resolution urges that rail labor, management, and retiree organizations open discussions for adequately funding an amendment to the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 to modify the guaranteed minimum benefit for widows and widowers whose annuities are converted from a spouse to a widow or widower annuity. 
I introduced a provision to allow for the payment of a survivor annuity to divorced widows and widowers of railroad retirees as part of the Women's Pension Equity Act of 1996. Under current law, a divorced spouse can receive certain retiree benefits but these end when the retiree dies. This loss of benefits can be devastating for divorced spouses who have been supporting themselves in their old age. 
I am working to correct this illogical and unjust provision in the law, but without increasing survivor benefits, all widows and widowers, whether married or divorced, are at risk. Having survivor benefits today is not a guarantee of a secure retirement. 
This resolution requires no expenditures of taxpayer funds, but merely expresses the intent of Congress that the issue of inadequate retirement income for widows and widowers of railroad retirees be resolved. This concurrent resolution was submitted in the House of Representatives by Congressman Jack Quinn, as House Concurrent Resolution 52. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this concurrent resolution to improve retirement security for tens of thousands of widows and widowers across the country.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, along with a number of my colleagues, the Public School Modernization Act of 1998. This legislation addresses one of the most fundamental problems with public education in America, and that is that many of our elementary and secondary schools are literally falling down around our children. 
The Public School Modernization Act of 1998 will help States and school districts finance their school improvement priorities. It will help them modernize classrooms so that no child misses out on the information age. It will help them ease overcrowding so that no child is forced to learn the principles of geometry in a gymnasium. It will help them patch leaky roofs, fix broken plumbing, and strengthen the facilities that provide the foundation for our children's education. Without this support, schools will continue to crumble under the weight of deferred maintenance and neglect, and our children's education, and their future, and our Nation's future, will suffer as a result. 
Education in America correlates with opportunity for individuals, but also for our country as a whole. The rungs of the ladder of opportunity in America are crafted in the classroom. Consider that high school graduates earn 46 percent more each year than those who don't graduate from high school. College graduates earn 155 percent more every year than those who do not graduate from high school. Over the course of a lifetime, the most educated Americans will earn five times as much as the least educated Americans. So education is clearly related to individual prosperity and the ability of people to function in this new economy. 
Education also correlates to almost all indicia of economic and social well-being. Educational attainment can directly be tied to income, to health, to the likelihood of being on welfare, to the likelihood of being incarcerated in a prison, and to the likelihood of voting and participating in our democracy. 
However, education is more than a tool simply to lift people out of poverty or to provide a better standard of living for individuals. It is also the engine that will drive America's economy in the 21st century. In a Wall Street Journal survey last year of leading U.S. economists, 43 percent of them said that the single most important thing that we could do to increase our long-term economic growth would be to invest more in education and research and development. Nothing else came close to education in that survey. One economist said, `One of the few things that economists will agree upon is the fact that economic growth is very strongly dependent on our own abilities.' 
A recent study by the Manufacturing Institute concluded that increasing the education level of workers by 1 year raises the productivity level by 8.5 percent in manufacturing. Imagine, Mr. President, if you will, that in this global economy, the only way we will be able to hold on to our position as the country in the world with the highest standard of living is if we prepare our work force--as a whole, all of our workers--to compete at the highest level of competition and to produce at the highest level of productivity. 
The Public School Modernization Act of 1998 represents the kind of investment that will result in better futures for our children and a better future for our country. The bill strengthens the fundamental tenet of American education--local control. By helping schools finance their capital improvement priorities, the Federal Government can free local resources for educational activities and can help give communities the kind of buildings that they need before they can implement the kinds of school reforms that parents and educators are demanding. 
The Public School Modernization Act of 1998 creates a simple, 
effective, and easy-to-administer means of helping communities modernize their schools. The bill creates a new category of zero coupon bonds for States and school districts to issue to finance capital improvements. It allocates $21.8 billion worth of bonding authority to States and large school districts over the next 2 years. 
Over 5 years, the bill will cost our National Government only $3.3 billion, but $21.8 billion worth of new construction and modernization will be made available by that $3.3 billion, which means for every Federal dollar that we invest over the next 5-year period, there will be an additional 6.6 in State and local dollars. That is a pretty good leverage capacity from this kind of investment. 
Perhaps most important, though, Mr. President, is that this bill is bureaucracy-free, or as close to bureaucracy-free as we can manage. States and school districts need only to comply with two main requirements before issuing these new school modernization bonds. First, they must conduct a survey of their school facility needs, which you would think that every school district would have already, but the truth is they don't, yet. Second, they must describe how they intend to allocate the bonding authority to assure that schools with the greatest needs and the least resources benefit. That is it. Those are the only strings. There is no reapplying for funds, no continuous oversight, no getting individual projects approved by some Federal agency. The plan is simple. It will work. And it will strengthen local schools. 
Mr. President, the magnitude of the school facilities problem is so great today that many districts cannot maintain the kind of educational environment necessary to teach all of our children the kinds of skills they will need to compete in the 21st century, global economy. 
We commissioned a study by the GAO a couple years ago. What they concluded was that every day some 14 million children in this country--14 million children--attend schools in need of major renovations or outright replacement, 7 million children every day attend schools with life-threatening safety code violations, and it will cost $112 billion to bring the schools up to code. This is not bells and whistles, this is not equipping them with computers and fancy new cosmetics, but just to address the toll that decades of deferred maintenance have taken on our school facilities across this country. 
In my State of Illinois, school modernization and construction needs top $13 billion. Many of our school districts have a difficult time enough just buying textbooks, pencils, and teacher salaries, let alone financing capital improvements. This would free local resources for education by providing Federal support for bricks and mortar. 
By the way, the national school repair price tag, as enormous as it sounds, does not include the cost of wiring our schools for modern technology. One of the greatest barriers to the incorporation of modern computers into classrooms is the physical condition of many school buildings. You can't very well use a computer if you don't have an electrical system working in the wall to plug it into. According to the GAO study, almost half of all schools--half of all schools--lack enough electrical power for the full-scale use of computers, 60 percent lack the conduits to connect classroom computers to a network, and more than 60 percent of the schools lack enough phone lines for instructional use. 
Last year, principal Rita Melius from Waukegan, IL, came to Washington and told of her experience with computer technology at her school. She thought she was doing the right thing by equipping her schools with modern school technology, but when she deployed the computers around the schools, fires started in the building because the wiring was so old. 
Her experience is being replicated all over this country as communities try to bring their schools into the information age. This legislation will give Ms. Melius, and others like her, the resources to modernize their classrooms. 
Mr. President, it will also give communities the power to relieve overcrowding. According to the U.S. Department of Education, just to keep up with growing enrollment, we will need to build some 6,000 new schools over the next 10 years. 
I have visited schools in Illinois where study halls are being held in the hallways, literally, because there is no other space. I have seen stairway landings converted into computer labs. I have seen cardboard partitions used to turn one classroom into two. I point out, Mr. President, that particular school was in what could be called a basement. It wasn't exactly a basement, it was at ground level, but they had cardboard separating two classes from each other. There is a school, frankly, where the lunchroom has been converted into two classrooms, where students eat in the gymnasium. And instead of having gym, they have `adaptive physical education' while they stand next to their desks, because the gyms are being used for lunchrooms. It is really shameful, Mr. President, and it is the situation that we find in almost a third of the schools in this country. 
Again, I point out that this phenomenon is not just an inner-city problem. It exists in rural communities and suburban communities as well--just about one-third in each type of community across the United States. 
Teachers and parents know full well that these conditions directly affect the ability of their children to learn, and research backs up that intuition. Two separate studies found a 10 to 11 percent achievement gap between those students in good buildings and those in shabby or poor buildings, after controlling for all other factors. 
Other studies have found that when buildings are in poor condition, students are more likely to misbehave. Three leading researchers recently concluded, `. . .there's no doubt that building condition affects academic performance.' 
This morning, in a press conference in which a student from a local school talked about overcrowded conditions, he mentioned that they were having discipline problems from fights breaking out from what he called `hall rage,' because the overcrowding situation in the school was so perverse and extreme that students were literally bumping into each other trying to move from class to class. So we have a situation here in which academic performance is affected. 
I think it is time to mention something at this point. We just saw, this week, the grades come in on an international math and science test. The results were profoundly disturbing. American students scored close to the bottom, or at the bottom, on every math and physics test offered. 
Now, here we are. A new study of high school seniors in 23 countries shows U.S. students scored significantly lower than students in other countries. This is in math, nations with scores above the international level: Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland, and Norway. Nations with scores close to the international average: Italy, Russia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, and the United States. Nations lower than the international level: Cyprus and South Africa. We are in the category of nations with scores lower than the international level, which includes: France, Russia, Switzerland, Denmark, Cyprus, Lithuania, Australia, Greece, Sweden, Canada, Slovenia, Italy, Czech Republic, Germany, and the United States is next to last in advanced mathematics. In physics: Norway, Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Slovenia, Germany, Australia, Cyprus, Latvia, Greece, Switzerland, Canada, France, Czech Republic, Austria, and the United States. We are last. From the President down to the local township officials, this should be a clarion call that we have to work to improve the quality of our schools. 
Our school facilities problems directly result, Mr. President, from our archaic school funding formula and system. The current 
system, the way we fund schools, was established a century ago when the Nation's wealth was measured in terms of property wealth, in terms of landholdings. Wealth is no longer accumulated just in land, and the funding mechanism that ties funding of our education to the local property tax is no longer appropriate, nor is it adequate. 
Again, according to the GAO, poor and middle-class school districts try the hardest to raise revenue from the property tax, but the system works against them. In some 35 States, poor districts--that is, districts with smaller property tax bases--have higher tax rates than wealthy districts, but they raise less revenue because there is less property wealth to tax. 
This local funding model, this model of depending on the local property tax to fund education, does not work for school infrastructure, just as it would not work for our highways or any other infrastructure. 
It is ironic that we are here talking about the highway bill. Imagine what would happen if we based our system of roads on the same funding model we use for education. Imagine if every community was responsible for the construction and maintenance of the roads within its borders. In all likelihood, we would see smooth, good roads in the wealthy towns, a patchwork of mediocre roads in middle-income towns, and very few roads at all in poor communities. Transportation would be hostage to the vagaries of wealth and geography. Commerce and travel would be difficult, and navigation of such a system would not serve the best interests of our whole country. That hypothetical, unfortunately, precisely describes the way that we fund our public education system. 
I believe we need a new approach. We need a partnership among all levels of government and the private sector that preserves local control in education but creates a financing balance that better serves local property taxpayers, children, schools, and indeed our entire country. This new act I am introducing today represents such a new partnership. It is a simple and effective means of leveraging limited Federal resources, strengthening local control of education, and improving the educational opportunity for every child. 
I urge my colleagues to take a close look at the needs of the schools in their own States and decide what they stand for: higher property taxes and crumbling schools, or lower property taxes and a new partnership to improve our schools for the 21st century. I believe that we have some opportunities here. 
Again, I have visited a lot of schools and I have seen what happens when we engage the resources sufficient to provide an environment and support needed for our children to learn. American kids are no dumber than kids anywhere else in the world. There is no reason for us to be at the bottom of this international testing. It is not their fault. It is our fault for failing to engage appropriately, to give public education the kind of support that it needs to have. 
Now, there is some good news I would like to call to your attention. A group of some 20 Illinois school districts, led by Superintendent Paul Kimmelman, banded together to form a group called the First in the World Consortium. Their goal was to score first in the world on the international math and science test. At the same time that these results came out, Mr. President, the results from the First in the World Consortium came out also. They succeeded. The students in that consortium placed first in the world when compared with other countries, which is far above the dismal performance of our country as a whole. 
What does this consortium have that the schools in our country lack? It is not the makeup of students. The kids are as capable anywhere in the country, whether they come from rich families or poor families. We have some of the brightest students in the world, who need only the opportunity to learn. The difference, however, is what supports we, as a community, a national community, can provide for them--schools with first-rate facilities, small classes, modern technology, and supportive communities. 
So I hope that we will all take a look at the importance of this legislation. This is a way that we can engage the support of the National Government, our national community, acting in our national interest to serve our most important resource, which is our children. If we don't invest in them and if we don't build up these schools, many of which were built--I am making an assumption about age, but when you and I were in grammar school, Mr. President, these schools were built almost a generation ago and, in many instances, more than a generation ago. That generation saw fit to provide facilities that were suitable for learning. That we have not, I believe, speaks volumes for us. 
I think our generation has an absolute obligation and duty to provide for this generation, the next generation of Americans, no less an opportunity than we inherited from the last generation of Americans. We have a duty to see to it that they have the ability to get educated and to take their talent as far as those talents will take them, to maximize the ability of every person to rise to the absolute best level that he or she can, based on his or her natural talents. 
Those natural talents, though, Mr. President, have to be nurtured in an environment and in facilities that are suitable for learning. This legislation will begin, hopefully, to create the kind of partnership that will allow the National, State, and local governments to stop the finger-pointing, stop the blame game, stop pushing the buck, and say it is somebody else's duty, or responsibility, or fault, and allow us to come together on behalf of what is clearly in our interest as citizens not only of cities and States and local communities, but as citizens of this great country. 
This is why we have to come together. This is why we have to put the old, tired arguments behind us. This is why I think we should take a variety of ideas and put them out so that we can reach a consensus on getting some results, getting results that will serve our children's interests. 
The public certainly wants us to do it. According to a bipartisan poll released earlier this year, some 76 percent of registered voters would support a $30 billion, 10-year Federal commitment to rebuild and modernize our schools. This legislation provides for that kind of a partnership. I certainly hope, Mr. President, that the Members of this body will review the GAO reports regarding their own States, because this is not just an Illinois problem, this is not just a North Carolina problem, or a Wyoming problem; this is a problem for America, and every State in this country has the same problem in the same ways. I urge them to examine the reports by the General Accounting Office regarding the condition of schools in their States, I ask them to examine the report of the General Accounting Office regarding the property tax dependence in their States, and I urge them to sign on and cosponsor this legislation.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I want to commend the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for assembling this important legislation, and I want to thank President Clinton for articulating a vision for America that includes a significant federal commitment toward improving the quality and accessibility of education for all Americans. The RESULTS Act is designed to help fulfill that commitment, and represents the type of action this Congress should take to prepare America for the 21st century. 
I visited a number of schools in Illinois over the past several months, and talked with parents, teachers, children, and school officials at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. I found that without exception, education is at the top of their minds. Illinoisans, like most Americans, support policies designed to help ensure that America remains preeminent in the intensely competitive, global economy of the 21st century. 
Last year, this Congress took historic measures to improve the accessibility of quality higher education, with the enactment of President Clinton's HOPE Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credits. We also restored the student loan interest deduction, so that graduates now receive a Federal income tax deduction when they make interest payments on their student loans. I intend to work this year to broaden the deduction we created last year, so that more former students, struggling under a burden of debt that has grown enormously in recent years, can make ends meet. 
Now, this Congress must act to improve the quality of elementary and secondary education available to our children. We must act to ensure that as we approach the 21st century, no child is left behind. We must act to ensure that no child is forced to try to learn in an overcrowded classroom or a crumbling school, and that every child has access to the kinds of technologies he or she will need to understand to compete in the next millennium. 
The RESULTS Act will help States and school districts improve their schools for the 21st century, and includes a number of very important provisions, including a plan to create a new partnership between the Federal government and State and local governments to rebuild and modernize our school buildings. Under this new proposal, States and school districts would be able to issue new, zero-interest bonds to modernize and build schools. Bondholders would receive Federal income tax credits in lieu of interest payments. Using this mechanism, the Federal government can leverage almost $22 billion worth of school improvements, at a cost of only $3.3 billion over the next five years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. 
According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, it will cost $112 billion to bring existing school buildings up to code--to patch the leaky roofs, replace the broken windows, fix the plumbing, and make other needed repairs. That price tag, as enormous as it sounds, does not include the cost of building new schools to accommodate the record numbers of children who are crowding our schools, nor the cost of upgrading classrooms for modern computers. 
This problem has overwhelmed the fiscal capacities of state and local authorities. It is a problem affecting all areas of the country, because it is a direct result of the antiquated way we pay for public education in this country. The local property tax, which made sense as a funding mechanism when wealth was accumulated in the form of land, no longer works as a means of funding major capital investments. In urban, rural, and suburban schools all across the country, the magnitude of the crumbling schools problem has dwarfed local financing capabilities. It is a problem that directly affects the ability of students to learn, teachers to teach, and schools to implement the kinds of educational reform efforts that parents are demanding to improve the quality of education in this country. 
According to academic data correlating building conditions and student achievement, children in these decrepit classrooms have less of a chance. Their education is at risk. They will be less able to compete in the 21st century job market. Ultimately, we will all come out on the losing end. America can't compete if its students can't learn, and our students can't learn if their schools are falling down. 
The legislation being introduced today gives Congress a historic opportunity to jump start the process of rebuilding, renovating, modernizing, and constructing new schools to meet the needs of all our children into the 21st century. The RESULTS Act engages the federal government in the support of elementary and secondary education in a way that preserves local control of education. In the same way the federal government helps finance highways, but the state and local governments decide where the roads go, the federal government can help state and local authorities rebuild our schools. America has a $112 billion infrastructure problem that makes it increasingly difficult for our students to learn the skills they will need to keep America competitive in the 21st century. Now is the time for Congress to act. 
I want to congratulate the Democratic leader again for his work on this bill, as well as President Clinton and Secretary Riley, who helped shape many of its provisions. I hope the 105th Congress will approve this legislation quickly, and renew the promise embodied in the words of the 19th century American poet James Russell Lowell, who wrote: `. . . [I]t was in making education not only common to all, but in some sense compulsory on all, that the destiny of the free republics of America was practically settled.'

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Thank you, very much. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for yielding time. I will be very brief because I know time is short. In addition, I would like to make some comments regarding the underlying bill, the ISTEA bill. 
But, in the first instance, with regard to this amendment, I am very, very pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment and proud 
to stand in support of it today. We were over at the White House this afternoon for an announcement regarding this important amendment, the .08 amendment. I was just so struck by the families who were there who had lost young ones, who had lost family members to drunk drivers; struck, also, by the fact that what is being called for in this legislation is ultimately very, very reasonable. 
This legislation is not prohibition. It does not require someone not to drink at all. What it says essentially is you not get plastered when you get behind the wheel, and not get so impaired in your physical capacity that you put other pedestrians and other drivers at risk. 
Listening to the mother this morning talk about how she was taking her daughter to the schoolbus when a drunk driver just came out of nowhere and took the little girl's life was enough to send chills through the heart of any mother, any parent, and certainly ought to commit our attention to the gravity of this matter and the importance of it. 
There is no question but that the .08 blood alcohol level saves lives. Studies have shown that States which have adopted .08 laws have had significant drops in alcohol-related traffic deaths and that a national .08 law could prevent up to 600 deaths a year. That does not even take into account the injuries, the loss of capacity, the trauma to people that could be avoided as well--just in fatalities alone, 500 to 600 fatalities a year. 
My home State of Illinois has a .08 limit. 
I want to report to everybody who is looking at this issue that the results were immediate and dramatic upon the adoption of this statute by the Illinois legislature. In the first holiday weekend in Illinois, under the .08 statute, which was the 4th of July, 1997, alcohol-related fatalities were 68 percent lower than the same period in 1996--68 percent fewer deaths on a weekend. That is a dramatic result from a simple step that is a reasonable step and that ought to be taken for this entire country. 
The question has been raised whether or not this is something the States themselves can do. I would point out that, again, my State of Illinois has a .08 level. Other States have higher levels. It should not be an accident of geography for Americans to be secure in the knowledge that drunk drivers will not confront them on the highways. Individuals should be able to have the confidence that if they cross over the border from Illinois to Indiana, or Illinois to Wisconsin, or Illinois to Missouri, that they will enjoy the same safety that they do in our State. 
I think that this is a commonsense law, a commonsense amendment, it is a life-saving amendment, and certainly an amendment whose time has come. I urge my colleagues to support the Lautenberg-DeWine .08 amendment to ISTEA. 
Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent--I ask the manager of the bill--to be allowed to speak on the underlying bill and that it not be charged to this amendment.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, the good news about ISTEA today is that an agreement has been ratified by the committee that will provide $26 billion in additional funding to improve our Nation's highways. The better news for States like mine and for the Nation's intermodal transportation system is that this additional money will be distributed in more effective and fairer ways than the rest of the money authorized under ISTEA. This addition to the underlying ISTEA formula will make this landmark legislation better serve the interests of our entire country. I congratulate the budget negotiators and the members of the committee for their sensitivity to the needs of States like Illinois and to the role of transportation as an activity that touches all of our country and brings us together as a people. 
My home State of Illinois serves as the transportation hub for our Nation's commerce. It is home to the world's busiest airport and two of the world's busiest rivers. It is where the Nation's freight railroads come together to move goods from one side of the country to another. It is the center of the Nation's truck traffic. If you add up the value of all truck shipments in the country, Illinois has by far the largest share of any State. If you count the ton-miles of truck shipments that pass through States on their way to their final destinations, Illinois has by far the largest share of any State. 
This map shows very clearly how we are the hub. We are the hub not only for the Midwest but, really, we are the crossroads of the country. 
Illinois's roads, therefore, must literally bear the weight of the largest share of the Nation's commercial activity and our roads are suffering as a result. According to some estimates, nearly 43 percent of Illinois roads need repair, and almost one-fourth of our bridges are in substandard condition. Every year, Illinois motorists pay an estimated $1 billion in vehicle wear and tear and other expenses associated with poor road conditions. 
In Chicago the traffic flow on some of the major highways has increased sevenfold since those highways were built in the 1950s and in the 1960s. According to a recent study, Chicago is the fifth most congested city in America. 
Today's agreement provides relief to Illinois and to our Nation's transportation system, above and beyond the original ISTEA proposal. Today's agreement creates a new program, targeted toward high-density States like Illinois. The plan allocates $1.8 billion over the next 5 years for this program, of which Illinois will receive at least $36 million, and up to $54 million, a year. All told, Illinois will receive approximately $900 million more for highway improvements over the next 6 years under the agreement approved this morning by the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
This is very good news for Chicago area residents who are counting on Federal funds to fix the Stevenson Expressway, and not just Chicago area residents but everybody who comes through the State using the Stevenson. This highway was built in 1964 and has become one of the most important arteries in the area, making connections to the Tri-State Tollway and the Dan Ryan Expressway. The road, the Stevenson, is literally falling apart. The State has asked for $175 million over the next 2 years to aid in this project, and today's agreement provides enough additional funds to Illinois, an additional $200 million every year for the next 6 years, and with that money the State will be able to repair the Stevenson on the schedule that is most desirable to facilitate traffic. 
There is more good news. Wacker Drive, a major two-level road in the heart of downtown Chicago, is collapsing. If anyone has ever driven Wacker Drive in Chicago--it is green, and we used to call it Emerald City down there, but it's a double-decker road. According to a recent report, water leaks through joints of the double-decker road when it rains, loosening already fractured concrete and threatening to pour chunks of debris onto vehicles on the lower level. If no repairs are made, Wacker Drive will have to 
be closed in 5 years. This agreement allows not only for full funding of the Stevenson repair, but additional funding for Wacker Drive. 
There is more good news, even greater good news for natives of western Illinois who are counting on Federal assistance for a variety of projects along U.S. 67, which runs from just outside of St. Louis, in the southwest corner of Illinois, to the Quad Cities in the northwest corner. So, over in this area. 
There are literally hundreds of road repair projects planned in my State, and today's agreement goes a long way toward turning those plans into actual road improvements. 
I want to thank Senator Chafee, Senator Baucus and Senator Lautenberg for their hard work in putting this arrangement together. 
Now, this, today's announcement, I am so pleased about this part of it, but I think I would be remiss in not mentioning my sadness that we have not been able to do better by mass transit. We have increased, in this agreement, transportation spending by $26 billion, but not one additional dime will be devoted to mass transit improvements. Historically, there has been a split between spending increases for surface transportation and mass transit in an 80/20 ratio. Preserving this ratio is, I think, essential to ensuring the viability of transit systems around the country. 
Mass transportation not only moves people from one place to another; it helps the environment. Without public transportation, without public transit, there would be 5 million more cars on the road and 27,000 more lane miles of road, again increasing the pollution of our environment. Transit is also a great economic investment. The net economic return on public expenditures for public transportation is 4 or 5 to 1. When mass transit improvements are made, land values go up, commercial development increases, jobs are created and people can get where the jobs are. They can get to work. Without transit, congestion alone would cost our national economy some $15 billion annually. In the Chicago area, in my State, congestion and bottlenecks already sap economic productivity, it is estimated, by about $2.8 billion every year. Without the additional investments in the area's transit system, that number could increase. 
Again, it is regrettable that we have not been able to do more for mass transit. We have great needs. The Regional Transportation Authority of Northeastern Illinois, the Chicago Transit Authority, Metra, and all of the transit authorities in the State, are in dire need of additional support. I hope before this legislation is finalized, we will understand the importance of mass transit to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, to the efficiency of our surface transportation effort in this country. 
But in the meantime, I did want to take this opportunity--I thank Senator Chafee for indulging me this time--but also to say thank you to him and the other budget negotiators for the additions and for the improvements, in my opinion, to the underlying formula. I think this goes a long way, again, to achieving the goals of the ISTEA, achieving the goals of intermodal surface transportation efficiency. 
We ought to talk about transportation as a people issue, which it really is. It's not just about roads and bridges and cars and trucks; it is about the people of this country being connected one to the other and being able to carry out the commerce and the activity that keep this country strong. I thank these negotiators for their work. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation to protect and preserve some of our Nation's most important historic landmarks that are at risk of being lost forever. I speak of buildings located on the campuses of our Nation's 103 historically black colleges and universities. Like so much of our infrastructure, many of the buildings that make up these schools are literally falling down. 
Our Nation's HBCUs have promoted academic excellence for over 130 years. They have produced some of our Nation's most distinguished leaders, including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Thurgood Marshall, our former colleague Harris Wofford, and many current Members of Congress. These schools have distinguished themselves in the field of higher education over the years by maintaining the highest academic standards while increasing educational opportunities for economically- and socially-disadvantaged Americans, including tens of thousands of African-Americans. 
Although they represent only three percent of all U.S. institutions of higher education, HBCUs graduate 33 percent of all African-Americans with bachelor's degrees and 43 percent of all African-Americans who go on to earn their Ph.D.'s. 
Nonetheless, in order to meet the educational needs of these promising individuals, these schools have had to keep their tuition and fees well below those at comparable institutions. The average tuition and fees charged by private historically black colleges and universities, for example, is less than half the average charged by private colleges nationwide. 
HBCUs have also had to keep their costs low in order to increase financial aid for their students, who are disproportionately more dependent on financial aid than students at other U.S. colleges. A study by the United Negro College Fund found that 90 percent of students at private historically black colleges and universities require financial aid, compared with 65 percent of private college students nationally. The study also found that nearly one-half of these students come from families earning less than $25,000. 
Given that historically black colleges and universities have found it increasingly difficult to support student aid, it should not be surprising that they are unable to restore and preserve the historic landmarks that sit on their campuses. 
According to a new report being released today by the U.S. General Accounting Office, $755 million are needed to restore and preserve 712 historic structures on the campuses of historically black colleges and universities. 323 of these structures are already on the National Register of Historic Places. The others are either eligible for the National Register on the basis of State historic preservation officers' surveys or are considered historic by the colleges and universities. 
Some HBCUs have large numbers of historic properties. Talladega College, for example, has 32 properties on the Historic Register and one additional properties eligible for the Historic Register. The college needs $13,239,000 in order to restore and preserve these facilities. 
One of these buildings is Swayne Hall, Talladega's first building. Swayne Hall, which is on the National Register, was built with slave labor in 1852 for the Talladega Baptist Male High School, and later was used to house Federal prisoners during the Civil War. Two of the slaves who helped build Swayne Hall later went on to found Talladega College. Swayne Hall now houses three floors of classrooms and offices, and needs $1.5 million worth of repairs and refurbishment. 
Congress authorized $29 million under the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996 to fund restoration of certain historic buildings on HBCU campuses, including Swayne Hall. Last year, $4 million was appropriated for this purpose. In addition, Congress has provided $4.3 million over the years to the National Park Service to restore other historic properties on the campuses of HBCUs. 
Those actions, while helpful, do not come close to addressing the needs of HBCUs around the country. The legislation I am introducing today will meet those needs. It authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to award $377.5 million to HBCUs to restore and preserve their historic properties. The bill preserves the matching ratio that currently exists, so that when these Federal funds are matched, dollar-for-dollar, HBCUs will have the funds to restore and preserve all their historic structures. 
This legislation will help protect the national treasures found on the campuses of our historically black colleges and universities, and will ensure that these schools can continue to provide a quality education in the 21st century. I urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.

<TEXT>
Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, this resolution, which I introduce with my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Dick Durbin, and which has been cleared on both sides of the aisle, honors the life of Harry Caray, a legendary American and Chicagoan, whom we lost last week at the age of 83. 
Harry Caray's death, which saddened Americans in every corner of this country, marked the end of an outstanding 53-year career as a baseball broadcaster. But before explaining why Harry was so beloved, let me say a few words about his journey from a poor St. Louis neighborhood to the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
Born in 1914, Harry Caray was orphaned in childhood and raised by an aunt. In 1943, while a salesman for a company that made basketball backboards, he wrote a letter to the manager at the St. Louis radio station KMOX, arguing he could do a better job of calling Cardinals baseball games than the station's then announcers. The manager helped Harry get a job at a radio station in Joliet, IL, where he began his career as a broadcaster. After moving to a radio station in Kalamazoo, MI, in 1945, Harry made his way back to St. Louis where he was hired to announce Cardinals games. For a quarter of a century, he was known as `the voice of the St. Louis Cardinals.' 
After parting ways with the Cardinals in 1969, Harry spent the 1970 season broadcasting Oakland A's games. When he signed with the Chicago White Sox in 1971, the team's games were not broadcast on any major AM radio station, so Harry had to call them on a 5,000-watt AM station in LaGrange, IL, and on a small FM station in Evanston. 
Nevertheless, by his second year, Harry was drawing larger audiences on those stations than the 50,000-watt stations he was competing against. 
One night, White Sox owner Bill Veeck noticed that fans sitting under the broadcast booth joined in when Harry sang `Take Me Out to the Ball Game' during the seventh-inning stretch. Veeck decided to place a public-address microphone in the booth while Harry sang, and a new Chicago tradition was created. For more than two decades, Harry led Chicago baseball fans in song during every home game. 
In 1982, Harry signed on as the principal Chicago Cubs announcer. Forty-four percent of White Sox fans sampled in a Chicago Tribune poll said they would follow him to the North Side of the city. Cubs games are broadcast on superstation WGN-TV whose signal is carried by cable systems across the country, and it didn't take long for Harry to develop a national following. 
After suffering a stroke in 1987, Harry was inundated with cards and letters from fans around the United States. Due to the stroke, Harry missed the first six weeks of the 1987 season, and on his first day back, former Cubs announcer and then-President Ronald Reagan called the broadcast booth to wish him well. The President said, `It was never the same without the real voice of the Chicago Cubs.' Harry thanked him, then quickly reported, `And in the excitement, Bob Dernier beat out a bunt down the third-base line.' In other words, announcing the game was important to him. He always put the fans first. 
In 1988, Harry was inducted into the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Hall of Fame, and in 1994 he was awarded entry into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. Perhaps his greatest honor, however, came in 1989, when he was inducted into the broadcasters' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. In his acceptance speech, he said, `I always tried, in each and every broadcast, to serve the fans to the best of my ability. In my mind, they are the unsung heroes of our great game.' 
And why did the fans adore Harry so much? The Tribune eloquently answered that question in an editorial memorializing him. `Broadcasting' doesn't fully capture what Harry Caray did,' the editors wrote. `He exulted in baseball; he reveled in it; he loved it and, by his vocal exuberance, infected others with that love.' A man of the people, he surrounded himself with baseball fans. He often chose to broadcast games from the outfield bleachers (sometimes bare-chested, like his fellow fans) and was known to spend extraordinary lengths of time signing autographs and shaking hands. 
With Harry calling the games, fans knew that one of them was in the broadcast booth. He never failed to say exactly what was on his mind. If he thought a pitcher was doing poorly he would say, `Get him out of there! He's got nothing today!' Once, while calling a game in which White Sox shortstop Bee Bee Richard had made a couple of errors, Caray, noticing Richard pick up a hot-dog wrapper, quipped, `It's the first thing he has picked up all night.' His habit of speaking candidly frequently got him into trouble with his employers, but the fans loved him for it. 
His enthusiasm for the game of baseball and his zest for life came through in all his broadcasts. His trademark habits of shouting `It might be . . . It could be . . . It is! A home run! Holy Cow!' and booming `Cubs win! Cubs win!' endeared him to fans everywhere. He could make a routine play sound like an earthshattering event. As one fan wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times, his descriptions of baseball games on the radio were `so visible, so exciting in the mind's eye that even reality paled in comparison.' 
Mr. President, there has been a great deal of concern in recent years about the state of major league baseball. Commentators have suggested that it has never fully recovered from the strike season a few years ago and that it is losing young fans to football and basketball. But baseball still captures the nation's imagination in ways that cannot be rivaled. It continues to be our national pastime. Recollections of great games and great players are still passed down from parents to children just as they have always been. Harry was part of the reason that the game continues to play a major role in the lives of American families. Consider this tribute, posted on the Web with a multitude of others, after Harry's death: 
I'm a Yankees fan who is brokenhearted at the passing of Harry. He brought such joy to all our lives. He was something real in a pre-packaged age. He brought smiles to my children's faces and helped bring together that beautiful bond a parent and child can share through baseball. My whole family will miss him and that wonderful booming voice. 
Harry recognized something about baseball and the role that it plays in American life that those of us who root for the Cubs and White Sox understand particularly well: The pleasure of going to a baseball game is only loosely connected to whether or not the home team wins. Baseball, a game without a clock played during the summertime, is about timeless days and languid nights. It's about grass and sunshine and hot dogs and a million other things that have nothing to do with which team is ahead. In only seven of Harry's 27 years in Chicago did the team for which he was broadcasting win as many games as it lost. But this was a minor point for Harry, for whom every game represented an opportunity to visit with fans and have fun. Over and over again, whether his team was winning or losing, he would say, `You can't beat fun at the old ballpark.' For Chicagoans and baseball fans all across the nation, the old ballpark will never be quite the same without him. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to say a few words concerning a friend, former colleague, and outstanding public servant, Illinois Senator Penny Severns. Senator Severns, one of the most courageous people I have ever known, lost her long battle with cancer over the weekend at the age of 46. Until the end, she battled for the causes that animated her outstanding political career--a career that began when she was elected as a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention at the age of 20. 
After graduating from Southern Illinois University two years later, Penny served in the Agency for International Development and the Illinois comptroller's office. In 1983, she was elected to the Decatur City Council and, three years after that, she won election to the Illinois Senate. 
Penny's tenure in the Senate was marked by an unwavering commitment to her beliefs that impressed both her allies and opponents. An unabashed liberal in a politically conservative district, she was beloved because she worked tirelessly on behalf of her constituents the people of Illinois. She had an outstanding record of fighting for Illinois workers, women, and children. At the time of her death, Penny, the 1994 Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, was the ranking Democrat on the Senate Revenue Committee and was the principal negotiator for Senate Democrats on issues involving the state budget. She was a champion of fiscal reforms, worked to expand Illinois exports, fought for an emergency medical leave law for workers, and sought to establish a mechanism to help the State track down parents delinquent in their child support payments. 
Penny spent the final months of her life not only battling cancer, but waging a campaign to become Illinois' next Secretary of State. So strong was her commitment to the people of her State that, last year, after a tumor was removed from her skull, she vowed to `wage two campaigns at once.' She said, `The doctors took care of the first battle by removing the tumor. I'll take care of the second battle, which is to continue to serve the citizens * * * and to continue my campaign.' 
Penny's illness began in 1994 with a diagnosis of breast cancer, a disease that her sisters, Patty and Marsha, both battled as well. Patty is currently in remission, but Marsha died in 1992. Too many families across the United States have been ravaged by this terrible scourge. In the United States in 1997, 180,200 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed and 44,000 women died of it. One out of every nine American women will be stricken with the disease during their lifetime. These statistics are unacceptably high. We must redouble our commitment to finding a way to defeat this killer. The nation simply cannot afford to keep losing women like Penny Severns. 
Mr. President, a great many people throughout our nation have come to view politics as a cynical game involving giant egos and inconsequential battles. I would suggest that those individuals take a moment to study the life and career of Penny Severns, who was involved in electoral politics for all the right reasons and cared passionately about the welfare of the people she served. Her accomplishments are not only an inspiration to those of us who continue to work on behalf of the causes she championed, but also serve as a reminder to all Americans of the good work that committed public officials throughout this nation do. The State of Illinois and, indeed, our great nation are poorer for her loss.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank my colleague from Wisconsin. Mr. President, I think the previous speakers have demonstrated--speaking of the Senator from Alabama--that this debate is more than just about money. It really is about our core values and what kind of people we are in this country. 
The argument made on this floor that money is equal to speech is to suggest then that the poor can't speak as loudly as the rich. The reality check is that money magnifies speech, particularly in these times when money can buy technology and access to the mass media in ways that were not available, of course, when the Constitution was written. To suggest that money is equal to speech is the same thing as saying that the rich and the poor have equal rights to sleep under bridges. We have heard that analogy before. We know that is abject nonsense. So it is, in my opinion, abject nonsense to suggest that in a context in which money buys elections the poor have the same rights as the rich. That does not comport with reality. 
The reality check is--and the people know that to be the case; they know that right now--money plays such a role as to buy elections and that elections dictate the direction of our democracy. And so this debate really is about a crisis of inestimable proportion going to the core of what kind of democracy we are going to enjoy in this country. 
I am very pleased that the Senate is again turning its attention to S. 25. It is certainly not a perfect bill. It does not solve all of the problems created by the current state of the law. However, it at least brings us a little bit closer to the sort of comprehensive campaign finance reform that I believe we all desperately need. We have, in my opinion, a responsibility to restore the faith of the American people in the political process that our democracy is as equally open to the poor as it is to the wealthy, that every citizen has the same and equal right to participate in the process of elections and, therefore, the same and equal rights to dictate the direction of our Government. 
At the present time, too many people feel removed from the decisions that affect them in their lives. Many do not believe they are capable of influencing their Government's policies. A League of Women Voters' study found that one of the top three reasons that people fail to vote is the belief that their vote will not make a difference. We saw an expression of the cynicism during the 1994 elections when just 38 percent of all registered voters cast their ballots. We saw it again in 1996 when only 49 percent of the voting age population turned out to vote--the lowest proportion in some 72 years. 
I have noticed in my own State of Illinois a falloff in voter participation and turnout. In 1992, Mr. President, I won my election for the Senate with 2.6 million votes, which represented 53 percent of the total vote. By 1996, when Senator Durbin ran, he won with 2.3 million votes, which was 55 percent of the total votes. Senator Durbin, in other words, won by a greater margin but with fewer votes cast. 
And if our citizens continue to participate in the electoral process in fewer and fewer numbers, the United States runs the risk of jeopardizing its standing as the greatest democracy on Earth. 
Now, campaign finance is diminishing our democracy. Consider for a moment the fact that 59 percent of the respondents in the Gallup/USA Today poll agreed with the statement `Elections are for sale to whoever can raise the most money' while only 37 percent agreed with the statement `Elections are won on the basis of who's the best candidate.' What is causing this perception? The people are aware that we are spending more on congressional campaigns than we ever have before. The Federal Election Commission has reported that congressional candidates spent a record-setting total of $765.3 million in the 1996 elections. That represents an incredible 71 percent increase over the 1990 level of $446.3 million. And those numbers do not even take into account the massive expenditures of `soft money' by political parties on behalf of House and Senate candidates. 
The average winning campaign for the House cost over $673,000 in 1996. That's a 30 percent increase over 1994, when the average House seat cost its occupant $516,000. In 1996, 94 candidates for the House spent more than a million dollars to get elected. Winning Senate candidates spent an average of $4.7 million in 1996. In that year, 92 percent of House races and 88 percent of Senate races were won by the candidate who spent the most money. Forty-three of the 53 open-seat House races and 12 of the 14 open-seat Senate races were won by the candidate who spent the most money. 
One of the major factors responsible for these huge costs increases in the avalanche of negative advertising that has muddied the political landscape in recent years. Political figures have come to rightly expect that they will be attacked from every imaginable angle come election time and are raising more and more money to fend off charges that often have nothing to do with the people's business. Moreover, politics has become so vicious and negative over the last few years that able public officials are leaving public service and potentially outstanding candidates are choosing not to run at all. These individuals know that politicians today have to spend a large portion of their time raising money, and that is simply not an attractive job description for many people capable of making outstanding contributions to our government. For example, in explaining his retirement from government service, former Senator Paul Simon, one of the most able individuals ever to sit in this chamber, cited fundraising responsibilities as a burden that he no longer wished to bear. 
All of the problems associated with the immense role that money plays in the electoral system have been exacerbated in recent years by an increase in the number of wealthy candidates contributing outlandish sums to their own campaigns. In 1994, for example, one candidate for the Senate spent a record $29 million, 94 percent of which was his own money. During the 1996 election cycle, candidates for federal office contributed $161 million to their own campaigns. One presidential candidate helped finance his campaign with $37.4 million of his own money. Fifty-four Senate candidates and 91 House candidates put $100,000 or more of their own money into their campaigns, either through contributions or loans. It is true that in 1996 only 19 of those candidates won their elections, but the fact remains that the current system allows such candidates to drive up the costs of campaigns and make it more difficult for average citizens to contend for political office. If we allow this trend to continue, it won't be long before only the wealthiest Americans will be able to fully participate in the political process. 
The time has come to reduce the role that money plays in our electoral system. Besides providing elected officials with more time to tend to the people's business, doing so will result in fewer negative ads, for if a candidate has less money to spend or faces a spending limit, he or she will have to be more careful about how expenditures are made. The capacity to run fewer ads would help ensure that candidates focus on establishing a connection with the voters by using television and radio time to discuss their stands on the issues, instead of running negative ads.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Madam President, I would like to take a moment to commend my colleagues for voting `no' this morning on the effort to shut down debate and take up S. 1601, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 1998 without hearings or the benefit of a comprehensive Committee review of the bill. 
At the outset, I want to make it clear that I stand with the vast majority of Americans who oppose efforts to clone human beings. S. 1601, however, does much more than that. The bill includes a permanent ban on the act of human somatic cell nuclear transfer, which means taking the nucleus--which contains DNA--from a mature cell and putting it into an egg cell from which the original nucleus has been removed. Although the bill defines the product of such a transfer as an embryo, it is not actually a fertilized egg, as that term is commonly understood. It is an unfertilized egg cell that contains DNA from another source. It is true that if this cell were implanted in a woman's womb, it could very well develop into a baby. However, the cell may also be grown in a laboratory to become skin, nerve, or muscle tissue. 
Because of its ban on human somatic cell transfer, there is a strong likelihood that S. 1601 would extinguish biomedical research in several vital areas. Scientists are examining approaches to treating disease that won't depend on drugs, but on stem cells that can differentiate into brain, skin, blood, or heart cells. S. 1601 would put an end to such research whenever somatic cell nuclear transfer is involved. Thus, it would outlaw efforts to create cardiac muscle cells to treat heart attack victims and degenerative heart disease; skin cells to treat burn victims; spinal cord neuron cells for the treatment of spinal cord trauma and paralysis; neural cells to treat those suffering from Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Lou Gehrig's disease; blood cells to treat cancer anemia and immunodeficiencies; cells for use in genetic therapy to treat 5,000 genetic diseases, including cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs, schizophrenia, and depression; liver cells for the treatment of such diseases as hepatitis and cirrhosis; and myriad other cells for use in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of a multitude of serious and life-threatening medical conditions. 
Consider the effect that S. 1601 would have on research related to the treatment of diabetes. A diabetes patient has a shortage of insulin-producing cells in her pancreas. Somatic cell nuclear transfer technology may allow for the transplantation of a large number of insulin-producing cells into the diabetic patient that would be genetically identical to her. As a result, rejection would not be an issue and the patient would be cured. S. 1601 would stifle research into this promising approach to the treatment of diabetes. 
Moreover, S. 1601 would prevent doctors from utilizing certain treatments that already exist, such as an effective therapy for mitochondrial disease, which causes infertility in women. 
In sum, too much is at stake to allow legitimate concerns over human cloning to quash the beneficial research and existing treatments associated with somatic cell nuclear transfer. Over 120 medical research, industry, and patient advocacy organizations have expressed the view that S. 1601 would do just that. That is why I am co-sponsor of Senator Feinstein and Senator Kennedy's substitute bill, S. 1602. This legislation, drafted with the assistance of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC), the National Institutes of Health, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Biotech Industry Association, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Food and Drug Administration, imposes a 10-year ban on the implantation of the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer into a women's uterus. While it bans the cloning of human beings for 10 years, the bill does not prohibit the cloning of molecules, DNA, cells, tissues, or non-human animals. It therefore does not restrict important biomedical and agricultural research that will improve the quality of life for millions of Americans and save the lives of many more.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, the position of Surgeon General was created in 1870 and played a vital role in fighting infectious diseases and other threats to public safety. Communicating with the American public about the health of their families and communities is probably the most important responsibility of a Surgeon General. This person serves as our nation's chief spokesperson for public health. This is the bully pulpit from which we may be lead down the path to a strong, healthy, and productive society. 
After nearly eight years of dormancy, President Reagan recognized the importance of a national health leader in 1981 and revived the position of Surgeon General with the nomination of Dr. C. Everett Koop. At the time, this too was a very controversial nominee, but the Congress and nation grew to deeply respect his leadership. Dr. Koop and his successors made tremendous strides in educating the public about the spread of AIDS, the prevalence of domestic violence, and the need to control out-of-wedlock births. There should be no doubt that Dr. David Satcher will continue this legacy. 
This critically important post has been vacant for three years and our nation does not have anymore time to spare. The longer the Senate delays this appointment, the greater the lost opportunity to improve public health. For example, there is a developing consensus across the nation about the need to reduce teen smoking. Three thousand children become permanent smokers every day. We need a Surgeon General in place to spearhead a national strategy to meet the challenge of teen smoking. 
Mr. President, I have listened to a lot of the debate on this nomination. I want to offer my support to Dr. Satcher and highlight some the experiences and qualities that make him the right person for this position.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. There can be no doubt that Dr. Satcher is eminently qualified to be Surgeon General. He has spearheaded successful public health improvements at each stage of his career. As director of the Centers for Disease Control, he lead four important advancements in public health which distinguished his tenure there. 
Under his leadership, childhood immunization rates have risen to a record 78 percent. Vaccines have become more affordable and vaccine-preventable childhood illnesses have fallen to the lowest level in history. 
All states now participate in the special breast and cervical cancer screening program due to Dr. Satcher's leadership. When he became CDC director in 1993, only 18 states were participating in this program. In almost two-thirds of the nation, women were excluded from this early outreach and cancer detection program. Today, more than one million women are receiving cancer screening tests and 21,000 cases of treatable cervical cancer have been identified. This is the result of Dr. Satcher's leadership. 
Further, he led the development of a comprehensive strategy to combat infectious diseases. Recent outbreaks of e. coli and other bacterial infections, as well as the reemergence of malaria and cholera, have raised national awareness. Dr. Satcher brought networks of physicians and clinics together to monitor emerging diseases and formed an innovative seven-state surveillance program. 
Finally, Dr. Satcher also developed an early warning system to respond to outbreaks of food-borne illnesses. Food safety is clearly one of our nation's most important issues, particularly so given the increasing globalization of trade. As more imported foods products find their way to Americans' dinner tables, having a strong food safety systems in place will be vital. Thankfully, the early warning system established by Dr. Satcher was in place last year to catch salmonella contaminated alfalfa sprouts and e. coli contaminated lettuce and apple cider which might have caused a public health tragedy. 
These are just four examples of improvements in public health Dr. Satcher has achieved during his tenure as CDC director. These are the types of results and initiatives that Dr. Satcher would continue to work towards in his role as Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health. 
Concerns have been raised during this debate about Dr. Satcher's limited involvement in controversial HIV/AIDS studies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. I share many of these concerns and wrote to the President in this regard in April of last year. Subsequently, I discussed these concerns at length with Dr. Satcher and others in the scientific community. They advised me that, useful medical research and clinical trials in developing countries often pose special challenges. The resources available to people of developing worlds are not comparable to resources available to individuals in this country. Even though I strongly disagree with their conclusions, I understand scientists' belief that we may need to balance our research standards in this country with the public health needs in developing nations. 
This issue poses a debate concerning medical ethics which is yet unresolved in the scientific community. We can certainly not expect to resolve it with this nomination process. Dr. Satcher's position on these studies is not central to whether he would serve the nation well as Surgeon General. We can have the professional disagreement over the merits of the HIV studies, but the defining question should be whether this individual, is qualified for the challenges of the position. I believe unequivocally, that Dr. Satcher has that ability, the experience, and commitment to be an excellent Surgeon General. 
It is reasonable for many of us to have various disagreements with nominees for executive branch posts. This ability to voice opposition and debate ideas is what makes our democracy great. At the end of the day, however, reason should prevail. The President has done the country a service by nominating such an outstanding candidate. Dr. Satcher is qualified to be Surgeon General and would be the first family physician to hold the post. What better person to be the nation's doctor? I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting his confirmation.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today, my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and I are recommending that President Clinton nominate David Herndon and Jeanne Scott for federal judgeships in the Southern and Central Districts of Illinois. David Herndon has been a highly respected Illinois Circuit Court judge since 1991. Prior to that, he practiced for 14 years, developing a real expertise in complex litigation. Jeanne Scott has served as an Illinois state judge for 18 years. She is currently the Division Chief for Civil cases in Sangamon County. She has a sterling reputation as a dedicated and fair judge. She will be the first female federal judge in the history of the Central District of Illinois. It is therefore an appropriate moment for me to say a few words about a matter of critical importance: the exceptionally large number of judicial vacancies in our federal court system. 
Currently, there are 83 vacancies in the federal judiciary. This accounts for approximately one out of every ten federal judges. Twenty-five of the vacancies have been in existence for 18 months or longer and are therefore regarded as `judicial emergencies.' Over one-third of the seats in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit are vacant. As of last year, the average number of days from nomination to confirmation was at a record high of 183. 
Illinois presently has seven vacant judgeships. One of these, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, dates back to November of 1992. Another, in the Central District, dates back to October of 1994. Two of the nominees for these vacancies are awaiting action by the Senate Judiciary Committee and two are awaiting action by the full Senate. In the Southern District, the chief judge went for more than a year without having time to hear a single civil case because his criminal docket was so full. In the Central District, major civil trials have had to be postponed because of the shortage of judges. Commenting on the imminent retirement of a third judge in his district, Marvin Aspen, the chief judge of the Northern District, recently told the Chicago Sun-Times that `if Congress does not move quickly . . . in a short time we could have a serious backlog.' Last week, Judge Aspen called the number of judicial vacancies nationwide `an unprecedented scandal.' 
As Chief Justice Rehnquist stated in his 1997 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary, `Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.' The Chief Justice placed much of the blame squarely on the Senate. He said, `Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed during 1994.' 
By failing to move expeditiously on judicial nominations, the majority party in the Senate is failing to live up to its responsibilities to the American people. President Clinton has made 91 judicial nominations during the 105th Congress, but the Senate has confirmed only 39 of these individuals. As the Chicago Tribune editorialized last month, `If Republicans don't like the choices, let the Senate debate them and vote them down. Doing nothing, as the Senate has done lately, is cowardly and cynical.' 
Worse yet, it is affecting the quality of justice in the United States. The increase in the number of judicial vacancies in combination with the growth in criminal and civil filings has created a huge backlog of federal cases. 
According to Chief Justice Rehnquist, since 1990, the number of cases filed in courts of appeals has increased by 21 percent and those filed in district courts have grown by 24 percent. There was a five percent increase in the criminal caseload in 1997. This resulted in the largest federal criminal caseload in 60 years. 
According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the number of active cases pending for at least three years rose 20 percent from 1995 to 1996. According to the most recent data provided by the Department of Justice, there are more than 16,000 federal cases that are more than three years old. 
Time magazine wrote last year that `some Republicans have as much as declared war on [President] Clinton's choices, parsing every phrase they've written for evidence of what they call judicial activism.' This has discouraged qualified candidates from subjecting themselves to the confirmation process. For instance, last September, Justice Richard P. Goldenhirsch of the Illinois Court of Appeals, withdrew his name from consideration for a federal judgeship, stating that, because of the `poisoned atmosphere of the confirmation process, my nomination would be pending for an indefinite period of time.' He stated that the protracted nature of the process was `particularly unfair to the people of the Southern District of Illinois, who deserve a fully staffed court ready to hear their cases.' 
In condemning President Clinton's judicial nominations, one of my Republican colleagues described the judicial branch last year as being full of `renegade judges, [who are] a robed, contemptuous intellectual elite.' And in explaining why the confirmation of a California appeals court judge had been delayed for two years, a senior member of the Republican majority stated, `If you want to blame somebody for the slowness of approving judges to the Ninth Circuit, blame the Clinton and Carter appointees who have been ignoring the law and are true examples of activist judging.' 
The President's record of judicial appointments belies any assertion that he has sought to stack the federal judiciary with the types of judges referred to by my colleagues. The New York Times commented last year that what `may be most notable about Clinton's judicial appointments may be reluctance to fill the court with liberal judges.' The Times noted that a statistical analysis by three scholars `confirms the notion that the ideology of Clinton's appointees falls somewhere between the conservatives selected by [Presidents] Bush and Reagan and the liberals chosen by President Carter.' The Times quoted an author of the study, Professor Donald Songer of the University of South Carolina, as stating that Clinton's appointments were `decidedly less liberal than other modern Democratic presidents.' Professor Songer stated that, from an ideological standpoint, President Clinton's judges were most similar to judges selected by President Ford. 
Republican members of the Senate thus cannot claim that they are safeguarding the judiciary from liberal jurists. Indeed, it is they who, in the words of Time magazine, are currently engaged in `what has become a more partisan and ideological examination of all judicial nominees.' As my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, stated last September, the `continuing attack on the judicial branch [by Republican Members of Congress], the slowdown in the processing of the scores of good women and men the President has nominated to fill vacancies on the Federal courts around the country, and widespread threats of impeachment [against federal judges] are all part of a partisan ideological effort to intimidate the judiciary.' 
Mr. President, Chief Justice Rehnquist has called the independence of the judiciary `the crown jewel of our system of government.' Our courts are revered around the globe precisely because of their ability to administer justice impartially and without regard to the prevailing political climate. Republicans in Congress are seeking to undermine judicial independence and freedom of action. A key element of their strategy has been to put a choke hold on the process of confirming nominees sent by President Clinton. This state of affairs must not be allowed to continue. As Chief Justice Rehnquist has stated, `The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or down.' Let the Senate heed the words of the Chief Justice and commit itself to enabling the federal judiciary to be, as the Supreme Court pediments proclaim, the guardian of our liberty and the guarantor of equal justice under the law.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, on February 27, 1998, the state of Illinois and our nation will lose a valuable public servant. After 23 years as the Director of the United States Small Business Administration's (SBA) Chicago District Office, John L. Smith is retiring. It is my honor to commend him on a distinguished career of service to our nation. 
Mr. Smith began a 47-year public service career in 1951 with a 4 year stint in the United States Navy. Following his discharge, Mr. Smith attended the Robert Morris School in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he received a degree in Business Administration. 
In 1967, Mr. Smith began working in the civil service with the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration where he worked as a loan specialist in several assignments throughout the East Coast. Prior to that, Mr. Smith had been the Director of Financial Assistance for the Business and Job Development Corporation in Pittsburgh. 
In 1973, Mr. Smith came to Chicago to serve as the Regional Administrator for the Commerce Department's Office of Minority Business Enterprise. In that position, Mr. Smith admirably directed activities in 10 states and managed over $5 million in grant and contract funds. 
In 1975, Mr. Smith began his long tenure as Director of the SBA's Chicago District Office. Over the past 23 years, he has managed the Chicago Office and a smaller branch office in Springfield. Additionally, he has been responsible for overseeing both offices' SBA loans, management assistance, government contracting, and advocacy programs for small businesses across Illinois. On his watch, small businesses in Illinois have received several billion dollars worth of loans and federal contracts. 
In addition to his professional successes, Mr. Smith and his wife have raised four adult children. John L. Smith has also worked to better his community and our nation through volunteering his time and abilities to organizations such as the American Heart Association, the Boy Scouts of America, the Kiwanis Club and the United Fund. 
Without a doubt, the citizens and the economy of the state of Illinois have benefitted greatly from John L. Smith's able and dedicated leadership. He leaves behind a strong and proud record of accomplishment at the Small Business Administration, as well as a remarkable career of government service. I wish him good luck and God's speed in all of his future endeavors.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, tonight the President of the United States will address the country in the State of the Union Address and much of the focus of that speech, we have been told, will be on the subject of education, something that I know the Presiding Officer has worked on over the years, and certainly I have worked on as my No. 1 priority since I came to the U.S. Senate. I am really pleased, however, that among the items in the area of education that the President will touch on is a particular item that I have labored long and hard on since I came to the Senate, and that is the issue of our crumbling schools. 
The President will tonight propose an initiative to rebuild our crumbling schools by making available support for local efforts to deal with the facilities and the infrastructure of their schools in the respective parts of the country. 
The centerpiece of the proposal that will be announced tonight is a plan to provide tax credits to help stimulate local school construction and modernization. The plan will help States and school districts address the enormous backlog of deferred maintenance to upgrade their schools to incorporate and accommodate modern technologies and to build new classrooms to accommodate soaring enrollment where appropriate. 
The plan--and I would like to talk specifically about it --will propose the creation of a new class of zero-interest bonds which can be used exclusively for school facilities and infrastructure development. Instead of receiving interest payments on these bonds, purchasers of the bonds will instead receive Federal income tax credits. 
This innovative plan will stimulate at least $22 billion--$22 billion--worth of school improvements over the next several years. Frankly, it is exactly the kind of new thinking and the kind of new partnership and innovative and creative financing that we will need to address the issue of our crumbling school infrastructure. 
I would like to take a moment to revisit how this issue came about. Coming out of State and local government, I was very concerned that we maintain, on the one hand, the values of local control of education, but at the same time find some way to relieve the pressure on the local property taxes that elementary and secondary education so often requires. 
Among the issues that seemed to me to be the most pressing 
and the most difficult for local districts to address was the question of school facilities. The buildings in which many of our children go to school are literally falling down around them. Most of these buildings have been built a generation ago when I was in school or the Presiding Officer was in school. Frankly, over time, these things just wear down. So you can see all over, certainly all over my State of Illinois and, indeed, all over the country, that our school facilities are crumbling right in front of us. Students talk about the fact that the windows are broken or the roof leaks or the lights--it even got to the point where Charles Schulz with the Peanuts cartoon did a series where Peppermint Patty is sitting in the classroom and raindrops are falling on her head. 
The point is, we can do better. So I commissioned a study by the General Accounting Office to look at the issue of crumbling schools. They went around and did a really exhaustive and highly acclaimed survey in which they documented $112 billion worth of deferred needs in terms of our school infrastructure; $112 billion required to rebuild the schools, to fix the plants, to provide our children with an environment that is suitable for learning. 
In addition to the aesthetics of it, that we want our kids to go to classrooms that are comfortable, consider for a moment that you cannot use a computer unless you plug it into the wall. If the electrical system is not there, then we will be denying our youngsters the opportunity to get trained, denying our work force the opportunity to be trained to compete in this global economy. It seems to me this is something of national importance and import and that it makes sense for the Federal Government to weigh in to help local districts meet the needs, the $112 billion worth of needs, all over the country. 
I started down this trail attempting to get a modest appropriation. I went in and got $600 million authorized and $100 million appropriated to this end. Then in the Congress of 1994, the $100 million that I had gotten appropriated for rebuilding the crumbling schools was taken back in the rescission package. So there was no money for it. 
We started the ball up the hill again, and the second time around, we were able to get the support of the White House and the Department of Education, and they proposed a $5 billion tax credit program to do this. That went up through committee and then eventually fell because of the lack of support last year. 
We have continued with this. Frankly, at every step of the way, even though we failed to actually get the full appropriation that we wanted, the public support built and built and built to the point that in the last session of the Congress, when we passed the Tax Relief Act, we were able in that bill to get some support for local districts going into the capital markets to borrow money. We changed the arbitrage rules a little bit. We raised the bond cap. So we were able to get some financial support but certainly not the $5 billion that we had hoped to get. 
Now the issue has gotten to the top of the pop charts, and polling data tells us again that 79 percent of the American people think there is an appropriate Federal role in rebuilding educational facilities. 
This proposal that the President will announce tonight will allow us to access about $22 billion--now, that is not the whole $112 billion--but $22 billion will help local districts repair their crumbling schools without having to increase property taxes. It seems to me that that is an absolutely appropriate role for us to take, given the national security interests, given the future of our work force, given the national stakes in all of this. If we can begin to have Federal support of elementary and secondary education in ways that preserve local control of education but allow us to contribute national resources to the enormous task that is before us, then we would have done our duty, frankly, by this next generation. 
So I am very pleased that the creative financing proposal that will be mentioned tonight represents a new direction, a new partnership. I believe firmly that the days when we can point fingers and say, `Well, it's the local taxpayers' fault that the schools are falling down,' or, `It's the State government's fault the schools are falling down,' or somebody else's fault, the days of fingerpointing are over. In fact, my mother used to say, when you point a finger, you always have three of them pointing back at yourself. 
If we can begin to have a new kind of partnership where States and local governments and the National Government work together to provide our children with the education that they need and the work force development that our country deserves, we will have discharged our responsibility to them and to the future of this Nation. 
We certainly have every opportunity with this proposal to go forward and pass this legislation. I am hopeful that we will do better this time around in achieving bipartisan support for the approach that says this is a new partnership; this new partnership will maintain local control and will give, if anything, local governments some financial support with regard to the challenge they face in rebuilding their crumbling schools. 
I am very excited about it, but having had two previous successes that were undone, I am not going to get overly excited until such time as the President actually signs the bill. But I am very encouraged, Mr. President, that the force of this idea has continued to support it and the force of this concept means, I think, that it is an idea whose time has come. That being the case, I feel very confident that, if not now, we will eventually pass legislation to rebuild our crumbling schools so that America's schoolchildren are given suitable environments in which they can learn. 
With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, on Sunday evening, the Senate completed its work on H.R. 2607, a bill providing appropriations for the District of Columbia for fiscal year 1998. 
I have serious concerns with several provisions of this bill--provisions which I, in good conscience, cannot support. 
Perhaps these problems could have been resolved had this bill been considered early and passed on time. There is a time to debate, however, and a time to act. This session of the 105th Congress is nearing a close, and that fact means that we must enact a D.C. funding bill--now. 
One of my concerns centers on a provision included in the bill that will grant permanent residence to almost 250,000 nationals of Central America and Eastern Europe. Those covered by the provisions, including Nicaraguans, Cubans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans, fled to the United States and sought haven during the civil wars in Central America in the 1980's. These individuals have been allowed to remain here temporarily under various Government immigration programs and court settlements. 
The 1996 Immigration Act, however, denied recourse to permanent residency for most of this class. This provision grants permanent residence to these nationals on a case-by-case basis if their return would pose unusual hardship. 
While I support this provision, I must once again state for the record my strong objections to the decision by the conferees to exclude approximately 18,000 Haitian refugees from this provision. This exclusion was not only patently unfair, but suggests almost a tin ear on the racial implications of this action. In the absence of a good reason for this exclusion, I can see no other justification for denying these individuals equal relief. I am certain that this is not the signal this body intended to send. 
I am heartened, however, that an agreement has been reached with the Justice Department that will allow 
these Haitians to remain in the country until this matter is resolved legislatively. I am also encouraged by the commitment made by congressional leadership to take up this issue during the next session of Congress. I encourage all of my colleagues to support legislation that I have cosponsored, along with Senators Graham, Mack, Abraham, and Kennedy that would resolve this issue. 
I am also troubled by a provision in this bill that would prohibit the District of Columbia from using local revenues to fund full reproductive health services for women. 
Clearly it is within the jurisdiction of Congress to restrict Federal funds for abortion services. That decision was upheld in 1980 by the Supreme Court in the Harris versus McRea decision. In that same ruling, however, the Court clearly asserted that decisions on abortion services for poor women, financed with State funds, were within the authority of the States. 
Unfortunately for the people of the District of Columbia the Court has provided no such protection. The people of this city, therefore, cannot make decisions regarding the use of locally raised revenue, for abortion services or any other purpose. 
The result is that the District is used as a guinea pig for Congress' social experiments. In this instance, opponents of full access to reproductive health services, including abortion, for poor women are furthering their agenda at the expense of democracy. 
Again, I would have liked to have these matters resolved before the vote, however, I am hopeful that we can rectify them in the next session.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I support S. 830, the conference report for the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997, and commend the conferees for quickly reaching agreement on compromises that will ultimately improve the FDA and improve the public's access to cutting edge medical technology. 
I am also pleased that we are going to pass this important legislation before adjourning for the year. The American people will be much better off as a result of our actions here today. S. 830 is a perfect example of Congress enacting public policy that Americans both want and need. 
There is no disagreement as to the caliber of the Food and Drug Administration. FDA is one of the finest regulatory agencies in the Nation and the world. However, the length of time and amount of paperwork required for FDA approval of new products may still be excessive. For many companies, particularly small and startup businesses, the FDA application process is a formidable time consuming obstacle. These barriers exist despite the recent agency improvements to their review process. In some cases, the length and complexity of the process can force companies to launch their products abroad rather than here in America. This is a troubling prospect, particularly given the increasingly competitiveness of global markets. 
The FDA, like all other entities, must evolve and adapt to the changing global landscape. Traditional methods of product review are no longer efficient. Industrialized and emerging nations now participate in multilateral trade agreements aimed to reduce trade barriers. While the U.S. continues as the world's premiere economy, our market dominance is dwindling. A recent Washington Post article indicated that our Nation was far more dominant economically following World War II, when the U.S. economy accounted for more than 25 percent of the world's output, than it is today. Evolving global markets hold untapped potential for product manufacturers. The ability to lucratively launch products abroad will bring pressure on the FDA to harmonize its regulatory policies with other international safety and performance standards. The traditional policies that have made the U.S. the `gold standard' in public health protection threaten to undermine our competitiveness. In order to maintain its status as the gold standard, the FDA must implement polices that encourage the launching of new products in this country, as opposed to Europe, and ensures that the United States maintains its technical and scientific leadership in health disciplines. 
Mr. President, S. 830 strikes a delicate balance between protecting the public health, fostering global trade under multilateral agreements, ensuring swift access to new health technology for Americans, and strengthening the U.S. technical and scientific leadership. 
The conference agreement reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) for an additional 5 years. PDUFA has been one of the most successful pieces of governmental reform legislation. During the 5 years since we first passed PDUFA, the average approval time for pharmaceutical products has dropped over 40 percent. The pharmaceutical and biologics industries overwhelming support reauthorization of PDUFA because they have seen tangible results from their fee payments. The American public also supports reauthorization of PDUFA because they have received access to innovative treatments in a more timely manner.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I strongly appose S. 1502, a bill to take funds away from public school children in order to subsidize private schools. 
Supporters of this legislation claim that the $7 million they propose to spend on private schools does not divert funds from public school children. The truth, however, is that in the zero-sum budget, any funds spent on vouchers must be drawn from other education funds. That means less resources for public school children. 
Seven million dollars could make a real difference in the DC public schools. We could fully fund after-school programs at every DC school. We could buy 368 new boilers for the DC schools. We could rewire the 65 schools that don't have electrical wiring to accommodate computers and multi-media equipment. We could upgrade the plumbing in the 102 schools with substandard facilities. With just $1 million, we could buy 66,000 new hard-cover books for DC's school libraries. There are real improvements we could make to the DC public school system with $7 million. Instead, this bill proposes to siphon those funds away from the public school children. 
Some of my colleagues suggest that, were it not for management problems, the DC schools would not be in the condition they are now in. How a diversion of $7 million from the public schools to private schools will solve that problem is beyond me. I have a better solution: good management. Paul Vallas has turned around the Chicago schools. It would not surprise me if some day the Chicago Public Schools were competing on the same level as the public schools that comprise the First in the World Consortium in north suburban Chicago. Students in those schools compete with students at the finest schools in the world. The DC schools have new management, and I have every confidence that General Becton will be able to do for the DC schools what Paul Vallas is doing for the Chicago schools. 
Some of my colleagues suggest that school vouchers will help improve the public schools by increasing competition--by creating, in effect, a marketplace for education. There is a problem with that proposal. By definition, markets have winners and losers, and our country cannot afford any losers in a game of educational roulette. 
Supporters of school vouchers state that this is not like a game of roulette, that research proves that voucher programs have positive effects on student achievement. The facts, however, do not speak so clearly to this issue. The data is mixed. Some studies show improvement. Some studies show declining achievement. Some studies show no difference at all between the students in public schools and those placed in private schools. We do know that programs in other countries have not succeeded. In France, Britain, the Netherlands, and Chile, voucher programs actually widened the achievement gap, instead of narrowing it. 
That is the real problem. Vouchers do not fix public schools. Vouchers do not solve problems. Vouchers raise false hopes in parents who desire better schools for their children. Vouchers are not answers to the real problems that we must address in our public schools. 
Mr. President, for the last three years, proponents of this bill in the Senate have failed to pass this bad idea. Today, however, in order to expedite the business of the Senate, I, and my colleagues who oppose this bill, are willing to the let the Senate pass this measure, because President Clinton has wisely pledged to veto it. Our willingness to let this legislation pass the Senate does not represent any weakening of our belief that it is fundamentally flawed, that it represents an abandonment of public education, and a pessimistic capitulation to a winnable challenge--the improvement of our public schools so they may serve all our children into the 21st century. 
We have agreed to let this legislation clear the Senate, in these last hours of the first session of the 105th Congress, as part of a much larger arrangement to consider a number of important issues, including: measures to fund the activities of the State Department, the Commerce Department, and the Justice Department; measures to fund the District of Columbia and our foreign aid operations; a stop-gap measure to fund our highway and mass transit programs; and legislation granting the President the so-called `fast track' authority to negotiate trade agreements. It is in this context, and with the advance knowledge that the President will veto this DC voucher bill, that we have agreed to let the Senate proceed with this bill. 
Mr. President, I hope that next year we will focus on real solutions to the problems facing our public schools. According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, 14 million children attend schools that are literally crumbling down around them, and we have let our public schools fall $112 billion into physical disrepair. Our children cannot learn the skills they need to keep us competitive in this kind of environment. I know that we can do better for our children. We can fix our schools, and I look forward to working with my colleagues next year on legislation to form a partnership with state and local governments to rebuild and modernize our crumbling schools. I look forward to working with my colleagues next year to address the real needs of our nation's 52 million public school children.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Mack, Kennedy, Abraham, and Graham in introducing the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1997. I believe that this legislation will help mend a current shortcoming in the law. 
During the early 1990's, our country flew in some 11,000 Haitians who fled the oppressive and dangerous conditions in their homeland during the overthrow of Haiti's democratically elected government. As you may know, this coup was marked by atrocious human rights abuses, including systematic use of rape and murder as weapons of terror. The International Civilian Mission, which has monitored human rights conditions throughout Haiti, documented this tragedy, including horrors so awful as to be almost imaginable. 
To allow such human rights violations to occur so close to home, while doing nothing would have been inconsistent with the stated goals of our foreign policy. So in 1991, the United States took in persons fleeing Haiti at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. After intense screening, many of these individuals were paroled into the United States to apply affirmatively for asylum. Between October, 1991 and May, 1992, over 30,000 Haitians were interviewed. Less than one-third of these individuals were paroled into the United States to seek asylum. 
For the past 6 years, these individuals have had pending asylum cases with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Now, despite the fact that these individuals have become a viable part of our Nation's communities, deportation of these Haitians has begun. The individuals that I am talking about today are the children, wives, brothers, and sisters of soldiers and activists who stood up for democracy in Haiti and suffered a great deal because of the strength of their convictions. They fled to this country for refuge. They played by our rules. In the time that they've been here, they've built homes, paid taxes, and raised families in our country. 
Two Presidential administrations have promised this class of people relief, and I believe that we have an obligation to make good on those promises. There is no excuse not to give them the relief similar to the relief that we have just recently granted to some 250,000 similarly situated Central American nationals. 
I believe that in order to be equitable and fair, we must grant similar relief to this small group of individuals. This bill grants that relief. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, and look forward to working with everyone to see that this issue is equitably resolved.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the one dollar coin bill is a part of this legislation. I have long been a supporter of legislation authorizing the production of a new dollar coin, and was an original cosponsor of the dollar coin bill, which became part of this coin legislation. 
Changing the currency or the coinage of the United States always involves an element of controversy. After all, virtually everyone uses money--every day. Americans are familiar with our currency and coinage, and they understandably and justifiably have opinions on whether to change it. There are a number of reasons, however, why this change is necessary. 
Unfortunately, today's dollar is not worth what it once was. In fact, the dollar's value has declined by over a factor of four in just the last 35 years. When I was a teenager, you could get a hamburger, fries and a small coke at McDonald's for 42 cents. Now the cost is over $2. You could get a Chicago Tribune and a Chicago Sun-Times for 10 cents. Now the Tribune costs 50 cents and the Sun-Times 35 cents. I could go on and on, but the point is simple--inflation has made the dollar worth less than a quarter was when John F. Kennedy was President of the United States. 
Perhaps the most telling illustration of the erosion of value of our currency and coinage is the fact that so many stores now have a `penny' dish in front of their cash registers--inviting their customers to take a penny or two or leave a penny or two to make their transactions come out to the nearest nickel. It is that kind of change in the value of money that led Great Britain to replace the one-pound note with a one-pound coin. And it is that fact that led Canada to replace its one-dollar bill with a one-dollar coin. 
These foreign countries, and many others, understood that they needed to update their currency and coinage to fit present-day economic realities--and that need is no less real in this country. That is why I cosponsored this legislation, because I believe that updating our money to reflect current economic realities is long overdue. I think we should act carefully. I think the coin must be designed carefully. We need to learn from past mistakes, but we should not let those past mistakes keep us from taking the action that is necessary now. 
Secondly, in many instances, a dollar coin would be more practical than a paper note. I'm sure we've all had a run-in with a balky dollar bill changer, one that simply won't take our dollar for a subway ride or a soft drink, no matter how many times we straighten the dollar. 
Finally, the use of a dollar coin would save money. For example, the Chicago Transit Authority would save over $2 million annually, because coins are easier and less expensive to process than bills. Many manufacturers that serve the vending industry and coin-operated industry would also save money because it is less expensive to retrofit machines to accept dollar coins, than to add a dollar bill changer to machines. 
However, the dollar coin we have currently, known as the `Susan B. Anthony,' lacks sufficient public acceptance to make it effective. This coin too closely resembles the quarter 
in appearance and texture. Moreover, according to the Mint, the supply of these coins is decreasing, and more would have to be minted within the next few years if the coin were not replaced. This legislation calls for the replacement of the Susan B. Anthony coin with a coin that is golden in color and smooth edged so that it is more easily differentiated from the quarter. 
The Susan B. Anthony coin is, unfortunately, the only American currency in circulation that honors the achievements of a woman. Since the Susan B. Anthony coin will no longer be widely circulated, it is only appropriate that the design of this new coin depict a woman or women of historical significance. To that end, I believe that the new coin should depict the images of Sojourner Truth, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott and Susan B. Anthony. These four women were staunch abolitionists, and fought for equal rights for women. It is largely through their efforts that women have opportunities for higher education, the right to control their own property and children, the right to hold public office and the right to vote. 
Three of these women, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Susan B. Anthony, have been honored with a statue in the Capitol. This statue, however, was carved in 1921, and failed to include Sojourner Truth, the great abolitionist, feminist and preacher. This coin provides an excellent opportunity to recognize the contributions of Sojourner Truth, along with her fellow women's rights advocates. 
Sojourner Truth was born into slavery in 1797 in New York State. Freed in 1827 under the New York State Emancipation Act, she spent the next 53 years preaching and lecturing about God, abolition and women's rights. 
Sojourner Truth was an advocate of women's rights. She consistently supported equality among all people. In 1851, Sojourner Truth spoke at a Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. Despite widely voiced concerns by many of the white women in attendance that they did not want an African American speaking, potentially confusing and tarnishing their cause, Sojourner Truth rose to respond to male preachers who were denouncing women's rights based on the inherent frailty of women: 
I want to say a few words about this matter. I am a woman's rights. I have as much muscle as any man and can do as much work as any man. I have plowed and reaped and husked and chopped and mowed, and can any man do more than that? I have heard much about the sexes being equal; I can carry as much as any man, and can eat as much, too, if I can get it. I am as strong as any man that is now . . . Why, children, if you have woman's rights, give it to her and you will feel better. You will have your own rights, and they won't be so much trouble . . . 
She inspired the Convention and women's rights advocates as she did all of her audiences. 
Sojourner Truth dedicated her life to achieving equality. She considered herself to be on a sojourn to tell the truth, a sojourn directed by God. It would be a fitting tribute to Sojourner Truth and to the truth which she preached, to honor her by depicting her image on the dollar coin, along with her fellow women's rights crusaders, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Susan B. Anthony. 
Along with a number of my colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee, I filed additional views with the committee report of this legislation, indicating our support for the four suffragettes. We also intend to make our views known to Secretary Rubin, who has the authority to select the design of the coin. I urge my colleagues to support this effort to ensure that the mistake made in 1921 is rectified and that Sojourner Truth can take her rightful place with the other suffragettes who fought for equal rights for all Americans.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I support the Promotion of Adoption, Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children [PASS] Act, as a commonsense approach to child welfare. Under the PASS Act, a State, for the first time, must make a child's health and safety the paramount consideration when making any decision regarding a foster care or adoption placement. 
It seems inconceivable that this is not currently the guiding principle behind every State's child welfare policy. The evolution of the child welfare system, however, has left a patchwork of goals and rules that can jeopardize a child's well being. 
The PASS Act will, for the first time, guarantee that every adopted child with special needs will receive needed health care coverage from the State. Previously, a child's eligibility for health care was tied to the ability of the birth parents to pay, even though the birth parents had given up all legal and economic ties to the child. There was no consideration given to the ability of the adoptive, permanent parents to afford health care for the child. 
Another example of the PASS Act's commonsense approach is the requirement that States provide for criminal records and child abuse registry checks of any prospective foster or adoptive parents, noncustodial adults living in a foster or adoptive home, and employees of child care institutions. Choosing a safe and supportive home for a child is not a simple task, but ensuring that the child is not placed with someone convicted of a serious crime or child abuse must be a basic requirement. This is not required under current law. 
There are a number of other important provisions in this bill, including the reauthorization of the family preservation and family support program to strengthen families, and a system of rewards for States that increase adoption placements. Taken as a whole, this bill is an important step forward in our efforts to improve child health and safety. 
The sponsors of this bill have worked diligently to forge bipartisan compromise on this legislation. I commend them for their efforts and their success. 
As with all compromise legislation, there are provisions in the PASS Act with which I do not necessarily agree. I am concerned that insufficient efforts will be made to keep sound families together, that the allowance of child welfare waivers will lead to inadequate Federal oversight of child welfare in the States, and that funding must be increased in order to achieve a permanent solution to the problems plaguing our child welfare system. 
While it is politically popular to withdraw Federal support and oversight for programs and turn power over to the States, I firmly believe that we cannot abandon our Federal role in providing for the welfare of the Nation's children. Whether we are talking about providing access to early childhood education, repairing the Nation's crumbling schools, or guaranteeing the health and safety of children in our foster care and adoption system, the Federal Government must continue to assist and oversee State efforts. 
In the end, no child's welfare should be dependent on the generosity or failure of the foster care and adoption program in the State in which he or she was born. Commonsense requires that we continue to marshal the Nation's resources to provide for the next generation of Americans. 
The PASS Act is an opportunity for Congress to assist States in providing for those of America's children in need of foster care or adoption. By ensuring that the health and safety of the child are paramount, this legislation puts us on the track to making the foster care and adoption system work for the children it is meant to serve. I thank my colleagues for their efforts and for their commitment to common sense, and urge the Senate to approve the PASS Act.

With regard to the majority leader's request for rolling all the remaining appropriations bills into one vehicle, as the majority leader may be aware, I had not wanted to object, but I reserve my right to object with regard to the immigration issue pertaining to Haitians. The D.C. appropriations bill provides for special status or relief for Guatemalans, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans and Cubans and leaves out the Haitians. 
Certainly, I cannot imagine that is a result we would want to see, and I urge the majority leader and other negotiators to see that that real injustice is corrected as they discuss the final package for that legislation. 
Again, I, just like everyone else in this Chamber, would love to have this go out on a unanimous rollcall vote or unanimous voice vote, but at the same time the gravity of the injustice in that situation is just so profound I would have to lodge an objection if that does not get done.

It is my understanding that under this legislation a taxpayer who had gone through an audit or set of investigations or prosecutions, that came out on the other end of the process absolved of any error of even wrongdoing, that that taxpayer would be able to, at least, recoup not all but some of the expenses associated with defending the integrity of their voluntary compliance with the Tax Code.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Is it the Senator's impression that, along with putting some real teeth into taxpayer rights, that this legislation provides--and, again, we could do more in other legislation--but this legislation puts real teeth in taxpayer rights, and that it might also have a beneficial effect in terms of the culture or the climate of the IRS? 
For example, we heard in the hearings that they had quotas. They were not official quotas but unofficial quotas. That this might affect the culture in the way that the IRS viewed its mission and viewed its responsibility to taxpayers. Is it the Senator's impression that this legislation will help move that culture in the direction of a service that is more understanding of its obligations and responsibilities to the American people?

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I stand before you today in support of Senator Bob Kerrey's request to pass IRS reform legislation before Congress begins recess. 
I along with all of the Senate Democrats have signed onto a letter urging Senator Lott to bring up legislation to reform the IRS this year. I support IRS reform and believe that there should be no further delay in beginning the process of change. I am a cosponsor of S. 1096, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1997, and believe that the Senate should act on the House-passed version H.R. 2676. There are 35 Members of the Senate that are cosponsors of this bill and of those, 14 Members are on the Senate Finance Committee. 
The House of Representatives has already acted on November 5, 1997, by a vote of 425 to 4 to overwhelmingly pass H.R. 2676, the legislation that would overhaul the way the IRS operates. We should too. 
It has been 40 years since Congress and the President have considered significant reforms to the Internal Revenue Service. With this bill, there is a historic opportunity to overhaul the IRS and transform it into an efficient, modern, and responsive agency. The IRS interacts with more citizens than any other Government agency or private sector business in America and collects 95 percent of the revenue needed to fund the Federal Government. Congress and the President owe it to the American public to seize this opportunity and pass this legislation as soon as possible.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today's economic reality is that trade is global. Whether we enter into new international trade agreements or not, we cannot turn back the clock on the pace of globalization of our economy. 
Nor should we want to. In open and free trade lies the potential of increased trade, and with increased trade and constructive interaction among the peoples of the world, the prospect of job creation, and an improved standard of living worldwide is created. 
Americans, who have enjoyed the highest standard of living in the world, need not fear our ability to compete and win in this new global economy. To the contrary, we have every interest in preparing ourselves to meet and master the challenges of this new era. 
Economic growth through trade can produce better jobs, increased prosperity, and a continuation of the high standard of living and opportunity that define the American dream. In the last 4 years, exports have accounted for one out of every three jobs created in the U.S. economy. Moreover, the strength of our economy is reflected in the fact that the United States is the No. 1 exporting nation in the world. 
Our trade competitors, in recognition of the trends already evident in this new global economy, have formed regional trading alliances and relations to meet U.S. competition in world markets. Europe is beginning to trade as a European Community; an agreement among the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, known as ASEAN, augments Asian competition; and the United States entered into the NAFTA, in order to begin the formation of a regional trading arrangement in our hemisphere. 
I believe that trade liberalization can have positive effects for our American economy. I do not believe, however, that it is advisable at this time to resort to the fast-track procedure to get there. 
At the outset, I want to remind my colleagues and the public at large that what is at issue with this debate is not whether we will embrace trade liberalization, but how we will do so, and under what conditions. For constitutional, policy, and practical reasons I cannot support S. 1269, given the current lack of consensus in this Congress on trade policy objectives. I believe that this legislative proposal, as currently constituted, leaves too many questions unanswered regarding the balance that needs to be struck in the interest of American business and the American people. 
Section 8 of article 1 of the Constitution gives to Congress the commercial power: `Congress shall have the power to . . . regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, . . . and to lay and collect duties, imports and excises' The Framers of the Constitution very clearly made it our responsibility to make commercial agreements, to set tariff levels, and to pass the laws necessary to implement legislation for trade agreements that are not self-executing. This power was put into the hands of the Congress, after no small amount of debate, as a check and balance on the President's authority to make treaties and to conduct foreign policy. 
The concept of checks and balances lies at the heart of our constitutional system of government. The separation of powers, and the checks and balances it provides, was, and is, a defense against the tyranny that concentration of power invites. In fact, some of the Framers of the Constitution argued that the powers vested in one branch of the Government could only be exercised by that branch. In 1789, James Madison proposed an amendment to our Constitution which explicitly stated as much: `the legislative, executive and judiciary powers vested by the Constitution in the respective branches of the government of the United States shall be exercised according to the distribution therein made, so that neither of said branches shall assume or exercise any of the powers peculiar to either of the other branches.' (The House adopted Madison's proposed amendment, while the Senate, for reasons lost to history, rejected it.) 
While it is still a matter of scholarly debate to what extent the separation of powers exists as a doctrine or as a concept within our Constitution, the fact that we are engaging in this debate at all is witness to the fact that this bill calls upon the legislature to transfer a good part of its constitutional authority, in regards to commercial treaties, to the Executive. 
That is not to suggest that the fast-track authority has been a failure, or that the Executive should never be entrusted to assume such authority as the Constitution makes our responsibility. An early Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin, speaking to those instances in which `shared' authority might be appropriate, noted that, `it is evident that where the Constitution has lodged the power, there exists the right of acting, and the right of direction'. . . . but he went on to address the accommodation that might be appropriate between the branches of government in this regard: `the opinion of the executive, and where he has a partial power, the application of that power to a certain object will ever operate as a powerful motive upon our deliberations. I wish it to have its full weight, but I feel averse to a doctrine which would place us under the sole control of a single force impelling us in a certain direction, to the exclusion of all the other motives of action which should also influence us.' (Gallatin, 7 Annals of Congress 1121-22 (1798)) 
The bill before us would effectively preclude the Congress from informing the Executive of `all the other motivations of action,' and even limits the time for debate. No amendments to trade agreements negotiated under the fast-track authority are permitted, and only 20 hours of debate are allowed. Given the momentous changes which are taking place in this new and global economy, this restriction on congressional input seems to me unwise and unnecessary, and should not be allowed to become routine practice. 
Part of the lingering bitterness over the NAFTA, I suspect, arises from the fact that it was presented to the Congress under the same kind of fast-track procedures as are at issue now. Now, it is true that the claims on both sides of that debate, of a great `sucking sound' on the one hand, or of unprecedented job 
creation, on the other, did not materialize. What we have seen, in fact, is a mix of results, some better than predicted, some very much worse, but none fully realized, or more importantly, shared with the American people. 
My home State of Illinois, for example, is a great exporting State, the fifth largest in our country; 425,000 Illinois jobs are directly related to exports, and Illinois manufacturing exports have grown by 53 percent since 1993. Illinois' agricultural sector has also benefited from increased exports of corn and soybeans. 
On the other hand, the losses of manufacturing jobs have been significant enough to give more credence than I would have liked to the dire predictions of the debate over NAFTA. Other States have had different experiences, and one need only reflect on the impact on wheat imports, for example, to conclude that we have yet to reach closure on the long term effects that increased liberalization will create. 
And yet, despite that history and despite the absence of a clear trade policy architecture that can command broad support both in Congress and across our Nation generally, S. 1269 would again mute the voice of the Congress concerning the architecture and objectives of our trade policy. Without the ability to amend such agreements as may be reached in the future, or to even enjoy normal parliamentary rights, we are left to that `sole control of a single force impelling us in a certain direction,' which Mr. Gallatin feared. 
We need a trade policy framework that will represent the interests of all of the American people, and that will best advantage our business sector in its global competitive challenge. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of our President and his first rate economic and trade team, we do not yet have such a framework. 
I am particularly concerned about the issue of child labor. American business cannot compete fairly with nations that allow labor costs to be artificially depressed by the exploitation of children. In 1994, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a startling report entitled `By the Sweat and Toil of Children--the Use of Child Labor in U.S. Manufactured and Mined Imports.' That report found that in textiles manufacturing, food processing, furniture making, and a host of other export-directed activities, children are employed for long hours in abysmal conditions, and are paid very low wages. They have few, if any legal rights, can be fired without recourse, and are often abused. They are hired by our foreign competitors to minimize labor costs. The International Labor Organization reports that 25 million children, world wide, are so engaged. 
In the Philippines, for example, the Labor Department Report stated that in the wood and rattan furniture industry, children working in factories received 15 to 25 pesos per day--approximately 61 cents to $1. About 29 percent of the children were unpaid or compensated with free food; the rest were paid on a piece rate basis. About 48 percent of the children work between 15 to 25 hours a week, while another 13 percent work more than 50 hours for less than minimum wage. 
The report stated that children who work in the garment industry in Thailand work 12-hour days in shops where they earn as little as five cents for sewing 100 buttons. Furthermore, they reported that in Cairo in Egypt's small family-operated textile factories, 25 percent of the workers were under the age of 15. Seventy-three percent of the children worked in excess of 12 hours per day and earned an average of $8 per month. 
These are just a few examples of countries that employ children. Clearly, it is in the interest of every modern business and every industrialized nation to develop new international standards to help end child labor. Lower wages and extremely poor working conditions can lower manufacturers' costs in the short term, but they create long-term economic and geopolitical problems, not just for the country that exploits its children, but for the United States, as well. 
When foreign industries artificially depress their labor costs by exploiting children, how can a U.S. worker compete? We must level the playing field for American workers. And more importantly, we must put our Nation on record that child labor must end. The United States must realize that it is an enlightened business policy to eliminate abusive child labor. Free-trade agreements should contain clear provisions against the use of abusive child labor. 
Child labor should be designated an unfair trade practice, but S. 1269 does not make it so. Without such minimal ground rules with respect to child labor, our trade policy will be at cross purposes with our trade and larger foreign policy and national security objectives. We will have created a two-tier system in which U.S. companies will be prohibited from exploiting children here at home, while foreign firms, and U.S. companies, which leave to take advantage of the lower labor costs on foreign soil, will be permitted to exploit children so they can gain competitive advantage over those who play by our domestic rules. Such a system does nothing to benefit American business, creates incentives for the loss of U.S. jobs, and leaves us all with the shame of complicity in child abuse. 
Finally, it is important to note that the Executive has the ability and the authority to negotiate trade agreements even in the absence of the fast-track procedure. It is my understanding that some 200 trade agreements have been concluded without it. Fast-track has only been used five times since 1974, for the GATT Tokyo round in 1979, the United States-Israel Free-Trade Area Agreement in 1985, the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement in 1988, NAFTA in 1992, and the Uruguay round of the GATT in 1994. 
Instead of closing off debate about the proper purposes and architecture of free trade, we ought to encourage open and full debate with the American people about it. Trade is inevitably a more and more important aspect of our economic landscape, and indeed, as American business achieves the kind of market access in the world community that its capacity will allow, more and more U.S. workers will see the benefits of liberalization. Even today, those businesses which have benefited from the increased access accorded by NAFTA and GATT are enthusiastic about the prospects for real economic growth from this sector. We should be optimistic about our prospects overall, because American goods and services are seen by the rest of the world as providing the excellence they want. But we will see only fractiousness and retreat, if we fail to achieve consensus about the rules of our foray into this global economic competition. 
I have a sense that trade, and its impacts, not only on our economy, but on our foreign policy as well, will come more and more to dominate the debate in our country about our future course and direction. If we are to be mindful of the ancient warning that `all wars start with trade' then we should redouble our resolve to make certain that our policy is based on consensus among our people regarding its direction, its objectives, its ground rules. We do not have such consensus yet. We should not shut off the debate which is the only way to get that consensus.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to extend certain trade benefits to fine jewelry produced in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. 
Under current law, additional U.S. Note 5 to Chapter 91 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule provides limited duty-free treatment and duty refunds to certain watches and watch movements produced in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. The bill I am introducing today would also make certain articles of fine jewelry produced in these insular possessions, eligible for certain note 5 benefits, thereby significantly expanding economic opportunities for insular possession manufacturers and their workers. At the same time, this bill expressly provides that the extension of note 5 benefits to jewelry may not result in any increase in the authorized amount of benefits established by note 5. 
This legislation will promote needed employment and economic development in the U.S. insular possessions, particularly the U.S. Virgin Islands, by providing insular possession manufacturers with greater flexibility in the use of certain existing trade benefits. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the bill be placed in the Record.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the School Repair and Construction Act of 1997. This bill would help States and school districts rebuild our crumbling schools by providing tax credits to developers and builders who build new schools or renovate crumbling schools at below-market rates. 
Under this proposal, the Treasury would allocate pools of tax credits to States. States would allocate the credits to school districts. School districts would be able to give these tax credits to developers and builders to cover a portion of the cost of their school repair, renovation, modernization, and construction projects. By allocating tax credits in this manner, the bill would reduce the cost to school districts of school improvement projects by up to 30 percent. 
The School Repair and Construction Act of 1997 creates a mechanism for paying for this proposal that is contingent upon our future economic prosperity. If actual revenue into the Federal Treasury exceeds the revenue projections, a portion of those excess revenues would be deposited in a School Infrastructure Improvement Trust Fund. The money in this Trust Fund--up to $1 billion per year--would be available for disbursement to States in the form of the allocable tax credits. 
Earlier this year, the Congress enacted broad tax legislation designed to generate wealth and spur economic growth and prosperity. If we are right and that promise comes true, our children ought to benefit from our prosperity. The legislation I am introducing today will guarantee that these revenues are used to rebuild and modernize our schools so they can serve all our children into the 21st century. 
According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, 14 million children attend schools in such poor condition they need major renovations or should be replaced outright; 12 million children attend schools with leaky roofs; and 7 million children attend schools with life-threatening safety-code violations. These conditions exist in every type of American community. Thirty-eight percent of urban schools, 30 percent of rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools are falling down around our children. According to the GAO, it will cost $112 billion just to bring schools up to good, overall condition. 
The $112 billion price tag does not include the cost of upgrading schools for technology, the cost of upgrading electrical systems and installing outlets in classrooms that were built decades ago. The FCC recently issued a landmark ruling that will give millions of children access to modern computer and communications technology. Too many children, however, will be unable to take advantage of this opportunity, because their schools lack the basic infrastructure necessary to allow their teachers to plug computers into the classroom walls. According to the GAO, 15 million children attend schools that lack enough electrical power to fully use computers and communications technology. Almost 50 percent of schools lack the necessary electrical wiring to deploy computers to classrooms. 
In addition, public high school enrollment is expected to increase 15 percent by the year 2007. Just to maintain current class sizes, we will need to build 6,000 new schools by the year 2007. 
I have visited schools in Illinois where study halls are literally held in hallways because of a lack of space. I have seen stairway landings converted into computer labs. There is a school where the lunchroom has been converted into two classrooms, students eat in the gym, and instead of gym class, many children have what the school calls adaptive physical education, while they stand next to their desks. 
These overcrowded and dilapidated conditions are no accident. They are predictable results of the way we fund education. As long as we continue to rely on the local property tax to fund school infrastructure improvements, the conditions of schools will not improve. 
The local property tax is simply an inadequate way of paying for school infrastructure improvements. According to the GAO, poor- and middle-class school districts try the hardest to raise revenue, but the system works against them. In 35 States, poor districts have higher tax rates than wealthy districts--but raise less revenue because there is less property wealth to tax. 
These districts cannot rely on State support. The GAO found that in fiscal year 1994, State governments only contributed $3.5 billion to the school infrastructure crisis--barely 3 percent of the total need. 
This local funding model does not work for school infrastructure, just as it would not work for highways or other infrastructure. Imagine what would happen if we based our system of roads on this same funding model. Imagine if every community were responsible for the construction and maintenance of the roads within its borders. In all likelihood, there would be smooth, good roads in the wealthy towns, a patchwork of mediocre roads in middle-income ones, and very few roads at all in poor communities. Transportation would be hostage to the vagaries of wealth and geography. Commerce and travel would be difficult, and navigation of such a system would not serve the interests of the whole country. That hypothetical, unfortunately, precisely describes our school funding system. 
The time has come for us to heed the call of superintendents, parents, teachers, architects, mayors, governors, contractors, and children from around the country and create a partnership to fix our Nation's crumbling schools. 
Winston Churchill once said, `We shape our buildings; thereafter, they shape us.' No where is that more true than in schools. The poor condition of America's schools has a direct affect on the ability of our students to learn the kinds of skills they will need to compete in the 21st century, global economy. America can't compete if our students can't learn, and our students can't learn if their schools are crumbling down around them. 
This School Repair and Construction Act of 1997 is a sensible way of helping States and school districts meet their school repair, renovation, modernization and construction needs. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this important legislation.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I rise to state my objection to the motion to proceed on the District of Columbia appropriations bill, at least temporarily. I want to explain why. 
There is currently an amendment on the D.C. appropriations bill that will grant certain Central Americans access to the suspension of deportation procedure. These are refugees--people who leave their countries for political asylum here. And they will not be deported because of the amendment that is part of the D.C. appropriations bill. It covers some 191,000 Salvadorans, some 21,000 Nicaraguans, some 118,000 Guatemalans, and I certainly support the suspension of deportation for all of those groups of asylum seekers. It does not, however, cover just about 18,000 Haitians. In fact, the only group of asylum seekers that were left out of the bill as it came out of the House were the Haitians. 
This is not only patently unfair but certainly suggests almost a tin ear on the racial implications of what came out of the House by the House Members who put this together that they would not understand--that singling out the Haitians for exclusion from this relief would be perceived as negative in many parts of this country which is nothing short of stunning to me. 
I am happy to report that I had a conversation with the majority leader, Senator Lott. He wants to try to help us with this situation. Senator Graham has an actual bill to try to fix the situation with regard to the Haitians separate and apart from the District of Columbia appropriations. I support and would cosponsor Senator Graham's legislation. However, the catch here and the reason for my voicing my objection right now--my temporary objection right now--is that, as Senator Lott pointed out in his comments, we talk about whether or not these Haitians would be deported in the meantime until Senator Graham's bill can get passed. We don't yet have an agreement from the administration, from the INS, from the House, from the Senate in terms of Senate oversight. We don't have an agreement that these Haitians won't be singled out--18,000 out of almost 250,000 people to be deported in the interim until the Graham effort is concluded. 
So I find myself in the difficult position of having to object to proceeding to something that might otherwise be a good thing until this obvious blatant error is--at least until we get some commitments that these people will not be harmed. That is what the number of men, women, and children need for their lives in behalf of and in pursuit of democracy. It is not fair to single them out for special treatment for no rational reason other than as they have brought to me that they fear they have been singled out because of their color, that they have been singled out because of their race. 
That is not right. That is not what this country stands for. I hope that is not the signal that we are going to send by the way this legislative process works out. 
So, until we get an agreement on suspension of deportation, I am afraid I will have to object to the motion to proceed with regard to the District of Columbia appropriations bill. I know there are some other issues. I hope these issues get worked out. I hope this issue gets worked out. 
I want to put the Senate on notice that this legislation in its current form sends the absolute wrong signal to the country and, indeed, to the world regarding our commitment to family. 
How are you going to suspend deportation for 191,000 people from El Salvador, 21,000 people from Nicaragua, 118,000 people from Guatemala and not allow 18,000 people from Haiti to take advantage of the same relief under almost identical circumstances? There is no reason for it. There is no rational for it. Quite frankly, I would be remiss if I allowed this mistake to go forward. I am confident it is going to be worked out. 
Again, my conversation with Senator Lott, my conversation with Senator Graham, with Senator Kennedy, and with Senator Mack--we have had conversations across the board. We just want to make certain there is agreement before this starts to leave here--that there is a agreement that these people will not be kicked out of country under circumstances in which almost 250,000 people similarly situated are allowed to stay. That is my objection. That is my problem with the bill at the time. 
I want to make the point that we in the Senate are not prepared to send that kind of negative signal to the country or to the rest of the world, and that we will at least resolve the deportation issue before the District of Columbia appropriations legislation goes forward. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today, Senator Shelby and several of my other colleagues on the Banking Committee are introducing the Financial Regulatory Relief and Economic Efficiency Act of 1997. I am cosponsoring this legislation because I have long been committed to the process of reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens on financial institutions. Many of the provisions were drafted in consultation with the banking regulatory agencies and will remove duplicative, unnecessary restrictions that no longer make sense and are no longer appropriate, given this era of great change in the financial services industry. This bill will allow the banks to be more efficient and cost-effective in their activities. It will also allow them to better meet the needs of the users of the system, the individuals, the communities, the businesses, the exporters, the farmers, and all those who depend on our financial system. We live in capital-scarce times and that means that it is imperative that our financial system provides capital to those who need it in the most cost-effective manner possible. We can be longer tolerate inefficiencies due to outmoded regulation. 
However, it is important to note that I do not support every provision of this bill, and in fact I have serious concerns about portions of it. I believe that certain sections of the bill will need to be changed significantly as it works its way through the Banking Committee and the Senate floor. That said, I want to be a part of this process, because I believe in the objectives of the bill: reducing unnecessary regulatory burden. Furthermore, I think the issue should be addressed in a bipartisan manner. This type of effort needs to be a priority for Banking Committee and the Senate as a whole, and that is why I am an original cosponsor of the Financial Regulatory Relief and Economic Efficiency Act of 1997.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, several months ago, during the debate on the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, some of my colleagues called upon Congress to end its commitment to ethanol. 
Ethanol, as my colleagues are aware, is an alcohol-based motor fuel manufactured from corn. 
These lawmakers, predominately from oil States, drew their daggers in professed horror, branding Federal support for ethanol as a `deficit buster,' or a conspiracy of `corporate welfare.' 
While I know this mantra has become popular and convenient for many in Congress in recent years, the truth is that, in this instance, it is simply false. I would like to urge my colleagues to examine an excellent essay recently printed in the Wall Street Journal which illustrates the truth about ethanol, and which, I am hopeful, will convince critics to reconsider their position. 
The article, entitled `Alcohol and Driving Can Mix,' and authored by former Central Intelligence Agency Director James Woolsey, outlines the environmental and energy benefits of replacing gasoline with alcohol fuels, like ethanol. 
Mr. President, the concept of alcohol-based fuels is not new. Fifty years ago, an Illinois lawmaker named Everett Dirksen encouraged policymakers to consider `processing our surplus farm crops into an alcohol of 10 percent.' In doing so, Dirksen believed, we would `create a market in our own land for our own people.' 
Half a century later, this idea has become reality. Today, demand for ethanol is estimated at 1.5 billion gallons. There are approximately 50 commercial facilities producing fuel ethanol in more than 20 different States across the country. By 2005, 640 million bushels of corn will be used to produce 1.6 billion gallons of ethanol. 
Ethanol has a wide range of benefits, such as its effects on the environment. Ethanol burns more cleanly than gasoline, and, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, diminishes dangerous fossil-based fumes, like carbon monoxide and sulfur, that choke our congested urban areas. 
Oil tankers will not spill ethanol into our oceans, killing wildlife. National parks and refuges will not be targets for exploratory drilling. When ethanol supplies run low, you simply grow more corn. 
Ethanol also strengthens national security. Ethanol flows not from oil wells in the Middle East, but from grain elevators in the Middle West, using American farmers, and creating American jobs. With each acre of corn, 10 barrels of foreign oil are displaced--up to 70,000 barrels each day. 
And for farmers, ethanol creates value-added markets, creating new jobs and boosting rural economic development. According to a recent study conducted by Northwestern University, the 1997 demand for ethanol is expected to create 195,000 new jobs nationwide. 
The bottom line is that ethanol is the fuel of the future--and the future is here. Illinois drivers consume almost 5 billion gallons of gasoline, one-third of which is blended with ethanol. Chicago automotive plants are assembling a new Ford Taurus that runs on 85 percent ethanol. More and more gas stations are offering ethanol as a choice at the pump. 
Isn't it worth cultivating an industry that improves the environment and promotes energy independence? Isn't it the responsibility of Congress to foster an economic climate that creates jobs and strengthens domestic industry? Don't we have a commitment to rural America, and a responsibility for its economic future? 
Mr. President, I think the answer to these questions is a resounding yes, and that's why I will work to ensure that the Federal commitment to ethanol is kept.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, earlier this year, I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Bill Lee, President Clinton's nominee for the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. I was impressed with his intelligence, his strong sense of fairness, and his dedication to ensuring that all Americans have the opportunity to enjoy the same basic rights. Today I strongly urge my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee to act favorably on the nomination of Bill Lan Lee. 
Mr. Lee has an exceptional background. He is a graduate of Yale University and Columbia University Law School, and has proven his dedication to the pubic sector by working for the Asian American Legal Defense Fund and the Los Angeles-based Center for Law in the Public Interest. Currently, he serves as western regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. During his 23-years as a civil rights litigator, Mr. Lee has earned a reputation for his legal expertise and his integrity. 
In July, the President nominated Mr. Lee to be the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice. At the time of his nomination, Mr. Lee was widely praised by both his allies and adversaries as a qualified and competent civil rights attorney, and was supported by both Democrats and Republicans. No one questioned his intelligence nor his qualifications to competently serve this country as the Assistant Attorney General. 
That is why it is so surprising, in the eleventh hour, to now hear so much opposition to this nomination. The vote on this nomination should be based on Mr. Lee's competence, ability, and character. Instead, some Senators have decided that his nomination should be held hostage to their position on affirmative action. Rather that to fill this position, which has gone vacant for over six months, my colleagues instead have chosen to push their political agenda. I do not believe that this is at all appropriate, nor do I believe that this action is in the best interests of the American people. 
I must point out that this is not a lifetime position, nor is it a regulatory position that will out last the President's term. Rather, this position carries a term that is served at the whim of the President. It seems to me that the President, who was elected by the people, should have the right to choose those who will serve under him, that he should have the option of choosing individuals whose personal views reflect his own, so long as those individuals have the requisite competence, ability, and character. But the opposition to Mr. Lee is not based on his abilities, rather, it is based on policy. I do not believe that this is a legitimate reasoning for opposing this particular nomination. 
I am especially troubled by this attack on Mr. Lee because I believe it does an injustice to the American dream. The American dream is a major part of what makes this country such a special place. It says that everyone--whether rich or poor, male or female, gay or straight, black or white--everyone should have the opportunity to go as far as their talent and hard work will take them. It's a dream that says that merit, and nothing more, should determine your opportunities. 
Mr. Lee is a shining example of this dream becoming reality. Out of adversity came this bright, enthusiastic gentleman who made a career of ensuring that everyone has equal opportunities to share their talents and succeed. In fact, it was this belief in this idealistic view of America that made Mr. Lee pursue this position. Lee insisted in his confirmation hearing that as `a son of immigrants, the opportunity to serve the nation by enforcing the Federal civil rights laws reaffirms [his] belief in the American dream.' 
Despite this statement, and despite the fact that Mr. Lee has repeatedly assured his critics that he is not in favor of quotas, that he believes every talented and able individual should be given the full opportunity to compete and succeed, and that he would enforce the laws of our country, my colleagues continue to take issue with his nomination by attacking his personal beliefs and views on affirmative action. Unfortunately, these baseless allegations, unfounded attacks, and unwarranted comments about Mr. Lee have undermined the first real chance this Senate has had to fill this position with a qualified and competent individual. In short, they are refusing to give this qualified individual the opportunity to stand on his merit. 
Mr. President, I thank the American people deserve better, and I believe we do an injustice to them by allowing this position to go empty for this long for no good reason. This is shameful, and I urge my colleagues to reconsider their actions.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I join Senator Moynihan in his objection to this legislation on procedural grounds. As a member of that committee, I can attest to the fact that we have had no hearings at all on this legislation. The issue has not come up in committee. In fact, as far as I know, there is no precedence for bringing a House-passed tax bill to the Senate floor without any committee consideration whatsoever, without a single hearing or markup, and then immediately subjecting that matter to a vote to close off debate. 
That is what this is about. If cloture is invoked, it would limit the ability of Senators, those on the Finance Committee and everybody else, for that matter, to offer amendments. Members of the Finance Committee, Members of this body have not had an opportunity to offer amendments, have not had an opportunity to debate this matter, and this vote effectively will shut off that debate. 
I have filed two amendments to this tax bill, both relating to the issue of school repair and construction. Our buildings, as many parents know, are literally falling down around our children. They certainly cannot learn in those kinds of environments. 
I know of other amendments that have been filed relating to a variety of issues touching on this legislation--all amendments relevant to the consideration of this tax bill--but, again, those Senators who have offered those amendments will not have the opportunity to offer their amendments if cloture is invoked. 
Mr. President, I think those reasons should be enough for every Member of this body to vote against cloture, because, if nothing else, this is supposed to be a deliberative body, and we are supposed to have the opportunity to talk about ideas, to really fully explore them, to talk about them in a public way so that the people who listen to these debates have a chance to know what it is that we are voting on. But this bill has not had that. In fact, what it sets up is another set of tax expenditures without any consideration of the implications or the impacts of that expenditure. 
To use the term `tax expenditure'--for the average citizen, the words `tax expenditure' do not have a lot of resonance, do not have a lot of meaning. 
I want you to think about, for a moment, spending from two perspectives: Spending out of the front door and spending out of the backdoor. 
Front-door spending includes appropriations, and everybody can relate to those. You see it on a bill. Bills that we pass, they say: We are going to spend this much for that purpose or this much for that purpose. The appropriations spending, front-door spending, is obvious. It is apparent. The public can understand it. It is simple. Everybody knows what the deal is, whether it is spending for a bridge or somebody's boondoggle. Appropriations for front-door spending is apparent and obvious spending. 
This plan we are considering today goes in the other direction, of the nonobvious spending for what is called tax expenditures. We can debate tax expenditures for a while, but the point is, I call it backdoor spending because essentially what it is is it is spending that takes place when you carve out an exception for somebody who otherwise was paying taxes, where you say everybody has to pay taxes, but as to this little group here, taxes will not have to be paid. So that then means that everybody else who is left has to make up that little hole that is created. That is what we mean by loopholes. That is what we mean by tax expenditures. And this is such a tax expenditure. This is not only a tax expenditure, it is $4 billion tax expenditure. 
I would have thought at a minimum we would have had a chance to have this up in committee and have had to have witnesses testify on it and to have at least amendments on this floor. None of that 
has been made available with regard to this bill. 
There are times, Mr. President, when tax expenditures really do make sense, where we take the position that it makes more sense to say, as to this universe of people, this little group should not have to pay taxes, this loophole serves a legitimate function and it is an efficient way to do or to effect whatever policy it is that we are trying to achieve. There are some times when it is efficient. 
So for a moment, for purposes of this debate, let us take a look at the efficiency of this tax expenditure, whether or not the taxpayers who are going to have to make up this $4 billion difference, whether or not they will get the bang for their buck, whether or not it makes sense for us to spend money through the back door in this way. 
The truth is that this plan will benefit only the wealthy. According to the Treasury Department, which has analyzed this proposed tax scheme and calculated what are called its distributional effects--that is to say, who gets the benefit of the tax benefit; what kind of bang for the buck do you get for this spending out of the back door?--70 percent of the benefits in this proposal would go to the top 20 percent of the income scale, that is to say, families with annual incomes of at least $93,222 would get the majority of the benefits in this bill. Fully 84 percent of the benefits would go to families making more than $75,000 a year. 
The poorest families in this country, those in the bottom 20 percent of the income scale, would receive 0.4 percent of the benefits of this spending out of the back door. 
Let me say that again: 0.4 percent, less than one-half of 1 percent, of the benefits go to the 20 percent of the population of this country who have the least money. 
These bars on this chart here really set this out. These are not my numbers. These are Department of the Treasury's numbers. Quite frankly, we would have had a chance to debate this had the bill come up through committee in the normal and ordinary course of things. But since we did not get that chance, we just were kind of surprised with having to vote for cloture on this bill today. We have not really had a chance to thrash through these numbers. 
But anyway, the Department of the Treasury tells us that in this legislation, the lowest 20 percent, as you can see, get the lowest amount out of this legislation. The highest income people get the highest amount. Families in the highest income quintile would reap $96 a year in benefits from this bill, that is to say, families with incomes over $93,000 a year. They would see $96 of benefits in an average year. 
Those in the fourth quintile--those earning more than $55,000 a year--would see only $32 in benefits in a given year. 
Families in the third income quintile--those earning at least $33,000--would get only $7 per year. So $7 for the middle-class families earning between $33,000 and $55,000 a year--$7. 
Families in the first and second income quintiles--those earning less than $33,000--would get virtually nothing from this plan. And you can see that on the chart. 
So really what you wind up with is a tax expenditure that creates a loophole, backdoor spending that will benefit rich people. 
All of my colleagues who have had doubts about--and we have debated in other contexts the voucher plans, and this and that and the other, and how to approach education finance in these times. We need to have that debate because there is no question but that we have great challenges before us in terms of the reform of schools and providing reform of the schools so that this generation of children will have an opportunity at least as great as the last generation gave all of us in this Chamber. 
At the core, this debate is about what kind of educational system are we going to have. I was a product of the Chicago public schools. I am proud to say that, because the public schools in 
Chicago gave me a quality education in a time when my parents certainly could not afford to send us to private schools. They did, from time to time, choose the private and the parochial schools in the area. And I went to Catholic school myself on a couple of occasions. 
But the fact is that the public schools in my neighborhood were good public schools. So it was a legitimate set of choices. We had good public schools, good Catholic schools, good private schools. We could choose between good and good and good. So it was just a matter of the nuances of the educational opportunity that our parents wanted to give us that made the difference in their decisionmaking. 
As we have gotten to this time, we are really challenged by the fact that there is not the kind of equal choice among and between educational opportunities for these young people. Very often--all too often--the public schools are troubled. Everybody who has given up on trying to fix public education, fix the public schools, says, `OK. Fine. To heck with them. Let's go create something else. Let's go support something else. Let's go voucher out over here. Let's send our kids to the Catholic schools. And let's go to the private schools,' or whatever. 
They will come up with alternatives as opposed to confronting and facing what do we do about providing quality public education to every child that will allow every child the same opportunity, will allow every child a chance to climb up the ladder of opportunity. Because, after all, Mr. President, as I think everybody is aware, the rungs on the ladder of opportunity in this country are crafted in the classroom. The kind of education that a child gets not only is important to that child as an individual, but to our community as a whole. 
It just seems to me that we cannot afford to lose a single child. We cannot afford to triage our educational system, cutting off the schools that have to deal with the problem cases, that have to deal with the poorest students, and letting everybody else go out and take advantage of tax loopholes to provide themselves education in another venue altogether. 
Mr. President, the distributional effects of this tax expenditure really are easily explainable. Again, had we had a chance to talk about this in committee, we would have had that kind of debate. But to talk about why this works out this way, if you think about it, low- and moderate-income families, people that make $33,000 a year are having a hard enough time putting food on the table for their families as opposed to being able to just salt away and save an additional $2,500 a year, 
which is at the core of this proposal. 
It should be apparent--maybe it isn't--the contradiction in this proposal. It calls itself `an education individual retirement account.' The fact of the matter is, retirement accounts are supposed to be for people in their sunset years, money put away for retirement when they can no longer work. If you say we are going to use that vehicle to let people use money for a lot of other things, then you are, by definition, defeating the notion that people will be able to save, put secure money away, and let it build up so they can retire on it. 
This says, OK, we will use the vehicle for the retirement account model to let people save for private education. Assuming for a moment that made sense, again, what do you do when you have a situation where the people who need it the most get it the least? What do you do when people who are making $33,000 a year who can't salt away $2,500 a year for this, who can't build up the interest in the accounts? That is an important part of this--who can't build up the interest in these accounts. What happens to them in this situation? They wind up being left out in the cold. 
If we are thinking about the bang for the buck for tax expenditures, this backdoor set of expenditures, it seems to me, it is the taxpayers who are going to be called on to help make up the difference with the loophole we have created, and they will get the least from it. 
Mr. President, there is another whole set of issues in this bill that, again, had we been able to talk about it in committee we could have gone further in understanding the meaning of the actual language of the legislation. The bill defines `qualified elementary and secondary education expenses' as `tuition, fees, tutoring, special needs services, books, supplies, computer equipment . . . and other equipment, transportation, and supplementary expenses required for the enrollment or attendance of the designated beneficiary of the trust at a public, private or religious school.' 
In addition, the bill provides a `Special rule for home schooling' so any of the above expenses qualify if the child is home schooled. 
I just read it off, and I have the words in front of me, what does any of this mean? What does `required transportation expenses for home schooled child' mean? If you are staying at home, do you still get a transportation deduction? Does that mean a new car for mom and dad? What does that mean? We don't have enough information to make decisions about the $4 billion expenditure without having debate in this committee. 
Now, given the broad nature of the language of the bill, the possibilities for abuse are almost limitless, except for one caveat: The ability to use these provisions and reap the benefits of this broad statute would be restricted, again, almost exclusively to the wealthiest Americans. 
Now, it is OK to say we want to give rich people tax cuts. If that is the argument, that is fine. But it seems to me it is not altogether appropriate to dress it up and say that we are doing this for the poor children of America when, in fact, this is a tax subsidy for wealthy people. And they just got a tax cut. It would be different if they had not just gotten a tax cut. 
An argument in the Finance Committee with the last bill--which I supported, the tax bill--was that we were cutting taxes at that time in ways that would benefit the wealthiest Americans. There are some people in the committee that didn't have a problem with that, who said the wealthiest Americans pay the most in taxes, they should get the most back. If that is the argument, that is fine. But it seems to me somebody ought to say that. The people ought to say that instead of wrapping it up in `education reform terms' when, in fact, the goal of educational reform, of saving our school system, will not be achieved. 
I have other specific concerns with this legislation. 
The bill attempts to limit the availability of these educational savings accounts to single-filers with annual incomes below $95,000, and joint-filers with annual incomes below $160,000. During the Ways and Means markup, however, the question was asked whether a wealthy taxpayer could avoid this limitation by making a gift to the taxpayer's child, who would then make the contribution to the education savings account. According to the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the bill would permit such a shell game, as long as the child earned less than $95,000. They described the income limitations on the education savings accounts as `porous.' 
Mr. President, in addition to benefitting only the wealthy and being written in such as way as to be virtually unadministrable, there is yet another problem with this bill which leads me to believe we are considering this bill mostly for symbolic reasons. In order to meet the revenue figures required by the offset that has been chosen, the bill only allows contributions to be made to the new education IRA's for elementary and secondary education for the next 5 years. 
Mr. President, the purpose of IRA's is to encourage long-term savings. The proposal before us today makes a mockery of this concept, by allowing contributions for only a 5-year period. In so doing, it also creates a situation where everyone who puts money into these accounts will need to hire accountants to figure out what they are allowed to do and how much they are allowed to various education and education-related activities. 
The bill allows contributions of up to $2,500 for the first 5 years. These contributions, and the interest earned on these contributions, could then be withdrawn at any time to meet certain education expenses from kindergarten through college. After the first 5 years, however, the bill limits contributions to $500. These contributions, and the interest earned on these contributions, could then be withdrawn only to meet certain higher education expenses. Over a long period of time, the bill thus creates a situation where some amount of the interest that has accumulated in the accounts could be withdrawn for one purpose, while other interest that has accumulated concurrently could only be withdrawn for another purpose. To say that these accounts would be difficult to manage is an understatement. 
Let me say this in closing, I encourage my colleagues to redirect this retreat from quality public education in this country. There is no question but that we have to reform the public school system. There is no question but that the Federal Government certainly needs to do more in terms of supporting elementary and secondary education. We are right now paying less than 6 percent of the cost of the public schools in this country, which is not fair. It is not fair to property taxpayers. It is not fair to local taxpayers. In the main, education funding comes out of the local property taxes all over this country. If you ask anybody what is the tax they hate the most, it is their local property taxes. 
We are, for all intents and purposes, tying the ability to fund the schools to people who have fixed incomes and who really don't have the ability to pay more in property taxes. That is one of the reasons why the schools are troubled, frankly, in so many areas of this country. Those communities that have the least property taxes, that have the least ability to expand in that regard, have the most troubled schools. Why? Because you have tied education to fixed incomes or to declining tax bases. 
We have a General Accounting Office study, in fact, that shows that the poorest areas in the country make the most tax effort to try to pay for their schools. It seems to me, Mr. President, that with all these issues to take up and with all of the challenges to reform public education so that every child in America can access a quality education, we ought to do that in the context of having open debate, not trying to shut off debate on something that, again, effectively only helps the wealthiest Americans. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this retreat from public education, to reject this retreat from education reform, to oppose this measure, and to vote against cloture.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to join the celebration of the 75th anniversary of American ORT, and to congratulate Senior Federal Judge Abraham Lincoln Marovitz on being American ORT's Diamond Jubilee Award winner. 
Each year, American ORT provides high-technology vocational training and education to over 6,000 students in cities across the country, including Chicago at the Zarem/Golde ORT Technical Institute. Worldwide, ORT teaches comprehensive technical skills to over 250,000 students in 60 countries. As a private, nonsectarian, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, ORT has provided hope and opportunity to hundreds of thousands of people through high quality vocational education. 
The stunning success of American ORT during the past 75 years certainly would not have been possible without the presence of its brightest star, Senior Federal Court Judge Abraham Lincoln Marovitz. The contributions made by Judge Marovitz to American ORT, the State of Illinois, and our Nation are, quite simply, without peer. 
Judge Marovitz overcame humble beginnings amidst the poverty of Chicago's west side to lead a remarkable life of public service. After graduating from Chicago-Kent College of Law at the age of 19 in 1927, Judge Marovitz went on to serve as an Assistant Illinois states attorney and an Illinois State senator. In 1943, at the age of 38, Judge Marovitz waived his senatorial deferment and enlisted as a private in the U.S. Marine Corps. After seeing combat and being wounded in the Pacific Theater, he retired from the Marines with the rank of sergeant major. 
In 1950, Abraham Lincoln Marovitz was elected judge of the Superior Court of Illinois. From 1958 to 1959, he served as the chief justice of the Criminal Court of Cook County. Judge Marovitz received national recognition for his jurisprudence in 1963 when President Kennedy appointed him as the U.S. District Court Judge for the Northern District of Illinois. In 1975, Judge Marovitz assumed senior status as a U.S. District Court Judge, a position in which he continues to serve the people of Illinois and the Nation. 
Judge Marovitz has not been content to focus solely on his career. Instead, he has freely given both his time and talents to a wide range of community organizations. In addition to his association with American ORT, he has served groups including the Jewish War Veterans of the United States, the National Conference of State Court Trial Judges, and the American Legion. Moreover, Judge Marovitz served as chairman of the board of the Lincoln National Bank for 17 years, was a board member and trustee of Chicago-Kent College of Law and the Chicago Medical School, the Chicago Bar Association, and numerous other civic, religious, and veterans organizations. 
For his voluntarism, Judge Marovitz has been honored by organizations such as the Variety Club, the Daughters of the American Revolution, the Anti-Defamation League, the United Neighborhood Organization of Chicago, the Jesse Owens Foundation, the Chicago City Council, the State of Illinois, and the State of Israel. These awards are but a few of the many testaments to his unyielding devotion to and enduring love for his fellow man and woman. 
For all his civic commitments, Judge Marovitz has never lost his common touch and regard for individuals no matter their station in life. Specifically, I am personally ever indebted to him for the many kindnesses he showed me years ago, when I was a young assistant U.S. attorney. 
Without a doubt, the city of Chicago, the State of Illinois, and our country have benefited greatly from the many selfless contributions that Judge Marovitz has made over the years. He is not only a Chicago treasure, but a national treasure as well. I take great pride in congratulating him on his American ORT Diamond Jubilee Award. It is also my distinct honor to celebrate 75 wonderful years of ORT in the United States.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure and privilege to join the friends and family in celebrating the 100th birthday of a distinguished citizen of Riverdale, IL, Miss Florence G. Hedke, on November 11, 1997. 
Miss Hedke is a testament to Riverdale's heritage. She began teaching at the Bowen School in 1919, and later became the school's principal before retiring in 1964. Miss Hedke cherished her experiences at the Bowen School so much that she now lives in the building that was once home to the original Bowen School. 
As an educator, Miss Hedke inspired her students to dream, encouraged excellence and showed them the many avenues of opportunity made available through learning. She gave her students the foundation for their dreams. Her influence on the many students she touched has enriched their lives, and ours, in ways too numerous to calculate. She gave young people the confidence in themselves and hope for the future. 
The Village of Riverdale, the State of Illinois, and our nation are all better as a result of Florence Hedke's talent, love and commitment to education. She is truly one of Illinois' special treasures, and I am honored to join in the celebration of her 100th birthday.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of William Kennard to serve as Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same. 
There is perhaps no industry that has undergone more rapid or greater change than the telecommunications industry. In terms of technology, ownership, and opportunities, the communications industry has literally undergone a revolution. These changes will create opportunities for consumers, existing companies, and new entrants. In the coming years, the FCC will face enormous challenges as it attempts to cope with these changes and finishes implementing the provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
No one is more prepared for that challenge than Bill Kennard. He has demonstrated exceptional leadership and mastery of the issues during his 4 years as general counsel of the FCC, and his many years as a telecommunications lawyer. When I think of Mr. Kennard, I think of something that Jean-Claude Paye, former Secretary General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said of the changing times in which we live. He said that societies concerned about their economies ought to look to their fraying social fabric, as economic growth is the weave of national character. The waft of it, he said, are the people who embrace and master social change. 
Bill Kennard is one of those individuals. He will bring to the helm of the FCC not only an understanding of the industry and the economics, but the social and societal implications of the issues that he will address as Chairman of the FCC. 
Mr. President, I expect great things from Bill Kennard and I look forward to working closely with him as he steers the telecommunications industry into the 21st century. I commend the President for choosing such a qualified and competent individual for this duty, and I hope that every one of my colleagues will support his nomination. 
I thank the managers of this nomination, and I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, this morning the Senate was once again blocked from considering campaign finance reform legislation. As a result, the ISTEA reauthorization bill has been delayed. 
What happened today was clear. Intense opposition to any consideration of campaign finance reform legislation has precluded consideration of one of the most important measures to come before the Senate this year, the ISTEA reauthorization bill. ISTEA has been derailed for the time being because the majority party has refused to agree to even schedule a debate on campaign finance reform. They have refused the will of a majority of the Senate to engage in a debate over an issue that goes to the very heart of our Government and our democratic process. 
The 48 Senators who voted against cloture today did not vote to kill the ISTEA reauthorization bill, as some have claimed. We did not cast our votes against cloture because we objected to this critically important highway and transit bill. Rather, we cast our votes against the obstructionist techniques that have been used to block debate on campaign finance reform legislation. We refused to cast our votes to end debate because there has, as of yet, not been debate over campaign finance reform. 
Several weeks ago, the Senate engaged in a mock debate over the issue. It was not a real debate. Not a single amendment was offered. Not a single vote was taken. It is the business of the Senate to consider amendments and vote on issues and debate concerns of the American people. None of that has happened. It was as undemocratic a debate as I have yet seen in the Senate, and I know that the American people expect more from us. 
They are frustrated and disillusioned with the current election process. We need to get Americans back into the system and get them involved in decisions that affect their lives. We need campaign finance reform to restore the American people's faith in the electoral process. Too many people believe that the current system cuts them off from their Government.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, I attended the White House Conference on Child Care. Business, labor, and religious leaders will be sharing their strategies and successes for improving and expanding child care opportunities. This afternoon's discussion is entitled `learning from what works.' 
In government, we can do no better than to look to the private and nonprofit businesses and organizations in our communities to learn what works. With today's focus on child care issues, I commend to my colleagues, this month's issue of Working Mother Magazine, and it's 12th annual survey of the 100 best companies for working mothers. 
The companies included on the 100 best list are ones that provide working mothers with exceptional opportunities to contribute to the company's success, and to care for their families. Working Mother Magazine measures companies based on five criteria: pay, opportunities to advance, child care, flexibility, and other family friendly benefits. 
The 100 best companies have made a commitment to strengthening families and communities. At the same time, these companies are strengthening their bottom line. In order for our Nation to remain globally competitive in the 21st century, we must utilize all of the talents of all of our people. Working mothers have talents and abilities our country cannot afford to be without. The 100 best companies are utilizing creative, effective solutions to the problems working mothers face as they try to balance career and family concerns. By doing so, these companies profit as mothers are able to focus more energy and attention on their work. 
Making jobs work for women and their families is what these companies are all about. I am especially proud that 7 of the companies on the 100 best list are based in my home State of Illinois. Each of the Illinois companies has taken steps to recognize the talents of working mothers, and to help them help their families. Among other accomplishments, 
Allstate Insurance Co. recently opened a $3 million child care center in Northbrook, IL, that not only provides child care at the company's headquarters, but also offers full day kindergarten and holiday, vacation, and backup care; 
Amoco Corp. provides elder and child care referral services that were used by over 6,000 employees last year, and provides reimbursements for child care expenses accrued due to travel or overtime; 
Leo Burnett Co., Inc., continues to promote working mothers to executive positions. Today, the president and the chief creative officer are women; 
Fel-Pro, Inc., offers family friendly programs ranging from an 8-week summer camp to a $1,000 savings bond for newborns. Fel-Pro has been included in the 100 best list since its inception years ago; 
First Chicago NBD Corp. has been improving on their already impressive array of services with financial support for adoptions, and benefits for part-time employees; 
Motorola, Inc., according to the magazine, `remains the corporate leader in providing subsidized child care for employees' kids'; 
Northern Trust Corp. has doubled the number of employees working at home in the past year; and 
Sara Lee Corp. has a commitment to helping working mothers advance. Today, its general counsel, chief financial officer and treasurer, among others, are female. 
This list includes some of the most successful companies in the country, including the largest advertising firm in the country, and one of the Nation's oil companies. What each of these seven corporations has shown is that both companies and children benefit from policies that take not only the employee, but her whole family into account. Working mothers are an important asset to the Nation's employers. Strong families are an important asset to us all. 
I urge my colleagues to read this month's issue of Working Mother Magazine so that we can learn from industry leaders--we all benefit from policies that support working families.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure and my privilege to join the family, friends and colleagues of a distinguished citizen of Chicago, IL, Mr. Raymond W. Fannings, in honoring him as he retires from the Chicago Child Care Society. Mr. Fannings served as executive director of the Chicago Child Care Society for the past 18 years. 
Raymond Fannings leaves the agency with a rich legacy. He has more than 35 years of faithful and distinguished service in the field of child welfare. His contributions are widely recognized and his many community service awards serve as a testament to his compassion, commitment, talent, and vision. As the first African-American Executive Director of the Chicago Child Care Society, he has built bridges and forged interracial coalitions in behalf of the values held and goals pursued by this renowned social service provider. 
Under Mr. Fannings' leadership, the Chicago Child Care Society expanded its mission and became a moving force in the development and provision of family preservation services. Raymond Fannings also recognized the importance of responding to community needs. He dedicated substantial resources to both develop and implement services in many of the economically distressed communities surrounding his agency. 
During Mr. Fannings' illustrious career, he served as president of the Child Care Association of Illinois and as a board member of the United Way Crusade of Mercy. He is the current president of both the Child Care Association of Illinois and the Black Executive Directors Coalition. He has served on the Child Advisory Committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee for United Way, and the United Way Board of Directors. He is also a board member of the Free People's Clinic, president of the St. Mark Credit Union, and an active member of St. Mark United Methodist Church in Chicago. 
Mr. Raymond Fannings has distinguished himself as one of Chicago's most valuable leaders, and his achievements and dedication are a shining example to us all. His efforts have opened avenues of faith, hope, and opportunity for many children and their families. As my neighbor and friend, I know that retirement will only be the beginning of a new chapter of his advocacy for children and for community. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, S. 25, the Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1997 does not represent my ideal package of reform. In fact, S. 25 is far from it. I believe, however, that this legislation does bring us one step closer to getting the kind of real, comprehensive campaign finance reform we so desperately need. 
We need to get Americans back into the system and get them involved in decisions that affect their lives. We need campaign finance reform to restore the American people's faith in the electoral process. Americans are frustrated; many believe that the current system cuts them off from their government. A League of Women Voters study found that one of the top three reasons people do not vote is the belief that their vote will not make a difference. We saw the result of this cynicism in 1994 when just 38 percent of all registered voters headed to the polls. And we saw it again in 1996 when only 49 percent of the voting age population turned out to vote--the lowest percentage of Americans to go to the polls in 72 years. 
I have noticed a difference in voter turnout since my own election. In 1992, I won with 2.6 million votes, which was 53 percent of Illinois' total vote. In 1996, Senator Durbin won with a vote total of 2.3 million, which was 55.8 percent of the total vote. Senator Durbin won by a greater margin but with fewer total votes cast. 
Unfortunately, the effort needed to raise the average of $4 million per Senate race decreases the time Senators need to meet their obligations to all of their constituents. According to recent Federal Election Commission figures, congressional candidates spent a total of $765.3 million in the 1996 elections, up 5.5 percent from the record-setting 1994 level of $725.2 million. That figure does not include the huge amounts of `soft money' spent by political parties. 
Furthermore, when voters see that the average amount contributed by PACs to House and Senate candidates is up from $12.5 million in 1974 to $178.8 million in 1994--a 400 percent rise even after factoring in inflation over that period--there is a perception that lawmakers are too reliant on special interests to make public policy that serves the national interest. More and more voters believe that Members of Congress only listen to these special interest contributors, while failing to listen to the very constituents who put them into office. 
That is part of the reason why there is overwhelming public support for reform. And make no mistake, there is a real public consensus that reform is needed--now. Ordinary Americans want--and deserve--government that is responsive to their needs and problems. The way to do that is through spending limits. Spending limits will make our system more open and more competitive. Spending limits can help focus elections more on the issues, instead of on advertising. 
We must be sure that we don't have a process that only further empowers political elites that are already empowered. We want campaign finance reform that allows candidates more time to talk to voters. Voters want to know that the system works for ordinary Americans and not just those few who can devote substantial time and money to politics. They deserve better than the present system.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, while I congratulate Senators Bond and Mikulski on their efforts to craft this year's VA, HUD, and independent agencies appropriations bill, I would like to take exception to language contained in the Senate committee report regarding the Fair Housing Act and property insurance. 
The report contains two paragraphs regarding the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity's continued exercise of regulatory authority over property insurance under the Fair Housing Act. I would like to remind my colleagues that discrimination in the provision of property insurance is a clear violation of the Fair Housing Act. 
In 1988, Congress gave the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] the authority to promulgate regulations to enforce the Fair Housing Act. At that time, HUD under then-President George Bush and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp--issued a regulation which defined conduct prohibited under the Fair Housing Act to include: `refusing to provide property or hazard insurance for dwellings, or providing such insurance differently, because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.' 
The reason for this prohibition is simple. Without property insurance, no lender will provide a mortgage. Without a mortgage, few individuals can buy a house. 
Recently, Federal courts of appeal in two different circuits have held that the Act applies to insurance discrimination, and the Supreme Court has denied petitions to review those holdings. [See NAACP v. American Family, 978 F.2nd (7th Cir. 1992) cert. denied, 508 US 907 (1993); Nationwide v. Cisneros, 52 F3d 1352 (6th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 64 U.S.L.W. 3560, (Feb. 20, 1996)] 
Some have maintained that combating insurance discrimination has nothing to do with civil rights, but rather is a regulatory issue. Enforcement of antiredlining provisions, however, is not insurance regulation--rather, it is about prohibiting discrimination, a subject that, under our Constitution, is clearly the responsibility of the Federal Government. The law works to ensure that insurance--like all other goods and services--is available to all citizens, regardless of race. 
The Senate report contains language stating that the `McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 explicitly states that unless a Federal law specifically relates to the business of insurance, that law shall not apply where it would interfere with State insurance regulations.' Current law does not violate the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Federal courts have consistently held that the Fair Housing Act only adds remedies for illegal discrimination--it does not preempt any State regulation. 
The Senate language also states that `HUD's insurance-related activities duplicate State regulation of insurance.' While most State insurance codes do address issues pertaining to unfair discrimination, referring to treating the same insurance risks differently, these State insurance laws generally lack the protections and remedies provided by the Fair Housing Act. 
Congress has consistently rejected the argument that the Federal Government should leave the enforcement of civil rights to the exclusive jurisdiction of the States. Even in States whose civil rights laws address discrimination in property insurance, protection equal to the Fair Housing Act is all too often lacking. Currently, only 29 States have laws and enforcement mechanisms that have been certified as substantially equivalent to the Federal Fair Housing Act. Federal enforcement must continue if we are to eliminate property insurance discrimination nationwide. 
Nothing is more central to the American dream than owning your own home. Millions of Americans work hard and play by the rules to reach that goal. But if homeowners, or would-be homeowners, are redlined by insurance companies, they are denied their chance at the American dream. 
The Fair Housing Act is the basic protection against property-insurance discrimination. I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure that homeowners and their families can continue to enjoy the protections of the Fair Housing Act and realize the American dream free from discrimination.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I would like to put a question to the Senator from New Jersey. The Senator's points are very well taken and particularly the point that the Senator makes with regard to the synergies, if you will, between different types of transportation modalities and how all of them come together in this ISTEA legislation. 
I would like to call to my colleague's attention a picture really that I shared earlier this morning concerning the pivotal role as almost a hub State that Illinois plays in terms of national transportation. Because our State, Illinois, is situated kind of in the middle of the country as it is and goes from north to south, as it turns out, most of the commodity flows--this is from 1993--as you can see, most of the commodity flows go through the State of Illinois. Whether from California on the west, Florida on the south, Florida-Texas, or from the east coast, they come together at the hub in Illinois. 
Yet, having said that, it is also a fact that Illinois right now is suffering from inadequate attention to the convergence of transportation and transit activities in the State. We have seen in my State real difficulties with road funding to begin with. I have some headlines here: `Illinois Roads in Shambles,' and then it goes on with report after report regarding the dismal shape of Illinois roads. `Illinois Roads Among the Worst in the Nation.' That is on the road part of the equation. 
On the transit part of the equation, it is also news back in my State that there have been reductions in service for public transportation, moving people from place to place so as to give a breadth, if you will, to the economic activity in the State. 
So with both the road aspect of funding as well as the transit function, Illinois winds up being a hub State. Actually, in addition to being a hub State, Illinois is a donor State. We wind up contributing more to the funding of our interstate highway program than many other States. We are way down there in terms of dollars sent to Washington and dollars received back. 
My question to my colleague would be whether or not the formula with respect to highway funding takes into adequate account the importance of the hub activities, of the convergence of transportation modalities in a State such as Illinois and whether or not this legislation addresses the transportation needs of the country by failing to adequately do so?

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Will the Senator yield for another question? Is it not a fact that the original ISTEA, Intermodal Surface Transportation Act, referred to the needs of local and interstate commerce, the national and civil defense? And, in so doing, makes direct reference to the needs of the various States to work together to collaborate in behalf of our national interest in commerce, in both local commerce and national commerce, as well as our defense needs? And is it not also a fact, therefore, that to the extent that this legislation focuses in just on miles of road as opposed to these goals of the act, that it not only creates a burden for the States so affected, but also creates a burden for the country in failing to meet the express goals of the original legislation?

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. If the Senator will yield, I suggest the biggest threshold challenge that we have to overcome in this debate is a matter of one's perspective. If indeed this is seen as pitting one State's interest against another State's interest, then one can arrive at a formula that rewards the powerful and `who is on the committee,' and all kinds of factors that have nothing to do with commerce, with our national civil defense, with transportation or, indeed, our economy. 
If, on the other hand, our perspective is one of those larger goals that were pointed to in the original act, then that would lead to a formula in the first instance that would produce a very different result, or a different result than the one that we see here. 
So I ask my colleague whether or not it is his impression, since he has worked so diligently and closely on this matter over time, whether or not the formula itself may be flawed in that it sets up this competition among and between the States instead of requiring us to focus on what is in the interests of our country, what is in our national interests, what is in the interests of transportation as a generic label for all the ways we move goods and services and matters of interest around, within the United States.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. That seems to me exactly the point. When you base a formula on per capita income, what happens then is, No. 1, just at the outset you wind up penalizing those States that are contributing the most. 
There is an interesting quote out of the Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations, which I want to call my colleague's attention to, which says, `Per capita income is not a proxy for State wealth.' 
That is exactly what is happening, using that as a proxy for State wealth. It is much to the point. It is not just a matter of sharing. Because, if anything, I would encourage the Senator from New Jersey and my colleagues to think about this as something in which we are called upon to share. We are called upon to share resources in our national interest to see to it that the transportation needs of our country are adequately addressed. 
But what we have here, it seems to me, is a formula that is flawed--No. 1, in regards to the numbers that go underneath it that are used to determine State wealth, on the one hand. It seems to be flawed also in not giving adequate consideration to the use and reuse and overuse, in some instances, of transportation modalities, whether they are roads or highways or transit systems. The fact is, the more people you have the more these systems are going to be used. Just like any other physical thing, the more that it is used the more it deteriorates. 
So we have a situation in which infrastructure, as a fundamental issue, is addressed in this legislation based on a series and a host of factors and considerations that may not adequately comprehend that this infrastructure is infrastructure that serves all of our needs. It's not just New Jersey's roads or Illinois' roads. It's roads through which American products will move, roads over which Americans travel, transportation that allows for an American economy. All of us have an investment and a stake in seeing to it that all of the States that form the crux of our economic mix get adequately served by the allocation that this formula represents. 
So, my question to my colleague--and this will be my last question to my colleague--my question to my colleague is whether or not he believes that it will be possible for us to engage with the committee and others--I am not a member of the committee but at the same time have tried to interact with the committee that made this decision--but whether or not, if we were given the additional time to take up these questions, in terms of whether the formula presently being used to allocate resources actually meets the needs of our country--if given additional time we might be able to reshape some of the integral parts of that decisionmaking in way that it would more closely serve the goals of the Transportation Act?

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, the times in which we live, and the challenges we face, require a special type of courage and vision to capture the attention of those we would lead into the next millennium. As never before, leadership is being tested in the crucible of social and family crises. We have witnessed the virtual implosion of the family unit. Violence encroaches on front yards and in school-yards. The most vulnerable among us--the aged, the infant, the ill--are all impotent in the battle to survive downsizing, right-sizing, and the budget ax. Yet, the bull rush is on. 
To be sure, enormous problems demand imaginative, visionary, and courageous answers. Where do these answers come from? In the case of the Nation's Capital--from behind the pulpit has stepped a champion for the people--Henry Beecher Hicks, Jr. The citizens of the District of Columbia, and surrounding environs, are fortunate to have among them an extraordinary man whose vision is focused, and whose commitment to the uplifting of America is unequivocal. 
By title, Dr. H. Beecher Hicks, Jr., is the senior minister of the Metropolitan Baptist Church. By practice, he is a relentless advocate for the poor, consistent proponent of self-determination for the District of Columbia, champion for children and quality education, haven for the homeless, Samaritan for the sick, and a preacher's preacher who stands behind a pulpit adorned with a dove. 
As an author and a teacher, he is respected in academic circles across the Nation. Never compromising excellence, he demands rigorous study and mental acuity from his students. He is at home wherever he places his bible--from the ivy covered walls of a New England cathedral to a revival tent pitched on the muddy shores of the Mississippi. Dr. Hicks is revered by those in front and behind the pulpit. Academically grounded and oratorically gifted he is one of the Nation's foremost preachers. 
On October 18, individuals from around the Nation, as well as those he mentors and pastors, will gather in Washington, DC, to pay tribute to his 20 years of service as senior minister of the Metropolitan Baptist Church. I take this opportunity to join them in saluting this outstanding pastor and preacher.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, October 6 is German-American Day, and it is my pleasure to recognize the more than 57 million Americans who trace part of their ancestry to Germany. 
Since the arrival of the first German immigrants in Philadelphia in 1683, German-Americans have distinguished themselves through their cultural, economic, and political contributions to life in the United States. Through their participation in American society, German-Americans have demonstrated their loyalty to their new homeland and their strong support of our Nation's democratic principles. 
The German-American Friendship Garden in Washington, DC stands as a symbol of the positive and cooperative relations between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany. I urge every American to acknowledge and honor the contributions to our Nation made by German-Americans, and to celebrate October 6 as German-American Day.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. To my colleague and friend from Texas, I raise the point that this is not just a matter of a mandatory system for everybody but themselves, referring to people in the District of Columbia, but, as I understand it, the State of Texas has rejected an attempt to put in vouchers. So this issue is one which is applied to the District but not to the State of the Senator from Texas. I think we ought to consider for a moment if it is not good for Texas, it is not good for anyone else in the country. 
I point out this argument about helping poor kids ought to be looked at very seriously. Are we really helping poor children, No. 1, and, No. 2, does it help poor children to hold them out to be guinea pigs in an experiment that has not worked anywhere that it has been tried for which we have no information and in which, quite frankly, it represents a clear capitulation and a clear admission of failure, not just of failure, but of a lack of will to reform and revive the system of public education that we have in the District of Columbia? 
The fact of the matter is, the $7 million that is to be diverted from the District schools won't fix a single school, won't fund reform and won't support the children who are there. I think that we should be building up the schools, not tearing them down, not taking money or bleeding money away from a public school system that admittedly is troubled. We want to reform the public schools in the District, but they have started a reform effort and, much as the reform effort in my home State of Illinois, it has shown to have great success where there is energized and committed leadership. We can reform our schools if we will just believe that they can be reformed, if we will just invest in them. 
The fact is, again, with the $7 million we could make a real difference in the D.C. public schools. We could fully fund every after school program in the D.C. schools. We could buy 368 new boilers for the schools. We could rewire 65 of the schools that 
don't have the electrical wiring to accommodate computers and multimedia equipment. We could upgrade the plumbing in 102 schools with substandard facilities. We could buy 460,000 new books for the D.C. school libraries. 
Instead of engaging the $7 million to fix what we have, we are going to say, let's bleed this patient to death, let's spin off enough for 2 percent of the schoolchildren and leave the others behind. 
Let me point out for a moment, and it has been mentioned in the debate already, that one of the schools in the District just today had to close because of a leaky roof. As you know, I have been speaking about the whole issue of school facilities for a while, and in the District of Columbia, we see, according to reports by the General Accounting Office and others, that 67 percent of the schools have crumbling roofs. 
If you know anything at all, you know if you have a leaky roof, you are likely to have walls that collapse and floorboards that curl and electrical wiring that can't be used. So having a leaky roof goes to the very heart of the environment for learning. 
Are we going to put the $7 million into fixing some of those crumbling roofs? Apparently not, according to this plan. 
Sixty-five percent of the schools in the District of Columbia have faulty plumbing, again, a situation where we have children who go to schools where the plumbing doesn't work. Yet, instead of saying we are going to fix the plumbing we are going to engage to support and build up and improve education for these kids, we are going to spin off some of them into another system, again, that has never been tried and created, and that we don't, frankly, know whether or not it is going to provide any benefit at all even to them. 
Forty-one percent of the schools don't have enough power outlets and electrical wiring to accommodate computers and multimedia equipment. Everybody knows in this generation of students, computers are what books were to my generation. The kids have to have computers, and that is one of the reasons people do want to have quality education because they want to make certain their youngsters can get on the information superhighway. You can't plug the computer in if you don't have electrical wiring in the wall. 
Yet, instead of putting $7 million into fixing the electrical wiring in the schools, we want to spend that money somewhere else. 
Sixty-six percent of the schools have inadequate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. Again, I don't know if people listening have spent a summer in the District of Columbia, but if you get here toward summertime, being in a room without air conditioning is close to being sentenced to purgatory. The children in the public schools would benefit if we were to make the kind of investment in them, as opposed to, again, bleeding the system as this proposal suggests. 
I think, Mr. President, though, that at the heart of this debate is really almost a sad kind of capitulation, a sad kind of a lack of will that says that education is just a matter of whether or not I got mine, get yours, go into the market, buy an education for this chit and if you don't get a chit and can't buy a better education, that is too bad for you. The whole notion of public education is that it creates a public good, that it is something that benefits all of us, and that public education becomes, if you will, the great center of meritocracy that defines what this country is all about. 
The ladder of opportunity is crafted in the classroom in America. What we are now saying is that some will get the opportunity and others will not. Assuming for a moment that this proposal were adopted--and I am going to do everything I can in opposition to it--but assuming it were adopted, of the 80,000 children in the District of Columbia, about 2,000 of them would be served. That would leave then 78,000 children left behind, left behind with schools that have crumbling roofs, faulty plumbing, not enough electrical power, and inadequate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. That is what this proposal really represents. 
I had in my office two students who were interns briefly. They were actually high school students from the District of Columbia. The reason they were working in my office as recently as last week was because they couldn't go to school, and they couldn't go to school because the courts had closed their school down for bad facilities. The infrastructure was so bad in their schools that they had no place to go to get an education. So we took them in to give them an opportunity just to do something during the daytime. 
In the face of that failure, how we can suggest or how it can be suggested that bleeding that system even further instead of investing in it and giving it the support seems to me to be not only shortsighted but counterproductive. I think we can afford to waste no child. I think we should leave no child behind. To the extent that the combination of money and leadership, because it is not just money alone, it has to take an engaged population, if we engage to preserve, to revive and to reform these public schools, we can save them, and we can provide opportunity for all of our children. 
The idea is not to create a two- and three-tier system of education so some can get and others cannot, what we want to do is have quality education for every child, so whether that child is an orphan or that child has parents who don't understand the school system or don't speak the language, that child will not be left behind in that which we have relegated to the back burner, that which is left over after we have siphoned off the resources into a private system. 
I say let's not make the children of the District of Columbia guinea pigs in this ill-considered experiment. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership, for his consistency, and for his outstanding advocacy on behalf of children in this country. I think it is fair to say, and everyone who hears my voice will recognize, there is no one that Ted Kennedy takes second place to when it comes to fighting for children. He has been a leader and continues to be. 
I am so pleased to have this opportunity to join him in strong opposition to this voucher proposal. Let me touch for a moment on what I see as the central flaw with this voucher proposal--whether it is for the District of Columbia or any other school system. Voucher programs for elementary and secondary education presume that a market-based solution will solve problems that exist within our public education system. 
We have heard a lot about competition in the system. That suggests that there will be a meeting in the marketplace and that quality will rise out of that competition, out of that meeting of forces in the marketplace. I point out to anyone listening, if you think about it for a moment, markets by definition have winners and losers. The question then becomes whether or not we can afford to impose a market-based solution where the welfare of all of our children is involved. We cannot afford in this country any losers in a game of educational roulette, or, as much to the point, in an approach to what for all intents and purposes is an educational triage in which only those youngsters who have the family structure, who have the ability, can retreat from the public school system, leaving whatever else is behind. 
It is very interesting, by the way, that a lot of the discussion goes to providing poor children with options. The fact of the matter is that public education in this country excelled precisely because it wasn't just about poor children. It was about providing quality education to any child of whatever wealth, from whatever communities, whether their parents were engaged with their education or whether their parents were found lying in a gutter somewhere. A child who had more talents than means could access quality education because our system supported quality public education. 
Education is about more than an individual's ability to get trained for a good job, although certainly that is one of the benefits of it. We are very clear, without education individuals are handicapped when it comes to the job market. 
The point has to be made, and made over and over again, that it is more than about just individuals. Education is a public good as well. It is a private benefit, to be sure, but it is also a public good. It is something that affects our entire community. It affects the quality of life in our community. It affects everything from health status to voter behavior, to whether or not individuals, or whether or not communities, will support our democracy and appreciate the higher values of our community. 
Quality public education has shaped our democracy. It created a strong middle class. It propelled our country to the top of the world's economic pyramid. The rungs of the ladder of opportunity in our country have historically been crafted in the classroom. I think our generation has an obligation to see to it that the legacy of quality public education is not abandoned and, as much to the point, is not diluted by efforts, such as this one, to divert resources and divert support away from the public education system. 
The reason that we have compulsory education in this country is not so that every child can access the best education that his or her parents can afford or find, but so that every child can receive a quality education. If our public schools are not meeting that challenge, then it is our responsibility to fix those schools. A federally funded voucher program would not fix a single public school. 
In fact, if anything, this effort represents a retreat from the challenge of making our schools work for every child, making our schools rise to the level of excellence that as a community we have every right to expect. 
Vouchers represent putting individuals over the interests of the whole community. Vouchers necessarily will benefit only a small percentage, a small number of students. Consider for a moment there are roughly 46 million public school students and 6 million private school students. Any large-scale voucher program would obviously overwhelm the private schools. Advocates claim that entrepreneurs would start up high-quality schools to meet the demand. Just look at the potential for abuse and ask yourself the question, what do we do when we look up and discover a whole slew of less-than-quality school facilities in which people's only objective is to make money? There is no reason to think that by providing this spinoff of resources from public education that we would wind up with a system that was any better. 
Supporters of the voucher proposals claim they would help the neediest children the most. I submit that both research, experience, and common sense suggest otherwise. Researchers have concluded that academically and socially disadvantaged students are less likely to benefit from school voucher programs. It is amazing to me that the academic research on this subject has not gotten more attention. Voucher programs in other countries where they have had such programs confirm this research, that, indeed, the voucher approach, spinning off from the public school system, has led to economic as well as social segregation of students. Instead of narrowing the gap between wealthy and poor, instead of narrowing the gap between communities of students, the voucher proposals when implemented had the effect of widening the gap. I don't think we want in our time to be responsible for widening the inequalities among students. If anything, we should be endeavoring to narrow that. 
As a matter of fact, in one study that took place in Chile, performance actually declined for low-income students. That is not surprising because any use of public funds for private schools requires that fewer resources be devoted to the public schools. Since the vast majority of low-income students will remain in the public schools and the worst of the schools are, for the most part, already sorely underfunded, it is just evident that private school vouchers would further weaken public education. 
Right now, the Federal Government--it is ironic that we are having this debate--the Federal Government right now currently only meets about 6 percent of the costs of elementary and secondary public education in this country. We don't even provide the funding--and I know the Presiding Officer will recognize this issue--we don't even cover the costs of unfunded mandates in education. To further divert resources from what we are already not doing makes absolutely no sense at all. 
Transferring funds from public schools to private schools will not buy new textbooks for public school students or encourage better teachers to move to the public schools nor fix a single leaking roof on a public school. All it does is divert resources, precious resources to begin with, away from the system that is already underfunded and that needs it the most. 
Supporters of private school vouchers claim that those schools are better managed, they perform better, and cost less than public schools. Again, the facts suggest otherwise. 
It is absolutely true that some public schools are inefficient. Again, vouchers don't solve those inefficiencies. What solves those problems are good managers. In Chicago, in my hometown of Chicago, IL, innovative leadership and a `no excuses' attitude totally reshaped the system there in the space of about 2 years. Under the leadership that is now in place, our school system is improving itself to the benefit of all of the 425,000 students in that system, not just the select few who might have been spun off with a voucher plan. 
Every school system calls upon the people, the leadership of 
that community, to focus in on management issues, to address the longstanding issues of neglect and of finance that have hamstrung our ability to provide quality public education to all children. 
The evidence also disproves the claims that vouchers improve student achievement. Annual evaluations of the program in the city of Milwaukee concluded that vouchers have not done so. Again, I call my colleagues' attention to all of the research that has been done in this area. There is no scientific evidence to support the notion that somehow by taking away from public education you improve it. 
As for cost, again, the private schools can cost less in some instances because only 17 percent of them provide special education, which, of course, is a high ticket item. It costs twice as much to educate disabled children. Again, the point ought to be made that the public schools take everyone. They are schools in which all consistencies, all kinds of students, whether they are rich, disabled, poor or whether their parents have problems, or whether they are troubled, all students come. With compulsory education they have to. By setting up a system that spins off a part of the student body, all we are doing, again, is creating a situation in which those who are the most able and the most capable and have the most family support will leave the school system and leave behind those who are least capable of doing well for themselves. 
Here in the District of Columbia--and, again, this is once again the District of Columbia being made into a guinea pig, for all intents and purposes, for ideas that are floating around without addressing the real challenges of the District of Columbia--I, too, had interns in my office, students from the District of Columbia, who interned in my office precisely because the schools were closed here. 
Why were they closed? Because the court had decreed that the school environment, the facilities were crumbling so badly that it was unsafe and hazardous for children to go to school there. It would be more appropriate for us to devote the money being proposed to be taken out here to rebuilding the crumbling schools in the District of Columbia, to making sure the roofs don't leak and the windows aren't broken and the electrical systems work, to fix the schools that we have, to meet the challenge of supporting public education instead of coming up with yet another excuse not to support the schools we have in place already. 
This approach, in my opinion, represents, in the final analysis, a retreat, a pessimistic capitulation to a winnable challenge. We can fix these schools. We can do at least as much as the previous generation did, our parents. The generation before us left us a legacy of a system of quality public education in which every child, no matter what the circumstances, can get an education consistent with their talent without regard to their means. We have an obligation to do no less for the next generation of Americans. Coming up with an approach that will spend away resources from our system of public education does not keep faith with that legacy of support for quality public education as an integral and central part of the American dream.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Madam President, I support S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997. I also want to commend Senators Jeffords and Kennedy for their hard work on this legislation, and the compromises that will ultimately improve the FDA and improve the public's access to cutting edge medical technology. 
Despite recent improvements, I am concerned that the length of time and amount of paperwork required for FDA approval of new products may still be excessive. For many companies desiring to market new products, application to the FDA is a formidable obstacle. In some cases, the length and complexity of the process can deter companies from even applying. This is a particularly troubling prospect given the increasing globalization of markets for health care products and food. 
The FDA cannot continue to protect the public health through its traditional methods. Most industrialized and emerging nations participate in multilateral trade agreements that aim to reduce trade barriers. These agreements will continue to bring pressure on the FDA to harmonize its regulatory policies with other international safety and performance standards. The policies that have made the United States the `gold standard' in public health protection must be reformed to function properly in this global economy. This does not mean that we cannot continue to be the gold standard. It simply means that market forces will bring pressure on the FDA to implement policies that encourage the launching of new products in this country, as opposed to Europe, and ensures that the United States maintains its technical and scientific leadership in health disciplines. 
As stewards of this generation, we must move to strike the balance between protecting the public health, fostering global trade under multilateral agreements, ensuring swift access to new health technology for Americans, and strengthening the U.S. technical and scientific leadership. S. 830 is a very good effort to balance those sometimes competing goals. 
First, the bill reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act [PDUFA] for an additional 5 years. PDUFA has been one the most successful pieces of governmental reform legislation. During the 5 years since we first passed PDUFA, the average approval time for pharmaceutical products has dropped over 40 percent. There is still more room for improvement. Many product reviews remain cumbersome, and applicants at times do not have a clear indication of the type of information necessary for FDA review.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Thank you. 
I actually was prepared to put a question to the Senator from California. 
I want to commend the Senator for her stewardship and working with the Senator from North Carolina on this issue because getting this appropriations passed for the District of Columbia is not only important but long overdue. It is unfortunate that the District winds up being a guinea pig of sorts for every kind of experiment that we have. 
I just commend the Senator from California for the poignancy of her statement and her plea that amendments not be brought to this bill that would delay its passage. 
It is kind of open knowledge that the schools in the District of Columbia, many of them, have been closed because they were crumbling and falling down. The courts would not allow children to attend schools in that kind of condition. And they have just recently reopened. 
In fact, we had working in my office two young high schoolers from the District of Columbia. Pursuant to a project that Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton put together for all the displaced children of the District, we took two of them into our office as interns while the schools were closed down. 
The schools have now reopened and those children are back where they ought to be, in a classroom, but it just seems to me to further displace all of those children because of a filibuster or an argument around an experiment with the District of Columbia schools would be cruel to say the least, and certainly an unfortunate development. 
So I commend my colleague for her plea in the first instance that we not have this battle because there is so much at stake, but also to put the question to her whether or not it is her opinion that the District can afford to delay further to wait for this appropriation to be finalized?

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the Chair. I am going to try to be brief. I have a lot to say and I will try to summarize. Some friends of mine were having a conversation over dinner, and their 5-year-old was sitting at the table. They were talking about this issue, the funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. And midconversation, the baby looked up and said, `Mommy, do Republicans hate Big Bird?' The answer is obviously that Republicans don't hate Big Bird and, in any event, `Sesame Street' is only indirectly supported by the National Endowment for the Arts. But there is little question but that some have made this issue one of those wedge issues to inflame passions about cultural values and the role of Government, to pit people against each other and, again, to make us angry at each other as Americans, and focus in on those things that make us different from one another, on the things that separate us instead of the things that bring us together. 
Public support of the arts ought to be one of those points around which we as Americans can come together, because it is one of the ways in which we define ourselves as Americans and in which we communicate the richness of our American culture. 
The NEA follows in a noble tradition of publicly supported art initiatives. Just last night, we were over at the Library of Congress, and there we had an opportunity to see firsthand what public support of the arts can do. That building is one of the more magnificent treasures of this country. I hope every American can have the opportunity to see it. I was particularly impressed by the room in which we held our meeting, which had been built by American craftsmen--publicly supported, following the end of the Columbian Exposition in my hometown of Chicago--who brought a variety of skills to bear on its creation, the woodworking, plaster work, painting, ceramics--some so beautifully done that it lifted spirits just to look at them. 
Some of them were so refined that, frankly, the talents, skills, and art involved are in danger of being lost to us forever. 
Then in another part of the Library of Congress, there is a wonderful exhibit of the Works Progress Administration that was started, as you know, during the Depression, by President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt started WPA to hire starving artists, and, frankly, every American should be grateful that he did. The work that they did, preserved for us the indigenous music out of the Delta of Mississippi, folk music and blues--and oral histories that would have been lost to us forever. We would not have the value of the photographs and the paintings and the music and the original art that had been created all over this country had it not been for the activities and intercession of the WPA. And so they did all of this wonderful stuff and left it as a legacy to all of us. 
By and through the arts, the cultural fabric of our country was reinforced during some of its darkest days. Now the National Endowment for the Arts, which was created in 1965, is under attack again. I point out what their charter says. It says: `To foster excellence, diversity and vitality of art and broaden public access to the arts.' 
That is the charter; that is what NEA is supposed to do, and that is what it in fact has done. Has it followed tradition? A look at the good things it does for our country resoundingly answers that question. In Illinois, it has supported the YMCA of Chicago, The Lyric Opera, the Art Institute, and other large institutions that might have private support, but then it also, most importantly, supports those smaller institutions that would not have the help otherwise. 
We have in Illinois received NEA grants for the Peoria Symphony and the Little City Foundation, Glenn Ellyn Children's Choir--activities that would not have the support and would not be able to leverage private dollars were it not for the NEA. 
These community initiatives educate children, provide adults with the tools to socialize our young people, help communities to build on positive values which art inspires. 
I would like to quote from Tolstoy for a moment who defines art `as a human activity having for its purpose the transmission to others of the highest and best feelings to which men have risen.' 
Obviously, this amendment, I think, takes the position that if you do not have private money, those positive values won't be available to you or to your community. 
Have there been embarrassments among the projects supported? Of course there have. As with any art, some of it will at all times be repugnant to somebody. There is 16th century art around that some of my colleagues will find offensive. That is a matter of their personal taste. But the truth is that in any republic such as ours the freedom we enjoy starts with the proposition that individual expression is a positive value. Instead of allowing for the fact that expression will be of all kinds, the sponsors of this amendment would shut down all expression because they don't like some of it. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this attempt to divide us as Americans, and I urge their support of the NEA. 
I thank my colleagues for their indulgence and thank the Chair.  
Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am introducing this bill today to provide relief to Janina Altagracia Castillo-Rojas and her husband, Diogenes Patricio Rojas. These two individuals, who currently reside in Chicago, IL, face deportation later this month to the Dominican Republic as a result of an absurd technicality in current Federal immigration law. 
Ms. Rojas has been denied citizenship because her mother was the child of a U.S. citizen female and foreign male. Previous law allowed only children of U.S. citizen males and foreign females to claim U.S. citizenship. 
Simply put, Mrs. Rojas has been denied U.S. citizenship because she had the `misfortune' of having a U.S. citizen grandmother instead of a U.S. citizen grandfather. 
In 1994, Senator Paul Simon passed the Immigration and Nationality and Technical Corrections Act, which allowed individuals born overseas before 1934 to U.S. citizen mothers, and their descendants, to claim U.S. citizenship. As a result of that 1994 law, the mother of Janina Rojas applied for U.S. citizenship, which she received in January 1996. 
When Janina Rojas attempted to derive citizenship as a descendant of a direct beneficiary of the 1994 law, however, her application was denied. Despite the 1994 law, the Immigration and Naturalization Service requires that the mother of Janina Rojas meet transmission requirements: the mother must have been physically present in the U.S. for 10 years prior to Janina's birth, 5 of which were after the age of 16 years, in order for Janina to derive citizenship. Since her mother was prohibited from becoming a U.S. citizen until 1996, however, it is unreasonable to require that she was in the U.S. for 10 years. 
Clearly, while 60 years of discriminatory law was corrected in 1994, the citizenship qualifications of the line of descendants of those U.S. citizen females remain adversely impacted. 
On May 1 of this year, I introduced a bill, S. 677, the Equity In Transmission of Citizenship Act of 1997, that will waive the parental transmission requirement for the grandchildren of U.S. citizen females. That bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. While I am hopeful S. 677 will be promptly approved, it may not be approved before September 27, the deportation date of Mr. and Mrs. Rojas. The private relief bill I introduce today will provide an extension for Mr. and Mrs. Rojas so that S. 677 can be taken up and passed.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Etta Moten Barnett on the occasion of her recent 96th birthday. Mrs. Barnett is a remarkable woman who has lived a life of great artistic and civic achievement. 
By the time she was 30, Mrs. Barnett was married, had three children, divorced, and returned to school. After receiving a fine arts degree in voice from the University of Kansas, Mrs. Barnett moved to New York City to begin an illustrious career in show business that would take her around the world and before millions of people. 
Mrs. Barnett distinguished herself with her incredible singing ability, both on the stage and on the silver screen. Her theatrical accomplishments include Broadway performances of `Porgy and Bess', `Fast and Furious', `Sugar Hill', `Zombie', and `Lysistrata'. George Gershwin wrote the role of Bess with Mrs. Barnett in mind, and she performed in the starring role in the first revival of `Porgy and Bess' on Broadway in 1942. 
Mrs. Barnett's film credits include `The Gold Diggers', `Flying Down to Rio', and `My Forgotten Man'. Her stirring performance in The `Carioca' earned the film an Oscar nomination for best song. After seeing her in `My Forgotten Man', President Franklin Roosevelt invited Mrs. Barnett to personally sing for him, and thus, she became the first African-American woman ever to perform at the White House. 
Although Mrs. Barnett stopped performing in 1952, her contributions to American society continued. Along with husband Claude Barnett, the founding director of the Associated Negro Press, Mrs. Barnett took an active interest in issues affecting people of color around the world and became a champion of equal rights for all people. 
As a founding member of the North Shore Chapter of the Links, Inc. in Chicago, Mrs. Barnett continues to give freely of herself to numerous cultural and civic organizations. Her commitment to improving the plight of women throughout the world was recognized when she was the first nongovernmental organization representative of the Links at the United Nations. 
Etta Moten Barnett is truly an American legend. In honoring her 96th birthday, I join her family, friends, and colleagues in commending her for her outstanding accomplishments. Her talent on Broadway and on film has touched thousands of Americans, and her hard work, gracefulness, and civic-mindedness has inspired and set an example for thousands more.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join the Minority Leader, Senator Daschle, to introduce the Education Facilities Improvement Act. This bill will form a partnership among the national, State, and local governments to rebuild and modernize our Nation's crumbling schools. 
According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, it will cost $112 billion to bring existing school buildings up to code--to patch the leaky roofs, replace the broken windows, fix the plumbing, and make other needed repairs. That price tag, as enormous as it sounds, does not include the cost of building new schools to accommodate the record numbers of children who are crowding our schools, nor the cost of upgrading classrooms for modern computers. 
Local school districts cannot afford to meet these challenges on their own. The local property tax, which made sense as a funding mechanism when wealth was accumulated in the form of land, no longer works as a means of funding major capital investments. In urban, rural, and suburban schools all across the country, the magnitude of the crumbling schools problem has dwarfed local financing capabilities. 
In Chicago, Mayor Daley announced Monday that the city would issue 800 million dollars' worth of bonds to build new schools, renovate old ones, and modernize every school in the system. With an improved bond rating, Chicago has financed almost 1.5 billion dollars' worth of school improvements in the last 2 years. Chicago schools, however, need 3 billion dollars' worth of improvements. 
The problem is not confined to big cities like Chicago. The GAO found that in urban areas, 38 percent of schools are crumbling, while in rural areas the figure is 30 percent, and in the suburbs, it's 29 percent. 
At the New Burnside Center in Tunnel Hill, IL, the track team was for a time forced to practice at the local prison. The prison had a track. The school did not. They no longer offer track at New Burnside, because some parents objected to their children being sent to the prison to practice. The lack of an adequate tax base means too many schools in rural areas can barely meet the basic costs of educating children, let alone the costs of major capital improvements. 
In the suburbs also, our outdated method of paying for public schools has taken its toll. Principal Rita Melius, from the Abbott middle school in Waukegan, a suburb north of Chicago, was here in Washington this morning to discuss this issue. Children in her suburban school have to cope with the same kinds of leaky roofs and crumbling walls as their innercity peers. The school has even had several fires caused when computers overloaded the ancient electrical wiring. 
The Education Facilities Improvement Act will provide $1.9 billion over 5 years to help Waukegan, Chicago, New Burnside, and schools across the country that simply cannot meet their facilities needs on their own. It will make the Government a partner in public education, while preserving local control of curriculum and educational content. This bill recognizes that education is a public good, as well as an individual benefit, and that every American benefits when we provide educational opportunities in environments suitable for learning. 
Winston Churchill said, `We shape our buildings; thereafter, they shape us.' Nowhere is that more true than in our schools. You certainly can't use a computer if you can't plug it into the wall, and we cannot expect our children to learn in schools that are falling down around them. 
I hope all of my colleagues will consider the conditions of schools in their States and join us in sponsoring this important legislation.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Highway Bridge Improvement Act of 1997 with my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. 
This legislation would increase the authorization for the Discretionary Bridge Program from its current level of around $60 million annually to $800 million annually. This change would allow States with large bridge improvement projects to compete for discretionary grants at the Federal level. 
Mr. President, in 1995 approximately 25 percent of the Nation's Interstate bridges were classified as deficient. In addition, 28 percent of the 130,000 bridges on all other arterial systems were deficient. As the Congress considers ISTEA reauthorization legislation later this year, it is vitally important that we continue the successful Highway Bridge Repair and Rehabilitation Program, and substantially increase the authorization level of the Discretionary Bridge Program. 
Since its creation in 1978, the Discretionary Bridge Program has been a valuable source of funds for many States. Demand for funding under the program has vastly exceeded available resources. In 1996 alone, States submitted 29 requests totaling $650 million. The program was authorized at less than one-tenth that level. 
The Highway Bridge Improvement Act would increase the authorization for the Discretionary Bridge Program to $800 million annually, allowing States to compete for discretionary bridge repair grants above and beyond their formula allocation for bridge repairs. 
Mr. President, this bill does not include a set-aside for the Highway Timber Bridge Research and Demonstration Program, nor does it include a new proposal I support to create a Steel Bridge Research and Construction Program. Our legislation is a very simple statement about the importance of increasing the authorization for the Discretionary Bridge Program. 
As my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee draft legislation to reauthorization the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act, I hope they will include the timber and steel bridge set-asides, and I hope they will include the Highway Bridge Improvement Act. 
I urge all of my colleagues to consider the needs of the bridges in their States, and to support this important legislation.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, for the first time since 1969, Congress has balanced the budget. This is not just a victory for Congress. This is a victory for the American people. 
I am reminded of a term that is used in science known as `vector addition.' Simply stated, it says that you subtract forces working against one another and you add forces working with one another. 
While I am not here to talk about science or math, my point is that we diminish our collective energy when we work against each other, but we expand our ability to help everyone when we work together. When we set aside our differences, we are stronger as a Nation and stronger as a people. By working together we move forward, and that means that everybody wins. 
Mr. President, the American people are winners today because of the spirit of cooperation that went into the tax relief and spending reduction bills, a credit to the leadership of President Clinton, the leadership of the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, and the leadership of the Budget Committee chairman, Senator Domenici, and the ranking Democrat, Senator Lautenberg. 
Mr. President, this is people-oriented legislation, and I am pleased to be able to say that it is bipartisan legislation that invests in our children and in their futures. It achieves fiscal responsibility while at the same time it is socially fair. It improves health for children and health care for the elderly. It takes at least a small step toward rebuilding our Nation's crumbling schools and a much larger step toward expanding opportunities for our children to attend college. 
Most importantly of all, we are providing real tax relief for American families. For the first years of the new century we will see in this country a balanced budget again for the first time in a generation. 
This legislative victory did not come without sacrifice. The foundation for today's achievement was had in 1993 when Congress, by the narrowest of margins, enacted the highly successful 1993 deficit reduction legislation that has already brought down the Federal deficit from over $280 billion to about $65 billion, or perhaps even lower, this year. Critics argued at the time that the bill would plunge our country into a recession, that it would stoke inflation, and that it would throw hundreds of thousands of people out of work. A few of our senatorial colleagues who supported the bill later lost their elections because of that support. Those Members of Congress chose statesmanship over politics, and today I think it is important to pay tribute to their foresight. 
The legislation that we passed this afternoon builds on what we achieved in 1993. It nonetheless represents an enormous accomplishment, one in which every American can take justifiable pride. The United States is once again leading the way to get its fiscal house in order while investing in families, children and in students and in economic growth. By contrast, in Europe, deficits in many countries as a percentage of their gross domestic product are triple what ours is--and even higher--and they have no solution in sight. Again, I believe that we have shown the way to achieve fiscal responsibility and social fairness to the world. 
As a Member of the Senate Finance Committee, I am pleased that this bill reflects a number of my own particular priorities. First, it helps young college graduates to repay their student loans by making the interest deductible once again. We all know how rapidly college costs have increased and are increasing and how many students start out their working careers with huge debts, huge student loan debts. The proposal that Senator Grassley and I worked together on will make a real difference to graduates as they begin to start their careers to begin their families. They will be able to deduct the interest on those loans. And given sometimes that those loans can be as high as $80,000 and $90,000, this should be a benefit to young people who want to pursue education. 
Second, the bill contains a version of the proposal that I offered in the Senate that will help to create new economic activity and new jobs at thousands of abandoned commercial and industrial sites around the world. 
There are all too many brownfields sites in our communities, property that had formerly been used by business but which has become environmentally contaminated or polluted and then abandoned. By allowing those individuals who want to clean up these polluted areas and use them for new businesses, by allowing them to expense the costs of their environmental cleanup rather than having to capitalize those costs over a period of years, it will create a brand new incentive to bring this property back into the economic mainstream, to create jobs, to clean up the environment, and to restore and reclaim parts of our communities all over this country. 
Third, this bill will begin to address a problem that I have spoken about on the Senate floor many times, the crumbling schools around America. Since I have come to the Senate, I have worked to forge a new Federal and State and local partnership to rebuild our Nation's crumbling schools. We cannot lift our kids up if our schools are falling down, and I am pleased that this bill has taken the first step in that direction by creating a new category of no-interest bonds for communities to use to rehabilitate their schools. High poverty districts will be able to issue $800,000 in bonds to repair their schools, to pay for new teacher training, new equipment purchases and other expenses needed for revitalization of educational facilities. 
I think that is an important step in the right direction. It does not begin to do all that we need to do, but it is a step. 
The bill also increases the small issuer arbitrage rebate exemption for certain school facilities funds which provide some small rural schools with relief from the burdensome administrative requirements associated with the issuance of tax-free bonds. And so everybody wins under this approach to rebuilding the schools. Although these proposals, frankly, are dwarfed by the $112 billion in school construction need that the General Accounting Office has documented for us, I think these two provisions send a message that Congress believes there is a Federal role for rebuilding our Nation's schools and for cooperating and supporting State and local governments in their efforts. This is not about interfering with local control in any way. We just want to begin to engage as a national community to provide support for States and local governments to do what they deem appropriate in terms of giving our young people the educational facilities they need in which to learn. 
I believe it is inexcusable that in our country, the wealthiest nation in the world, every day 14 million children go to schools with broken windows, leaking pipes and overcrowded rooms, and I appreciate the leadership that is being demonstrated in this area. 
I look forward to continue with Congressman Rangel on the House side, who made this one of his top priorities. I look forward to working with him and my other colleagues to create a true partnership among the Federal, State, and local governments, again, to get our school facilities in shape, to bring them up to code and to give our young people the kinds of facilities that they deserve for a 21st century education. 
I want to take particular note, also, of the changes that were made to the proposal for the $500-per-child tax credit. This portion of the bill provides real help to hard-working American families, and I am particularly pleased that millions of families with incomes as low as $18,000 a year, families who pay thousands of dollars in payroll taxes but who have little or no income tax liability, they will now be able to take advantage of the $500-per-child tax credit. Those low-income families are doing exactly what everyone says they should do. They are working hard and they are paying taxes. They deserve this tax relief, and I am very pleased that, at the insistence of President Clinton, they will receive it as part of the compromise achieved in this bipartisan legislation. 
In addition, this bill takes many other steps to expand opportunity and economic growth. The Hope Scholarship will provide families with a tuition tax credit to help families carry the burdens of college costs. After the first 2 years of college, a tax credit of 20 percent of college tuition costs up to $10,000 annually will be available to students and their families. Moreover, employers' ability to deduct the employees' college tuition will be preserved in this legislation. That is an important kind of incentive, I think, to keep for our country. 
Lastly, students will not be forced to pay taxes on the scholarships and fellowships they receive for their hard work. I, again, believe these are positive steps in the right direction. 
The bill further ensures that children will no longer have to go without adequate health care. The bill contains the single largest investment in health care for children since the passage of Medicaid in 1965. It invests an unprecedented $24 billion to provide meaningful health coverage for almost half of the Nation's uninsured children. 
At the same time, the bill also protects something called EPSDT. That stands for Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Testing, which is very important in terms of the quality of service provided for children, eye and ear examinations and the like. It preserves a basic level of benefits and services for children under Medicaid, the Medicaid Program, and gives States the additional flexibility at the same time to assure that those children are covered with health insurance for the entire year, as opposed to the trend that we see now in which they come on and go off of the Medicaid Program. So children will have more insurance because of this bill that we passed this afternoon than they have ever enjoyed in this country before. I think that is important. 
Turning to the Medicare Program for seniors, I, like many other Members, had reservations, frankly, about the bill that we initially passed out of the Senate. I was one of the two members of the Senate Finance Committee who did not vote for the means testing or the age changes or the copayments on Medicare, simply because we had not looked at the issues enough, and because I think those changes simply shifted the program costs to beneficiaries rather than truly protecting Medicare. More important, rather than allowing us to bring more people into health coverage, it was pushing people out of the health care system. 
I am pleased we have not rushed to judgment in terms of changing Medicare, because, again, we should be moving in the direction of providing universal coverage and coverage for seniors that is comprehensive instead of cutting away arbitrarily and making arbitrary changes. So the commission in this bill will allow us to take up the debate of what changes should be made over the long haul to preserve the long-term solvency of Medicare so we can pass on to the next generation of Americans at least as much, in terms of health coverage, as we in our time inherited from the last generation of decisionmakers. I think that is our obligation here. 
I am pleased, also, that this legislation no longer includes the provisions to charge income-related part B premiums, increase the Medicaid eligibility age, nor charge seniors who prefer a home setting as opposed to institutionalization a $5-per-visit home health care copayment. These are vitally important improvements on the legislation. While many Members on both sides of the aisle disagree, I believe, again, we need to take this up, to have a public debate about what changes are appropriate before we rush to judgment in regards to that. 
The conference agreement also makes major improvements in the Medicare managed care payment rate changes. While I continue to believe that moving to a 50-percent national/50-percent local payment rate blend moves too far away from recognizing local cost differentials, guaranteeing a minimum payment update is a marked improvement over the original provisions as they even came out of our committee. So, again, the conference agreement strikes a more equitable balance between encouraging managed care growth in rural areas and underserved areas and not undermining the existing managed care enrollment. 
The legislation also retains a number of important aspects from the original Senate bill, including prevention services, if you will, coverage of diabetes self-management training, colorectal cancer screening, mammography screens without the deductible requirement. We had to fight and raise the point that the deductible on mammograms was absolutely inappropriate, so the investment in mammograms without deductibles will benefit an additional 2 million women. 
Again, a recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that a copayment causes a threefold dropoff in the number of women getting mammograms. So, providing this screening without deductible is vitally important to the health of American women. 
My praise for this legislation does not mean that I do not continue to have some major concerns about certain aspects of the bill. There are several non-worker-friendly provisions that I believe move completely in the wrong direction. One of those provisions has to do with overruling of the court decision in the Pennington case, which came out of my State of Illinois. Despite our success in stripping the preemption from the original Senate bill, the conferees have decided to restore it. I think that is unfortunate. But it is an issue that was folded in this legislation, and, again, the benefits of the bill weighed against these changes are something we will have to take up separately. So, while we did not Byrd-rule the issue on Pennington at this time, I understand there is legislation that I strongly will support in regards to that issue of unemployment compensation and security. 
The agreement also punts on the long-term Medicare solvency issue. Again, the commission will have to take up that issue. I look forward to their deliberation. 
One last thing having to do with my State specifically, and those parts of the country that we like to call the heartland. We were very interested in the ethanol tax credit. Ethanol has an important place in our energy future in this country. I believe we should be aggressively moving to promote its use. This legislation kind of keeps the ethanol tax treatment the same way that it is currently, instead of extending it into the future in ways that I thought would have been more appropriate. There were a number of us--in fact, 70 Members of the Senate voted for the more extensive treatment and support for ethanol. Again, that came out in the conference and that is regrettable. But we will continue to fight this fight on behalf of ethanol. I have every expectation and confidence that we will be successful in the long run. 
There are a lot of other provisions such as capital gains and estate tax provisions that I have not taken the time to discuss here today. I will not take the additional time to do so now. Instead, I just want to make it clear that I strongly supported the overall bill and the bipartisan approach that made it possible. It was that cooperation, that coming together, that building on our strength with the view and the interests of all the American people, that allowed us to have this victory today. 
We did the right thing for America's children. We did the right thing for America's students, our families, and we are doing the right thing for the next generation of Americans. Achieving fiscal responsibility and social fairness simultaneously is something that many thought could not happen. We have done it with this legislation that we passed, and I think every Member of this body who voted for it has reason to be proud of the work of this Congress. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Interstate System Improvement Act of 1997 with my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. 
This legislation would increase the authorization for the discretionary I-4R program from its current level of around $60 to $800 million annually. This change would allow States with large interstate improvement projects to compete for discretionary grants at the Federal level. 
As our Nation's interstate system ages, it is going to become more important for many States to have access to large, discretionary grants for major interstate improvement projects. For my home State of Illinois, this legislation would provide an opportunity to compete for funds to reconstruct a 15-mile segment of the aging Stevenson Expressway, one of the Chicago area's most important arteries, and one that is badly in need of repair. 
I believe this change is important to improve our current system of highway funding, and I urge my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee who are involved in drafting legislation to reauthorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act to include this legislation as part of their reauthorization bill.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, on Monday, the President's Advisory Commission on Race met for the first time. Amid the wide-ranging discussion on a variety of issues relating specifically to race, Chairman John Hope Franklin, the renowned doctor of history, discussed the centrality of education and in particular the physical condition of our schools and the centrality of that issue to the future of race relations in our country. 
Dr. Franklin noted that in his home of North Carolina, there are schools that are closed part of the time because it is too hot, and there are schools that are closed part of the time because it is too cold, and there are some that are closed part of the time because, when it rains, it rains inside the school as well as outside the school. 
Dr. Franklin went on to note that the problem of crumbling schools is not particular to race but rather it is a problem that transcends race. It is a problem that is essential, however, to any discussion of race because it speaks to the character of our Nation as a whole. I want to quote him because I think it is important. `It is a remarkable testimony,' Dr. Franklin noted, `to the profligacy of this country, that it will not provide decent educational facilities and opportunities for all of our children.' 
I believe Dr. Franklin is absolutely correct. According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, every day some 14 million children attend schools that are in such poor physical condition that they need major repairs or should be replaced outright. Some 12 million children attend schools with leaky roofs; 42 percent of schools with more than 51 percent minority enrollment have at least one inadequate building, and 29 percent of schools with less than 6 percent minority enrollment--less than 6 percent--have at least one inadequate building. 
In urban, rural, and suburban areas alike, schools are crumbling down around our children. According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, it will cost at least $112 billion just to bring them up to code. That price tag does not include the cost of upgrading schools so they can incorporate modern technologies in the classroom. The FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, recently finalized an initiative that will give the schools and libraries deep discounts on telecommunications services, which should provide millions of children access to modern technology that they would not have otherwise enjoyed. Too many of our children, however, will be unable to take advantage of this opportunity because their schools lack even the basic infrastructure necessary to allow a teacher to plug a computer into the classroom wall. Nearly half of the schools lack the basic electrical wiring needed to fully integrate computers in the classrooms. 
So the crumbling schools problem has ramifications even beyond leaky roofs. It cuts off the ability of our youngsters to take advantage of technologies that will help them grapple with the educational challenges that they face in their time. 
Schools are overcrowded, also. I have seen schools where the study halls are literally in the hallways, where computer labs are on the stairwell landings, and where they have erected cardboard partitions at the end of corridors in order to create makeshift classrooms. 
These dilapidated, overcrowded schools do not provide our children with the kinds of opportunities they will need to compete in the 21st century global economy. Nor do these aging and crumbling schools provide our children with the educational opportunities all of our children will need if we ever expect to move beyond the problems of race relations which have existed, like a sore on our Nation, since its earliest days. 
While Dr. Franklin was meeting with the President's Advisory Board on Race Relations, many of my colleagues over here were meeting to work out the final details of the tax bill. President Clinton's tax proposal includes an innovative proposal to address the conditions of crumbling schools. I hope my colleagues on the conference committee will see fit to adopt his proposal. 
The President has called for the distribution of allocable tax credits to the States, which would then offer those tax credits to developers and builders in exchange for their performing below-market-rate school construction or improvement projects. States and school districts need our help to address the problem of crumbling schools. We have to rebuild these schools for the 21st century to give our young people the educational opportunities that they need and they deserve. Doing so will help prepare our children for the 21st century economy and will help build a climate of tolerance among the people of our country. 
I would like to take a moment to read a letter to my colleagues that I recently received from a superintendent of a rural school district in southern Illinois. I remind my colleagues, Illinois--we used to have an expression, `Just outside Chicago there is a place called Illinois.' My State is largely rural once you leave the region around Chicago. I would like to read his letter, the whole letter, because I think it is important. Superintendent Lawrence Naeger wrote to me. He said:  
I am the Superintendent of Century Community Unit Number 100 School District near Ullin, Illinois in the county of Pulaski. I am writing to you in the name of the many citizens of my school district that support your efforts to put dollars back in the federal budget for school construction. 
From the earliest days of our school district, the school house has been a focal point of great community pride--a brick and mortar representation of the commitment which citizens of this school district have made to their children's education. Sadly, economic changes over the years have made our community's commitment more difficult. The alarming number of construction concerns that now exist point to a crisis waiting to happen. 
As time goes by, it becomes evident that small repairs and quality maintenance is not enough. Thankfully, there have been no major health or safety disasters directly related to the structures. However, it is apparent that the leaking roofs, rusted plumbing, overworked heating systems, and crumbling plaster are fast approaching a crisis point. Less visible, but also of great concern, are infrastructure problems related to overcrowding and/or the inadequacy of school facilities for education as we move toward the 21st Century. Classes held daily on a stage in a gymnasium in the elementary school, and electrical systems which are inadequate for today's learning technologies, stand in the way of quality education for our children. 
The Century Board of Education, trying to address these concerns, have been caught between competing demands for local dollars and increasingly restrictive laws regarding access to revenue. As anti-tax sentiment has grown, so too has the recognition that the state and federal governments must become partners in resolving school infrastructure concerns. 
The Century School district is clearly at a critical juncture with respect to the infrastructure of its schools. Decisions are being made on how school infrastructure needs can be adequately met, with a very limited budget. Money spent on infrastructure generally comes from local taxes. While the Century Board of Education is authorized to levy taxes to support its building needs, there are restrictions which severely limit the ability of the board to respond to the emerging infrastructure problems. 
It is important to note, in the not-too-distant future, infrastructure problems which currently exist will likely be compounded as our schools built in the 1950's and 1960's begin to wear out. Though age does not necessarily make a building dangerous or obsolete, construction at that time was typically rapid and cheap . . . 
Beyond the most urgent health and safety issues, there is increasing concern about the need for . . . infrastructure that can support educational reform and desired innovations, infrastructure conditions that can accommodate the integration of technology, infrastructure that can be accessed by all students regardless of disability, schools that can be used primarily for education but for other community purposes as well, and schools that can serve as safe havens protected from society's violence. 
In summary, the Century Board of Education is standing tall, providing the best opportunities for the children of the district to attend school in an environment that is physically safe and conducive to learning. We are being held accountable and are willing to take responsibility to address the deterioration of our school buildings. As well as the growing need for new construction. However, we need your help to fight on for federal dollars to continue the process. 
Please fight for our district, our community, our children, the hopes and dreams of all. Please continue to fight for all the children who attend inequitable and inadequate infrastructures, exacerbated by government red tape and broken promises. 
 Sincerely, 
Lawrence Naeger, Superintendent.  
Mr. President, I just want to point out as my time runs out here, the time really has come for all of us in government at all levels, at the local, State, and the Federal Government, to cooperate, to stop pointing fingers at each other, stop pointing fingers at the local school officials or the State education officials or the township supervisors and, instead, form a partnership among all levels of government to address this critical problem. 
I urge my colleagues to take a look at the conditions of schools in their own States and to consider the implications of crumbling schools for our children, for our country, for our future, and for the character of our Nation. That was the point that Dr. Franklin made on Monday. That is the point that I wanted to bring to the Senate's attention this afternoon. 
I am hopeful that, as we go through the rest of this legislative session, we can come up with innovative approaches to help States and local communities and local governments, such as represented by the letter I read, respond to their concern and need and interest in providing quality educational opportunities for all of America's children. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues Senators Murray and Snowe in sponsoring this amendment to allow women serving in the U.S. military overseas and dependents of U.S. military personnel serving overseas to obtain privately funded abortions at overseas military hospitals. 
Women serving overseas are fighting to protect democracy and freedom. These women should not be denied the basic, constitutionally protected rights enjoyed by women in the United States. One of those rights is the right to make decisions regarding one's personal reproductive health. 
This amendment repeals a ban that was put in place during the 104th Congress. That ban unnecessarily endangers the health of U.S. servicewomen and the dependents of service personnel overseas, and creates an additional and unnecessary hazard to military service for women in this country. This is unconscionable. 
It is important to remember that many of these women are not in countries with first rate medical care. The U.S. military has a presence in many countries where hospitals are woefully inadequate. In addition, in some of these countries women do not have the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy and so legal, safe abortions are not an option. 
Under this amendment, no doctor has to perform an abortion if he or she has a moral, ethical, or religious objection. That is a choice, however, for the doctor to make, not for the United States Government. After all, in our country the right to choose family planning and pregnancy termination services is constitutionally protected. 
The Department of Defense would not be required to pay for any abortion services provided in overseas military hospitals. This amendment would require that private funds be used to pay for the services. 
The basic facts are that this amendment protects the life and health of U.S. servicewomen and the dependents of military service personnel stationed overseas. Quality medical care, commensurate with that provided in the United States, where possible, is not too much for our Armed Forces to expect and to receive. 
I thank my colleagues, Senator Murray and Senator Snowe, for offering this amendment and for taking leadership in trying to preserve basic constitutional rights of our service personnel overseas. I urge my colleagues to support the Murray/Snowe amendment.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, this amendment says that if our economy does better than we today expect that it will, we will devote some of that increased revenue to help rebuild our Nation's crumbling schools. 
The General Accounting Office makes it very clear that we have at least 112 billion dollars' worth of unmet needs with school facilities around the country. State and local governments cannot go to the property tax to meet that 112 billion dollars' worth of need. So, I say to my colleagues, in the interest of the 14 million American children who, every day, go to schools that are unfit for human habitation and which are not suitable environments for learning, I ask support for this amendment. The funds from the tax credit would only be made available if actual revenue in the Federal Treasury exceeded CBO's annual revenue projections, and up to $1 billion above and beyond CBO revenue estimates will be deposited into a school infrastructure trust fund. It would be distributed to the States in allocable tax credits. This is a problem that will not go away. It will only get worse if we don't address it now. Thank you. 
Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. The Senator is correct. The total investment is $92 million for both facilities with an expected capacity of 42 million gallons of ethanol annually. This is good for farmers and good for our rural communities. I fully support extending the small blender's tax credit to these cooperatives, and I will urge conferees to support this.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 or 4 minutes. I want to make a general statement about the tax bill. 
I serve as a member of the Senate Finance Committee and was part of the deliberations. Last night, I commended the chairman of that committee as well as our ranking member for the efforts they made to try to craft a tax bill that addressed the concern that all of us had in achieving fiscal responsibility and in achieving fairness. 
In the first instance, the bill as a whole does achieve fiscal responsibility because it is a balanced budget bill. That is a good thing. The deficit under President Carter years ago was $73 billion. Under President Reagan, it ballooned to $221 billion. It reached $290 billion under President Bush. When President Clinton took office, he inherited a $290 billion deficit. Our national debt at the time was $4.4 trillion. 
Now, since that time, President Clinton's bill in 1993 to give us a budget agreement that would head us toward budget balance has proved to be successful, and it proved to be the 
right thing to do. That bill, at the time, was very controversial, but the fact is that it has worked and we are now in our fifth year of deficit reduction. The deficit now is at the lowest level that it has been since President Carter. I think that is something we all can celebrate and applaud. This bill continues in that direction. 
The reason why having a balanced budget is important is not just that it is a matter of a sound bite. Quite frankly, some of the economists tell us it is not the most critical thing, that you can function in terms of the budget overall without it being in balance. However, for me, and I am a strong supporter of achieving a balanced budget, to me, the issue is one of fairness, of generational fairness, of making certain that our decisions in our time do not foreclose the decisions that the next generation, these young people sitting here, that they will be able to make for their time, when they move into leadership and have the opportunities to make decisions. So as not to pass on our old bills, so as not to foreclose their opportunities, it is an important thing to achieve a balanced budget. This bill does that. 
However, as was pointed out by speaker after speaker, the way the bill is structured, the budget deficit does explode in the outyears, and that means that while it looks on the surface that we will have a balanced budget, at the same time we are setting ourselves up for a huge fall by allowing it to explode beyond the 5- to 7-year window. That is not a good idea. It seems to me if we are going to be really fiscally responsible, we have an obligation to balance the budget and then to keep it balanced. 
So this Democratic alternative cures that defect. It cures that defect by achieving fiscal responsibility by seeing to it that we do not balloon the deficit in the outyears. 
The other thing about this alternative is it is also fair. There are those of us who believe this is not a time to cut taxes, that we would be better off achieving complete balance before we got into tax cutting. And we could have cut the deficit quicker had we not cut taxes at this time. It is not a matter of being against tax cuts, just a matter of timing, whether or not it makes sense to go and give up your second job, if you will, while you are still trying to pay off your old bills. That is the equivalent, if it were a family making a decision, we are making a decision to give up the second job, although we still have old bills. 
There is consensus around the tax cuts that are in this bill. Capital gains--I do not think too many would argue that capital tax cuts are a bad idea. The estate tax cuts--again, my colleague across the aisle a minute ago talked about the importance to family farmers. I come from a State that is largely agricultural, and I know how important having the estate tax reform that is in this bill is to people who own farms. The help for people who have children is another good thing and will help struggling families--and the support for education in this bill. 
All of these things are good news, and that is why this alternative, I think, should be supported by both sides of the aisle, because this alternative says we are going to take the principles of fairness and make certain there is balance in terms of the whole American family, in terms of who gets what from the tax cuts. Right now the tax cuts are heavily stacked in favor of the wealthiest Americans. People who need help the most--the working people, the middle class--get less from this tax cut and less from this agreement than do those who are clipping coupons. This is not to set up a class conflict, because, if anything, if you learned anything in these times, it should be that as Americans we are all in this together and it cannot be rich versus poor. If anything, we all have to come together and make certain that we allow our economy to grow and to build and to tap the talents of everybody. But that, I think, begs the question of whether or not we are being fair in giving working families their due with regard to this tax bill. It does not reach that. 
Last evening, I spoke about the fact that such a vast majority of the benefits of this tax cut that go to the wealthy as opposed to the middle class or the working poor, that we can change that. Well, the Democrat alternative does change it. The Democrat alternative suggests that we do more for people who are struggling, that we do more for people who spend more of their payroll, more on payroll taxes than on income taxes, that we help those families that are just trying to get by and to make it. We help them a little more. That is what the Democratic tax alternative does. 
As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, again, part of the process here is the compromise. We worked together, and I voted along with many of my colleagues for the Senate Finance bill, and I will vote for it on final passage. I urge my colleagues to take a good look on both sides, take a good look at this alternative, and see in your own minds whether or not it does not strike you as being fiscally responsible, which we all want to do, but being more fair. You consider the number of people in this country and the interests and the wide range of income; we do not want to do anything at this time that will exacerbate that income gap that we all know is widening. If anything, what we want to do is try to keep the country on an even keel with regard to policies that we come out with here. 
For that reason, again, I support this Democratic alternative. I will support the bill on final passage. I hope this amendment is part of it. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for the spirit embodied in Senator Durbin's amendment to S. 949. This amendment seeks to increase the health insurance deduction for self-employed individuals to 100 percent. I agree that this is the right thing to do and that the Senate should consider options for ensuring that small business owners, particularly women, and farmers have access to the same tax deductions that are available to large corporations. I do not, however, agree with the way my Illinois colleague has suggested we pay for this particular increase, and for that reason, I cannot support this amendment. 
The bill before us today reflects a long and tedious, bipartisan compromise among the members of the Finance Committee. That compromise, which provides for increased access to education, increased savings incentives, family tax relief, and agricultural and business investment incentives, also reflects some hard choices regarding upon whom the burden to pay for such benefits should fall. A part of the compromise made by the members of the Finance Committee was the decision to forgo increasing tobacco taxes at the present time. This decision was made with due consideration to the ongoing tobacco litigation, which may result in a dramatic increase in current tobacco taxes. 
I definitely support the spirit of Senator Durbin's amendment. A 100 percent deduction for health insurance premiums could reduce the annual net cost of health insurance for a typical family by as much as $500 to $1,000. In addition, such a deduction could provide tax equity for the 10.6 million self-employed Americans who currently can only receive a 40 percent deduction, unlike large corporations, who currently can deduct 100 percent of incurred health insurance premiums. There is no doubt that there is merit to the goals of this amendment. 
As much as I would like to support the amendment presented by my colleague today, however, I believe that the compromise made by the Finance Committee should be honored. To do otherwise could place other programs and incentives of vital importance to the average American family and small business at risk. Because I believe that we have an obligation to make good on the promises of this bill, I cannot support this amendment.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, on behalf of the City of Chicago, and the State of Illinois, I would like to offer this Senate Resolution with my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator Dick Durbin, congratulating the Chicago Bulls for winning the 1997 National Basketball Association Championship. 
The Bulls have now repeated, once again, as champions--winning for the fifth time in seven years. This year's triumph expands the team's indisputable place in history. 
I say to my colleagues from Utah, Senator Hatch and Senator Bennett, that their great State of Utah was well represented in this championship series that ended Friday in Chicago. We should all applaud the Utah Jazz for a successful season, and an enormously exciting NBA Finals. 
The Bulls have put together an exceptional season and a remarkable dynasty. There should be no doubt that the Bulls are the best team in the 50 year history of the NBA, and that Michael Jordan is the best player. Despite suffering from flu-like symptoms, Jordan scored a dramatic 38 points in game 5 to lift his team to a crucial victory. To say `His Airness' is the Most Valuable Player is truly an understatement. 
And each and every Bulls player is a superb individual basketball player. What makes them all so very special is the way they have come together, under Coach Phil Jackson's guidance, to blend their talents as the team, playing in a way that makes each of them better. That is the real hallmark of champions. 
The Bulls have become a national and international sensation. They have brought millions together as fans and as admirers. Bulls fever cuts across race and ethnic lines and knows no national boundary. You can go to the far reaches of the globe and see a Bulls hat, or a Michael Jordan jersey. 
In recognition of the Bulls' historic accomplishment, it is my pleasure to offer this congratulatory resolution, and I urge my colleagues to swiftly approve its passage.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am the first woman in history to serve on the Senate Finance Committee, and I have been just delighted to work with the chairman and his staff and my ranking member, Senator Moynihan. They have been accommodating, they have been supportive and they have listened. And I have to say that this was the third occasion that I have had to work on a tax bill. While the tax bill did not result as I would have written it, at the same time, I can think of no better group with which to work than the members of the Senate Finance Committee and, particularly, its leadership. 
Mr. President, I want to share a few preliminary thoughts about the tax bill. I intend to file an expanded statement at a later time. At the outset, I want to say that I intend to vote for this bill. It was worked on by the committee. We worked hard on behalf of the goals of achieving a balanced budget. We worked hard on behalf of achieving an opportunity for the American people to focus their resources in the most productive way for our economy as a whole. 
When I came to Congress, my over-arching goal was to create a more fiscally responsible environment, a better fiscal environment for our children. We needed to reverse the trend to borrow, to pay for things now, at the cost of having our children pay back our debts and foreclosing their options and opportunities. Even though it caused some consternation, I supported a balanced budget amendment precisely because I believe that we have an obligation to prepare and to make it easier for our children than our parents left it for us. I believed that we had to ensure that we do not leave our children in greater debt than our parents left to us. 
So my main focus in coming here to Congress was to focus in on getting some order about our fiscal house, reducing the deficit, and actually beginning to create the framework in which our economy can go forward, and the strength that not having this burden of debt would have given it. For that reason, I also took the position that it was not time yet for us to go into providing for tax cuts, that we needed to restrain our desire to cut taxes until such time as our fiscal house was in order. Deficit reduction should have been our goal as a matter not only of our fiscal responsibility, but of generational fairness. And so I started off with that proposition from the very beginning. 
In 1993, the first year I was here in the Senate, I voted for the budget that President Clinton submitted that began the path toward deficit reduction. Since that bill, which was very controversial at the time--I remember people calling it the `biggest tax increase in history,' even though it only increased taxes on the very top wage earners or top income earners in our country. It was very controversial at the time. In fact, in the election that followed, a number of people lost office because people thought they had sent our country on the wrong fiscal path. 
However, that bill has proved, I think, over time, to be the jump-start that this economy needed in order to give rise not only to the booming stock market and booming economy that we have seen, but the deficit reduction that we have seen. Since the time of that vote, the deficit has gone from about $290 billion--almost $300 billion--to $65 billion this year. Now, without a tax cut, we could have retired our debt entirely before the year 2002. While it is a fact that some of the economists argue that we don't need to worry about deficits and we don't need to retire our debt, at the same time, I think there is an expectation from the American people that we would do everything we could to get that done in as timely a fashion as possible. Reducing the deficit would have had the effect of lowering interest rates and would enable us to 
provide even larger tax cuts, once we have paid all our bills. But that is not the case at this time. There is consensus for cutting taxes this year--a budget deal that explicitly tailored the amounts of net tax cut and outlays with some specific parameters. 
So since there is consensus on the tax cut that came out of the Budget Committee, and that is the direction we have been ordered to take in the Finance Committee, I believed that the tax cut given should be targeted to provide the maximum benefit to relieve families of the tax burden that they have to carry. Unfortunately, this bill only partially meets that goal. 
The problem, as I see it, and my one sadness about what we have seen here, is that this tax bill is not progressive. To make the bill progressive, the distribution of the tax cuts should allow the largest portion of the tax cut to go to the greatest number of families. This is simply community fairness. Unfortunately, this bill still allocates the largest amount of the tax cut to the fewest number of Americans instead of the other way around. 
This bill allows some 22 million American families to receive almost $40 billion in tax cuts, while 88 million families receive only about $20 billion from this tax cut. The average tax cut that will be received by families making less than $17,000 a year will be about $12. Families with incomes of less than $33,000 a year will receive an average of $64 from this tax cut. Families with incomes of less than $55,000 will receive an average $274 from this tax cut. Families earning less than $94,000 will receive an average of $583 from this tax cut. However, if you go beyond that, families with incomes above $94,000 will receive an average of $1,789 from this tax cut. 
In short, Mr. President, the 22 million Americans making over $100,000 will receive 65 percent of the tax cut here, while the 88 million people earning under $100,000 will receive about 34 percent of the tax cut. 
Now, there is no question that tax cuts are always popular. Many of the tax cuts which give rise to this result are popular, particularly the estate tax, capital gains reduction, and IRA expansion. But it seems to me that just based on sheer numbers, working class people should have fared better. Even though we tried to remedy some of these issues, we were not successful. Senator Rockefeller and I, for example, tried to remedy the effect of the $500-per-child tax credit; nonetheless, a majority of the working poor will be excluded from the largest part of this bill. 
Well, Mr. President, I have taken up my 2 minutes. I thank the chairman for his indulgence. I want to point out that, as we direct these issues of tax policy, we should be mindful that, if we really care about family values, about our total community, we need to have tax fairness as a guiding principle in our deliberations, with the greatest benefit going to the greatest number. It seems to me that what ought not to guide our deliberation is just what sounds good or what is politically popular or easy to do. We could have done a better job with this tax bill. I know the chairman tried and the ranking member tried; we all tried. This bill is a better bill than the House bill by a long shot. But, at the same time, I hope as we go into conference, we will be mindful that there are an awful lot of working people and families out there who need our help, and we have an opportunity and an obligation to give it to them. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman for his indulgence. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, the legislation pending before the Senate is designed to provide sufficient savings to implement the balanced budget blueprint we passed last month. While the balanced budget plan set the broad framework for balancing the budget by 2002, it was up to the various committees to implement this plan. This bill combines recommendations from eight Senate panels, including changes in Medicare, Medicaid, and spectrum auctions. I commend the committees for their work thus far because many of the provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 are long overdue steps in the right direction. It is clear that unless we get our deficit under control, we will be leaving our children--and our children's children--a legacy of debt that will make it impossible for them to achieve the American Dream. 
The best news about this plan is that it will help balance the Federal budget. More work however, needs to be done to meet our obligations to future generations of Americans, to invest in people, and to protect their retirement security. Every generation of Americans has addressed and resolved challenges unique to their time. That is what makes our country great. Now is the time to take steps toward ensuring that our generation will honestly address its needs so that future generations will have at least the same opportunity. Our generation should leave no less than we inherited. 
This is not a perfect bill before us today. My colleagues and I on the Finance Committee held several marathon sessions last week in order to craft a large part of this legislation. I think we reached agreement on a package of provisions about which everyone has some objections but also, all the members of the Finance Committee were able to support in the end. This unanimous support for the bill is a complete change from the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 and a testament to the leadership of Senators Roth and Moynihan. I want to congratulate my colleagues for working together in a bipartisan fashion aimed at not only improving the Medicare and Medicaid programs but also the Nation as a whole. 
I am however, particularly concerned about several provisions included in the bill. The first is the impact of increasing the Medicare eligibility age to 67. This provision will have a negative effect on millions of Americans. Many businesses and employees plan their retirement and health coverage around eligibility for Medicare. Increasing the age to qualify will exacerbate the existing problem of being uninsured among people age 55 to 65. Given our goal during this Congress of increasing health coverage for vulnerable populations--through the kids health care and allowing the disabled to buy into Medicaid--this provision moves in the wrong direction. 
Similarly, the proposed fourfold increase in the Medicare deductible for some beneficiaries is particularly problematic. I voted against this provision in the Finance Committee because I do not think the issue was sufficiently considered nor were we given the kind of impact analysis that is essential before making a decision of such magnitude. Such a significant increase in the deductible is essentially a tax on the sickest seniors. Those people who have to use the doctor more are the only ones who will incur the increased costs. Any deterred 
utilization of services will likely be the result of a senior deciding between needed health services or other expenses that must come from their fixed income. 
Furthermore, we have to be careful before preceding down this road. Means testing stands to erode support for the Medicare Program. We all have witnessed the backlash against so called welfare programs over the past 2 years. We must not allow Medicare to become regarded as transfer program solely for the poor. Americans pay into Medicare and expect to have the insurance when they retire. We already make wealthier Americans pay more in Medicare payroll taxes. It does not seem appropriate to be so hasty in increasing their cost-sharing obligations for the program as well. 
I also think that the Finance Committee went too far in its zeal to increase managed care enrollment in rural areas. This by no means suggest that I do not support enhanced managed care in rural areas--the majority of my State is rural. However, essentially freezing payment rates in high cost area, which coincidentally also have the overwhelming majority of existing managed care enrollment, in order to increase payment rates in rural areas may have the reverse effect. The committee bill contains so many incentives for rural areas that we may erode existing managed care enrollment and extra benefits that many health plans offer like prescription drugs and eye glasses. I hope that a more appropriate balance between encouraging managed care in underserved areas and maintaining existing enrollment can be achieve in the conference with the House. 
On the other hand, there are a number of good aspects of this legislation. Increased choice for Medicare beneficiaries through the development of Provider Sponsored Organizations and the removal of teen parents from the limit on vocational education under the welfare program are just two example of very meaningful policy changes included in this bill. Removing teen parents from the vocational education limit will facilitate states' promotion of education for 240,000 additional individuals as a means of moving permanently from welfare to work. 
The legislation would also cover diabetes self management training, colorectal cancer screenings, and mammography screens without copayment obligations. This investment in mammograms without a copayment obligations will benefit over 2 million women. Mr. President, S. 947 protects the vitally important Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment [EPSDT] benefits for children under Medicaid. Despite requests from Governors to diminish the benefit package for children, this bill does not allow it to occur. Similarly, the legislation protects disproportionate share funding for those hospitals that treat large volumes of indigent patients and are overly burdened by uncompensated care. 
I am certain that members on both sides of the aisle believe that this bill can be improved and there are a number of proposed amendments to do so; a number of which I plan to support. I hope that this body can get through this process in the same bipartisan fashion displayed in the Finance Committee. Chairman Roth said it best both in the Committee and on the Senate floor, that no one got everything but everyone got something that they wanted in this bill. That I believe, is the true mark of legislation through consensus. 
As I said at the outset, this bill takes several steps in the right direction--the direction of a balanced budget. However, Congress must not only look at the 5 and 10 year effect of the policies we enact or rest on the laurels this package. We need to look to the future and continue to reform programs in a fashion that maintain a balanced budget. The worse thing that we could do is not act again for another 60 years. Long-range economic forecasts are notoriously unreliable, but our long-range demographic changes are a reality that cannot be ignored. The retiring baby-boom generation will place considerable strain on our public systems. This budget bill only extends Medicare solvency through 2007--not even to the point at which the baby-boomers begin to retire. The longer we wait to enact more substantive program changes, the greater the threat to the viability of the Medicare Program. 
Our actions now will impact future generations--our grandchildren and great grandchildren. We have to remind ourselves to look beyond the next 5 to 10 years. I am not suggesting that we not celebrate being on the brink of a victory--balancing the budget for the first time in 60 years. I am simply stressing that Congress cannot retreat from its commitment to ensuring that future generations will have at least the same opportunity as we and our parents. Our generation should not leave no less than we inherited.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to salute six outstanding young women who were honored on May 12, 1997, with the Girl Scout Gold Award by the Dupage County Girl Scout Council of Naperville, IL. The Girl Scout Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the area of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal planning. I commend these young women for their dedication to our community. 
Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., an organization serving over 2.5 million girls, has awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Awards to senior Girl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the award, a Girl Scout must earn four interest project patches. The Career Exploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and the Senior Girl Scout Challenge. The Scout must also design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award project. A plan for fulfilling these requirements is created by the senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close cooperation between the girl and an adult volunteer. These objectives are met only through hard work and discipline, as displayed by the six young women honored on May 12. 
A member of Girl Scout Troop 936, Jennifer Gary began working toward the Girl Scout Gold Award in 1994. Her project, focused on providing a Costa Rican culture experience for people in her community and raised community awareness about the importance of rain forests to our global environment. 
The environment was also the focus of Carla Dingler's project. Carla, a member of Girl Scout Troop 167, coordinated six different environmental cleanups in her community. 
Cyndie Bagarie, an individual Girl Member, completed an innovative project she began working on in 1995. Cyndie created a raffle-like event, whereby members of the community were given the opportunity to win free swim lessons from Cyndie by donating food to a local food pantry. 
Girl Scout Troop 42 member Susan Mickelson created and distributed a wallet-size index of public phone numbers for teens. This arduous project began in 1993. 
Another member of Troop 42, Erin Kraatz, knitted teddy bears for the children residing at a local women's shelter. This ongoing project started in 1993. 
Jennifer Buhrow, an individual girl member, began working toward the Girl Scout Award in 1995. Her project consisted of collecting books, toys, games, and school supplies for the children at a local women's shelter. 
At a time when our Nation's youth face so many obstacles, it is encouraging to see six young women devoted to fostering an understanding between cultures and people, and taking steps to bring issues of importance to the attention of others. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Jennifer Gary, Carla Dingler, Cyndie Bagarie, Susan Mickelson, Erin Kraatz, and Jennifer Buhrow as they are recognized for their hard work and service to the community. We can all take pride in the fact that these six young women have made vital contributions to the State of Illinois. The people of Illinois are grateful for their contributions as public servants.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution to commemorate `Juneteenth Independence Day,' June 19, 1865, the true independence day of African-Americans. Juneteenth is one of the oldest black celebrations in America. It celebrates the day on which the last known slaves in America finally were freed. 
Although slavery was abolished throughout the United States with President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and the passage of the 13th amendment in 1863, the proclamation was only enforced in Confederate States under the control of the Union Army. Enforcement began nationwide when Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered on behalf of the Confederate States at Appomattox to end the Civil War on April 9, 1865. 
At the end of the war, 2 1/2 years after Lincoln's proclamation, the message of emancipation was spread throughout the South and Southwest by Union soldiers who were sent to enforce the freeing of the slaves. 
The last slaves were freed on June 19, 1865, 65 days after Lincoln had been assassinated, when Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, TX with a regiment of Union soldiers, declaring that Texas' 250,000 slaves were freed. To commemorate that day, the former slaves dubbed that June 19th day `Juneteenth.' 
African-Americans who had been slaves celebrated that day as the anniversary of their emancipation. For more than 130 years this tradition has been passed on generation to generation as a day to honor the memory of those who endured slavery and those who moved from slavery to freedom. 
While the significance of this day originated in the Southwest, this celebration soon spread to other States. There are now Juneteenth celebrations across the country. In fact, the Bloomington/Normal Black History Project and Cultural Consortium in Bloomington/Normal, IL will celebrate Juneteenth this week. 
Juneteenth celebrations commemorate the faith and strength of the many generations of African-Americans who suffered and endured the chattels of slavery. The annual observance of Juneteenth Independence Day will provide an opportunity for all Americans to learn more about our common past and to better understand the experiences that have shaped our Nation. 
I urge all Americans to celebrate Juneteenth and to reflect upon not only the end of a painful chapter in American history, but also the triumph of unity and freedom in America.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Play Act, legislation that builds upon the extraordinary success of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and promotes the continued expansion of athletic opportunities available to women at institutions of higher education. I want to thank my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, for their help in writing this bill. 
Twenty-five years ago, President Nixon signed title IX into law and ushered in a new era of opportunity for American women and girls. Prior to the enactment of title IX, fewer than 32,000 women competed in intercollegiate athletics, women received only 2 percent of schools' athletic budgets, and athletic scholarships for women were practically nonexistent. 
Today, because of title IX, more than 110,000 women compete in intercollegiate athletics and women account for 37 percent of college varsity athletes. Last year at the 1996 Olympic games, American women won gold medals in basketball, soccer, softball, swimming, track and field, gymnastics, and other sports. This Saturday, the first season of the WNBA will debut on network television, and it is my understanding that advertisers have already filled every minute of commercial time for the entire WNBA season. Without title IX, none of this would have been possible. From the professional level to intercollegiate competition to local high school soccer fields, women's athletics have captured the hearts and attention of millions of Americans. 
But the athletic opportunities created by title IX have contributed more than just winning teams and great female athletes. We all know that sports promotes better physical health. Science has shown us, however, that female athletes also have better mental health, emotional health, self-confidence, discipline, and higher academic achievement. Female athletes are more likely to go to and stay in college than their nonathletic peers. Female athletes are less likely to drop out of school, and are more likely to achieve higher marks in their academic classes. Athletics are an integral part of education and health, for men as well as for women. 
In addition, the addition of women's varsity sports at colleges and universities has led to the creation of women's athletic scholarships. These scholarships translate directly into opportunities to go to college. Indeed, in this era when the cost of college is rising three times as fast as household income, athletic scholarships can literally mean the difference between going to college and not going to college. Title IX has brought these opportunities within reach of millions of American girls and women. 
Despite the extraordinary success of title IX, however, there remains a significant gap 
between the athletic opportunities available to college-age women and men. While women represent 53 percent of students, they make up only 37 percent of student athletes. According to a recent NCAA study, female college athletes receive only 23 percent of athletic operating budgets, 38 percent of athletic scholarship dollars, and 27 percent of the money spent to recruit new athletes. The President's Council on Physical Fitness recently noted, `The face of sex discrimination in athletics has changed. It [is] often no longer the purposeful exclusion of the past, but a collection of more subtle inequities that could be explained away by a lack of resources.' 
The fact is, most colleges and universities do not provide their female students with athletic opportunities comparable to those they offer to their male students. According to a recent USA Today survey of NCAA division I-A schools, only 9 percent of the 303 schools surveyed have roughly proportionate numbers of female and male athletes. 
Title IX does not, in fact, as some people believe, require schools to devote half their athletic resources to women, or equalize the number of male and female athletes. Title IX does require, however, that colleges at least make a continued effort to expand their athletics programs to fully accommodate the interests of both sexes. In order to monitor this progress and title IX compliance, colleges and universities are required to collect information about their men's and women's athletic programs, including participation rates, operating and recruitment budgets, the availability of scholarships, revenues generated from athletic programs, and coaches' salaries, and are required to make this information available upon request. There is not, however, any mechanism for the collection and distribution of this important information, and the Department of Education does not have ready access to all of this information to assist in its enforcement of title IX. 
The Fair Play Act directs colleges and universities to send this information, which they already compile annually, to the Department of Education. The bill therefore imposes no additional burden on colleges and universities. The bill directs the Department to issue an annual report and make the information available through a variety of mechanisms, including the Department's World Wide Web site and a toll-free number people to provide easy access to the information reported by schools, as well as information about title IX. 
The Fair Play Act will provide prospective students and prospective student athletes with the kind of information they need to make informed decisions about where to go to school. It will give the Department of Education valuable information it needs to aid its enforcement of title IX in the area of athletics, and it will encourage schools to continue to expand the athletic programs to meet the interests of women nationwide. This legislation is the logical next step in the continuing effort to expand athletic opportunities available to women. 
Over its 25 year history, title IX has been directly responsible for expanding the athletic opportunities available to millions of women and girls. The Fair Play Act will build on this legacy of success, and provide the information needed to ensure that the expansion of athletic opportunities available to women continues into the 21st century.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank my colleague from Illinois. I just want to say that the Chicago Bulls have been such a source of joy to those of us from Illinois. But also, because of their longstanding pursuit of excellence and demonstration of excellence, they have become America's team. I don't think there is a single team in this country that can boast 5 years of National Basketball Association championships. We won in 1991 against the Lakers; in 1992, against the Trailblazers; in 1993, against the Suns; in 1996 against the Supersonics; and, of course, recently, against the Jazz. 
It has been done because the players on the Chicago Bulls are--in the terms of a great football coach from our town--`Grabowski's.' `Grabowski's' are people who work hard and keep focused and give it their all and their best, even under adverse circumstances. Certainly, that is what this team has proved over and over again that they can do. They can win, whether it is at the old Chicago Stadium, in L.A., in Phoenix, or in the new United Center. It doesn't matter where they play. They bring the same values, talent, and, most important, the same heart to the game. That is why they are world champions. That is why they are America's team. 
Of course, in this last game Steve Kerr can distinguish himself with the 17-foot jumper, which was what some might call the `Hail Mary' play. You just held your breath while it was going on. He drew on the spirit of John Paxon and made the game-winning play toward the end of the game. But he could not do it alone; it was a team effort. 
My colleague pointed to the special relationship between Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, two very unique, very special players. I think it can go without saying that Michael Jordan is the greatest player in the history of basketball, and we are really fortunate to have him as a leader of this team. 
In terms of leadership, certainly Coach Phil Jackson gets high marks for the kind of calm, deliberative, thoughtful approach he brings to the game, which is more than just a sport. It really is an exercise and demonstration of human spirit and values that takes place out on the basketball court. 
I have a special place in my heart for Jerry Reinsdorf, who recently worked out a situation in correcting an injustice. He single-handedly was able to encourage the baseball owners to award pensions to the players of the old Negro League that had been denied pensions, because when they went to the majors, there wasn't enough time to qualify for pensions. At my request, he took that issue up and took it to the owners and, after all these years, they have awarded pensions to those old baseball players. Jerry Reinsdorf, I think, demonstrates the best in sports and sports owners. Again, I know he has every reason to be as proud of this team, as we all are. 
At the same time, I think it must be said that the Utah Jazz played a phenomenal game. They were a dignified team, a disciplined team. Karl Malone and John Stockton were the equivalent of Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan, in a way, from another part of the country. They distinguished themselves in the gentlemanly way in which they handled themselves throughout the series. Utah has nothing to be ashamed of. If anything, they have everything to be proud of in the kind of game they played in the championship competition in which they engaged. They supported themselves very well. Utah and the rest of the country can be proud of them as well. Their coach, I think, has a great future. Working with that team, he has a lot of good material to work with there. 
As my colleague pointed out, we are not satisfied with number 5. Grabowski's always want to do better, and we are looking for the six pack, or No. 6, next year. I want to thank the Chair for this opportunity to commend the team and all the players. It is a team sport by definition. It doesn't happen just because we have superstars. They are all stars and they are all great. We are so proud of them, and our country has every reason to be proud of America's basketball team.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Banking Committee, on which I serve, has come to an agreement on the Riegle-Neal clarifications bill. This legislation provides legal certainty for banks and bank supervisors regarding the Riegle-Neal interstate banking law passed in 1994. The Congress passed the Interstate banking law to end the patchwork of laws that had arisen in this area, and to provide for an efficient system for banks to operate in more than one State. It was legislation that was badly needed and long overdue, given the huge changes that have been ongoing in our economy generally, and in the financial services area, specifically. 
However, some confusion remains regarding the application of home State law versus the application of host State law to a State-chartered bank that branches outside its home State. Although the 1994 law clearly reserved the areas of intrastate branching, community reinvestment, consumer protection, and fair lending for host State jurisdiction, the extent to which other host State laws applied to an out-of-state state chartered bank remained ambiguous. State-chartered banks wanting to expand across State lines have faced legal uncertainty about what law governs their powers outside their home State, and many were contemplating switching to a national charter in order to gain that certainty. This bill, the Riegle-Neal Clarification Act of 1997, eliminates that ambiguity, ensuring the viability of our dual banking system by clearly stating that host State law applies to branches of State-chartered banks only to the extent that it applies to national bank branches. 
This bill levels the playing field between State-chartered banks and national chartered banks that branch across State lines. It is important to the preservation of a strong, State-chartered banking system, which benefits the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole. I wish to commend my colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee who have worked hard on this agreement and I urge swift passage of the bill.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate my colleague, the Senator from New York, Senator D'Amato, for his leadership on this bill, the Fair ATM Fees for Consumers Act. 
Few Americans will quarrel with the issue this bill addresses: surcharging, or double charging consumers for a single ATM transaction, is unfair and unnecessary. 
Many banks charge their customers for using foreign ATM's--those ATM's not owned by the customer's bank. These fees are disclosed to the customer in advance, allowing consumers to shop for and choose banks that offer the best package of services at the best price. 
I don't have a problem with that kind of fee. Customers have that information well in advance, and at a time they can use it. If the services offered by banks fail to meet the customer's satisfaction, customers can take their business elsewhere. 
Surcharging, however, undermines all that. Last April, the major computer networks allowed ATM owners to begin charging fees to customers using foreign ATM's. From that day, the floodgates opened, and now customers nationwide are being charged twice for the same transaction--first by their own institution, and by the institution owning the ATM machine. 
These costs are spreading. According to a recent General Accounting Office report commissioned by the Senator from New York, ATM surcharges have ballooned 320 percent since 1995. 
One example of the surcharge boom is in my hometown of Chicago. Earlier this month, First Chicago NBD instituted surcharges, affecting 710 ATM's in the area. That decision, coupled with the 1,550 ATM's in the region already levying surcharges, now means that more than half of the 4,400 ATM's in the Chicago area have a surcharge. 
Mr. President, if current trends continue, few ATM's will remain that have no surcharge, and consumers, despite surcharge warnings posted on the computer screen or on the machine, will truly have no alternative but to be charged twice for the same transaction. 
I am aware that there are some costs to convenience. There are more than 122,000 ATM's around the Nation, almost 5 times the number in place a decade ago. Americans used ATM machines more than 9 billion times last year, accessing their bank accounts and other financial services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I know there are costs associated with deploying these new machines, handling increased transactions, and other maintenance and safety issues. 
It should not be forgotten, however, that banks moved customers to ATM's because, compared to teller transactions, ATM's were cheaper. According to a Mentis Corp. study, an ATM cash withdrawal from an in-branch ATM costs an average of 22 to 28 cents, while the cost of a teller transaction is 90 cents to $1.15. And in some cases, banks charge customers for completing transactions with a teller if those transactions could have been completed at an ATM. 
Certainly ATM's are a convenience for customers, but the truth is that banks have deployed more ATM's because it means lower costs to banks. 
I remember when banks paid their customers for the use of their money. Today, however, it's increasingly expensive for the average working family to manage even a simple banking account. Americans who make timely credit card payments, or no payments at all, face higher fees. Americans who avoid special banking services are considered unprofitable customers, and face higher fees. 
Now, with ATM surcharges, Americans are discovering that they must pay banks an additional $155 each year simply to access their own money. 
The market is out of whack. The pubic knows this is unfair, and their visceral reaction is a response to market excess. 
I am hopeful that the financial industry will take the necessary steps to remedy this problem. Otherwise, the Government has a duty to correct the abuse of double and triple charging people for accessing their own hard-earned dollars. 
It is time to stop nickel and diming the American pocket. That's why I'm pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I urge its swift approval by the U.S. Senate.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to introduce the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act of 1997. 
The Underground Railroad, as my colleagues know, was among the most successful efforts in history in helping to undermine and destroy the institution of slavery in the United States. Beginning during the colonial period, this clandestine resistance movement reached its peak in the 19th century, helping hundreds of thousands of African-Americans flee servitude in the South and begin new lives in the North, and in Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. 
Despite its historical significance, the Underground Railroad has not been officially recognized in any fashion. Consequently, in 1990, my distinguished former colleague, Senator Paul Simon, and former Congressman Pete Kostmayer of Pennsylvania, introduced legislation directing the National Park Service to explore and study options for commemorating the Underground Railroad. Congress passed that legislation later that year, and the National Park Service went to work gathering information on the routes and sites used by the Underground Railroad. 
That study, completed in 1996, found that the Underground Railroad story was of national significance. The study documented over 380 sites, including 27 national park units, national historic landmarks, routes, privately owned buildings, and churches associated with this resistance movement. The study also found that many of these sites were in imminent danger of being lost or destroyed, and that despite a tremendous amount of interest in the Underground Railroad, little organized coordination and communication existed among interested individuals and organizations. The study reached a final recommendation that the U.S. Congress should authorize and fund a national initiative to support, preserve, and commemorate the sites and routes associated with the Underground Railroad. 
Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today, along with my distinguished colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, will enact many of the findings of that National Park Service study into law. Our bill, the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act, will create within the National Park Service a nationwide network of historic buildings, routes, programs, projects, and museums that have certifiable thematic connections to the Underground Railroad. The bill will also allow the National Park Service to produce and disseminate educational and informational materials on the Underground Railroad, and enter into cooperative agreements with Federal agencies, State and local government, and historical societies to provide technical assistance and coordination among network participants. Participation in the network by private property owners is purely voluntary. 
This bill does not create a new park unit in the traditional sense. In order to ensure the maximum safety and secrecy of its activities, the Underground Railroad was an amorphous and loosely organized system. No single site or route, therefore, completely characterizes the Underground Railroad, making it unfeasible that these sites could have boundaries and be operated as a traditional national park. Instead, it is the intent of this bill to create a network of cooperative partnerships, identified by an official or unifying symbol or device, at a limited annual operating cost. 
Mr. President, we will never know how many individuals were freed from servitude, or how many Americans, black and white, women and men, mayors, ministers, businessmen, housewives, or former slaves endangered or sacrificed their lives in the defense of the belief that no American, and no human, should be bought, traded, or sold. 
That's why I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass the Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act. This bill grants Federal recognition to the Underground Railroad as a significant aspect of American history. This bill helps to preserve the structures and artifacts of an organized resistance movement for freedom. And finally, and most important, this bill commemorates those Americans whose efforts helped destroy the ugly legacy of slavery in this country.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, our Nation benefits when every citizen has the opportunity to contribute to the best of his or her ability to the economy, to the society, and to the country. Discrimination, in any form, prevents the utilization of all available talents and makes our future less bright than it could be--less bright than it should be. It is for this reason that I join my colleagues, Senator Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Lieberman, in cosponsoring the Employment Non-Discrimination Act [ENDA]. 
The Employment Non-Discrimination Act prohibits employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. It creates no special rights, or quotas, it merely ensures that gay and lesbian Americans have the same rights as every other American in the workplace. 
Employment discrimination impedes economic competitiveness, frustrates fairness, and obstructs opportunity. 
Employment discrimination impedes economic competitiveness for America's businesses. Our work force is what makes America strong. Discrimination only serves to lessen that strength. Many companies have already adopted their own antidiscrimination policies, recognizing the negative impact discrimination can have on their continuing competitiveness. These businesses understand that there is no place for discrimination as we transition into the 21st century's global workplace. 
Unfortunately, not all businesses understand this yet, and in 39 States, employment discrimination based on sexual orientation is still legal. There are many documented cases 
highlighting the fact that discrimination in the workplace still occurs. Without national legislation to protect all Americans, cases of discrimination against gay men and lesbian women will continue to occur unchallenged and businesses, and thus our national economy, will continue to suffer. 
Employment discrimination is fundamentally unfair. Each of us should be allowed to fully participate in society, regardless of our gender, race, or sexual orientation. ENDA prohibits giving preferential treatment to any individual based on sexual orientation. Employers may not provide special treatment to gay men, lesbians, or heterosexuals. The bill provides that an employer may not use the fact of an individual's sexual orientation as the basis for positive or negative action against that individual in employment opportunities. Americans should not be promoted, nor should they be held back, by conditions that have nothing to do with merit, or talents and abilities. 
Employment discrimination obstructs opportunity for America's workers. If there is any objective that should command complete American consensus, it is ensuring that every American has the chance to succeed--and that, in the final analysis, is what this bill is about. No issue is more critical to our country, and nothing makes a bigger difference in a person's life than opening up opportunities. 
The basic principle we should keep in mind is that every American must have the opportunity to advance as far in their field as their hard work will take them. That is the American way. Gay and lesbian Americans should not have to face discrimination in the workplace, should not face dismissal, be denied promotions, or experience harassment, simply because of their sexual orientation. 
In endorsing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in the 104th Congress the American Bar Association wrote: 
Over the years, and with some struggle, this nation has extended employment discrimination protection to individuals on the basis of race, religion, gender, national origin, age, and disability. ENDA takes the next necessary step by extending this same basic protection to another group that has been vilified and victimized--gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals. All workers, regardless of their sexual orientation, are entitled to be judged on the strength of the work they do; they should not be deprived of their livelihood because of the prejudice of others. 
This is an eloquent statement of one of the fundamental tenets of the United States of America--equal opportunity for all. This Nation was founded by people fleeing prejudice and discrimination. ENDA continues that legacy. 
As a matter of fundamental fairness and because all workers should be entitled to legal protection and opportunity in the work force, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today I would like to offer my most heartfelt condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of John Sengstacke, Chicago Defender publisher and owner, a Chicago native. 
Mr. Sengstacke was a man of vision, who promoted and created opportunities through his words and his actions. He was a person who valued commitment, always urging others to follow through. Under his tutelage, the Chicago Defender became one of the most widely read, informative, and important, independent newspapers for countless Chicagoans. 
His was a courageous life, and he always took a stand against segregation and discrimination, always fought to give a voice to the voiceless. Most notable are his efforts as a member of Truman's committee to desegregate the military and his vigilant effort to get the first African-American correspondent into the White House. 
He was clear that his role was not only to inform but to educate, by both his personal and professional actions. 
John Sengstacke knew the power of the pen was one of the strongest weapons available to African-Americans. He worked tirelessly to get the National Newspaper Publisher's Association established, and it became an organization that would help more than 200 African-American-owned newspapers provide a voice for the African-American community. 
We have truly lost one of our finest freedom fighters, but he left a legacy of tenacity and resilience that will endure. 
We have much to celebrate in remembering the life of John Sengstacke. I thank John for his friendship, and thank him for blessing us with his legacy.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to congratulate Msgr. Kenneth Velo, president of the Catholic Church Extension Society and priest of the Archdiocese of Chicago, as the Joint Civic Committee of Italian Americans honors him on June 7, 1997 as the recipient of the Joseph Cardinal Bernardin Humanitarian of the Year Award. 
Monsignor Velo, who was born on Chicago's south side, was ordained as a Catholic priest in May 1973, after attending St. Mary of the Lake Seminary in Mundelein, IL. Monsignor Velo served as associate pastor of St. Angela Parish in Chicago from 1973 to 1980 and as associate pastor of Queen of All Saints Basilica from 1980 to 1981. In 1981, he assisted the Archdiocese of Chicago as assistant chancellor, and from 1983 to 1985 served as vice-chancellor of the Archdiocese of Chicago. 
Known for his ability to remember not only names and faces, but the circumstances of the people he encountered, Monsignor Velo was asked by the late Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, Archbishop of Chicago, to serve as the Cardinal's executive assistant in 1985. Monsignor Velo would serve the Cardinal in this capacity for 14 years. Monsignor Velo was, at times, the Cardinal's sounding board, driver, eyes and ears. Ultimately, it would be Monsignor Velo who would orchestrate Cardinal Bernardin's death rites and care for the Cardinal's mother after his death. No one will ever forget the powerful and moving eulogy the Monsignor delivered in memory of his friend. 
In 1994 Pope John Paul II, moved by his reputation as a public servant, appointed Monsignor Velo to be President of the Catholic Church Extension Society, a national philanthropic organization that has helped isolated and impoverished missions throughout the United States since 1905. As president of the Catholic Church Extension Society, Monsignor Velo has only reaffirmed his reputation as an individual dedicated to helping others. 
Monsignor Velo is a true humanitarian. Today, I extend my sincere congratulations to Monsignor Velo for receiving the Joseph Cardinal Bernardin Humanitarian of the Year Award. Through his extraordinary personal effort for the betterment of our community, Monsignor Velo truly has personified the humanitarian nature of Joseph Cardinal Bernardin. I am proud to join the Joint Civic Committee of Italian Americans in recognizing Monsignor Velo's achievements.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of Jewel S. Lafontant-Mankarious. I especially want to convey my most heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious's son and my dear friend, John Rogers. 
On Saturday, May 31, 1997, our Nation lost one of our finest citizens. Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious, a native of my hometown Chicago, will be remembered by many as a courageous woman who broke barriers for African-American women in law and government. 
Jewel Lafontant-Mankarious was born of a distinguished family of African-American professionals and leaders, who had a long history of American patriotism. It was only natural that she would want to follow in this tradition of leadership. Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious' desires led her to pursue an undergraduate degree in political science at Oberlin College, and later a law degree from the University of Chicago, where she graduated in 1946. Due to the level of institutional racism and sexism that existed in the legal field at that time, however, Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious found herself unable to secure a job in a major firm, obtain office space in the downtown area, or even join the Chicago Bar Association. Mrs. Lafontant-Markarious was resilient, however, and would later rise to become a senior partner in the firm of Stradford, Lafontant, Gibson, Fisher & Cousins, senior legal partner at Vedder, Price, Kaufman & Kammholz, and a partner in the law firm of Holleb & Collef. Just this past year, in fact, Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious was cited as one of the top female attorneys in the city of Chicago. 
Her success never interfered with her commitment to public service. Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious, has been remembered as `a regal woman, a person of the highest integrity,' who `gave her legal services to the downtrodden people who couldn't fight for themselves.' 
It was this sense of fairness that led Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious in her other endeavors. A longtime civil rights activist, Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious was a founding member of the Congress for Racial Equality, held office in the Chicago chapter of the NAACP, and was on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union. In this capacity she is remembered for showing the same sort of tenacity and resilience that brought her success in her legal career, and is known for using innovative, yet peaceful, methods to bring about change. In later years, Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious would continue to be active in countless civic endeavors, using her influence and her legal skills to help African-American entrepreneurs. 
Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious' activism was consistent and tenacious. She not only fought for the rights of African-Americans during the civil rights era, but fought to ensure that women, in particular, had a voice. In fact, by 1969, at a time when very few women had any real power in the corporate world, Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious sat on the boards of 15 major corporations, including TWA and Mobile Oil. She elegantly broke barriers of both race and gender in all of her endeavors. 
Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious was extremely active in Republican politics. A close friend of Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon, and Bush, Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious served as the first African-American woman to hold the position of assistant U.S. attorney during the Eisenhower administration. In 1972, Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious became the highest female appointee named in the second Nixon administration, when she was selected as Deputy Solicitor General in the Justice Department. Years later, during the Bush administration, she would serve as U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for 4 years, visiting 28 countries. President Bush also appointed her to serve as Coordinator for Refugee Affairs for the State Department. 
We should all be proud of the life that Mrs. Jewel S. Lafontant-Mankarious led. She was a woman of integrity, valor, and achievement, and was a personal heroine and role model to me. She rose above adversity, used her God-given talents to fight for the rights of others, and served as an example for following generations of what a strong heart and mind can achieve. Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious will be sorely missed by all Americans who believe in the value of a true democratic society, who oppose discrimination, and who support the notion that we can all serve the good of humanity. 
Today, I salute Jewel S. Lafontant-Mankarious for her many achievements, and thank her for her legacy.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Maurice Sorrell, the dean of black photojournalists, as colleagues, friends, and family gather to celebrate his retirement from a lifelong commitment to capturing history on film. 
Mr. Sorrell, a D.C. native, first noticed his love for photography as a youngster, when he often watched his uncles taking amateur pictures of his parents. His first job in photography was at the Pentagon in the 1950's, where he was permitted to work only in the darkroom because of racial segregation policies that existed. In 1957, Mr. Sorrell decided to strike out on his own as a freelance photographer. It was in this capacity that Mr. Sorrell served the Afro-American Newspapers and the Washington Afro-American Newspaper. 
In 1962, Mr. Sorrell joined Johnson Publishing Co., Inc., as a staff photographer. Mr. Sorrell's artistic but honest portrayal of most civil rights events, as well as other issues of importance to the African-American community, has made him a landmark figure at Johnson Publishing Co., Inc. For the past 35 years, his work has appeared regularly in Ebony and Jet magazines. In addition to having received numerous awards and citations, Mr. Sorrell has earned a reputation among his colleagues for being a truly gifted photographer, with a unique eye for capturing the essence of the moment with a single portrait. 
Among his many firsts, Mr. Sorrell has the distinction of being the first African-American to gain admittance in the prestigious White House News Photographers Association in 1961, as well as the honor of being the photographer who took the first group photo of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
Over the course of his extensive career, Mr. Sorrell has visited more than 24 countries, covered nine presidents, photographed the March to Selma, AL, with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., shot the World Series and NFL games, and covered many other events. His work has gained him the confidence of some of our Nation's most memorable and influential people. 
Maurice Sorrell is truly an American legend. Today, I commend him for his accomplishments, and applaud his contributions to the field of photography. Through his dedication to his art, and by his desire to capture our Nation's history on film, he has touched the lives of countless Americans.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, it is indeed my pleasure and privilege to join the family and friends of a distinguished citizen of Chicago, IL, Mrs. Helen Maybell Anglin, in celebrating her 50th anniversary in the restaurant business. Mrs. Anglin has always held that the `good things in life ought to be enjoyed by all people, especially good food.' As owner and manager of the Soul Queen Restaurant, a popular soul food eatery located on the Windy City's Southside, Mrs. Anglin works her special magic to turn simple, down home fare into something spectacular. 
Aside from being a local legend, Mrs. Anglin has been nationally recognized for her culinary talents. Her recipes have been published in numerous sources, including the Ladies Home Journal. She has also appeared on local and national television programs, including the Oprah Winfrey Show, to demonstrate her masterful cooking techniques. Throughout her career, Mrs. Anglin has been instrumental in exposing the public-at-large to delicious soul food cuisine. 
In addition to being a successful restauranteur, Mrs. Anglin has been a committed civic leader for decades. She is one of the original board members of the PUSH Foundation and has been an active supporter of the NAACP, the League of Black Women Voters, and the United Negro College Fund. She is well known for inspiring young people to maximize their educational opportunities and has provided financial assistance to help many achieve their goals. 
Mrs. Anglin combines her private passion for good food with her public commitment to the common good. Her community work and civil rights advocacy represent a singular distinction for this woman of and for the people. She has distinguished herself as one of Chicago's most valuable leaders through her extraordinary talent, innovation, and compassion. Her achievements and dedication to quality in all her endeavors are a shining example to us all, and I am honored to know her.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Madam President, I rise to make brief statements concerning two of my amendments to the congressional budget resolution that the Members on both sides of the aisle have agreed to support. 
These two amendments are of vital importance. They concern the value of the Social Security program and the use of budget savings in the mandatory spending areas. These are vitally important amendments because they relate to that important issue of retirement security that should be a part of any discussions about the Federal budget. 
The first amendment, which is amendment No. 333, expresses a sense of the Senate that the budget savings in the mandatory spending areas contained in this budget resolution should be used:  
to protect and enhance the retirement security of the American people by ensuring the long-term future of the social security system; 
to protect and enhance the health care security of senior citizens by ensuring the long-term future of the Medicare program and, 
to restore and maintain Federal budget discipline to ensure that the level of private investment necessary for long-term economic growth and prosperity is available. 
Mr. President, this amendment is important because: 
twenty-two percent of every dollar spent by the federal government goes to the social security program, 
another eleven percent of every dollar spent by the federal government goes to the Medicare program, 
currently, spending on the elderly accounts for a third of the federal budget, and 
while the federal budget deficit has dropped for the fourth straight year to $67 billion in 1997, measures need to be taken to ensure that this trend continues. 
I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted this amendment and once again, reaffirmed our commitment to protecting Americans' retirement security and also reducing the deficit. 
My second amendment, which is amendment No. 334, is one about which I know many Members of this body are also concerned. It has to do with the value of the Social Security program. I have begun to hold forums in my State as a means of starting the dialog with my constituents about the future of Social Security. I know that other Members have held similar forums in their States as well. 
The amendment simply expresses the sense of the Senate that the budget resolution does not assume any legislative changes that would reduce the value of the Social Security program for future generations of retired citizens. This is an important amendment because we have an obligation to ensure that this program which has allowed a generation of Americans to retire with dignity must be preserved. 
Madam President, a few facts will highlight the importance of the Social Security program to Americans. 
First, 13 percent of the population is over age 65 and that percentage will increase to over 20 percent of the population by 2030; 
Social Security provides over 80 percent of retirement income for 60 percent of seniors; 
More than half of all senior citizens do not receive any private pension income; 
Poverty rates among the elderly are at the lowest levels since we began collecting the data due in a large part to Social Security; and 
Finally, the average Americans retiring in 2015 will have paid $250,000 in payroll taxes during their working career. 
There is no question that current retirees rely heavily upon Social Security and future retirees expect the value of the program not to be diminished when they need it. Therefore, I am again happy that my colleagues support this amendment. I think we can all agree that we must protect the value of the Social Security program for future generations of Americans.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the blueprint our nation will follow to reach fiscal balance by the year 2002. I commend the efforts of the President and the Congressional leadership to reach this agreement. It is clear that unless we get our deficit under control, we will be leaving our children--and our children's children--a legacy of debt that will make it impossible for them to achieve the American Dream. 
This budget resolution reflects public opinion. This is a bipartisan agreement because of clear public opposition to continued deficit spending. 
Although the deficit has been reduced in the past few years, our Nation's debt still obscures our ability to focus on the issues that most impact Americans' daily lives. The deficit under President Carter was $73.8 billion when he left office. Under President Reagan it ballooned to $221 billion, and reached $290 under President Bush. When President Clinton took office, he inherited a $290 billion deficit. The national family was in debt $4.4 trillion. 
Under President Clinton's leadership, however, the deficit has been reduced to $67 billion, the lowest nominal level since 1981. During the Bush administration, private sector growth averaged 1.3 percent annually, but under President Clinton, growth has averaged 3.5% per year. Furthermore, last year's deficit was 1.4 percent of the size of our economy, well below the deficits of other major economies, and the smallest level since 1974. This year, it will fall to about 1 percent of the economy. 
President Clinton's 1993 economic budget plan gave the signal to the world's financial markets that Democrats were committed to fiscal responsibility and that we would put our country on a glide path to balance. Our Nation is now in our 6th straight year of economic growth. Unemployment was 7.5 percent in 1992. Last month it fell to 4.9 percent, the lowest level in a quarter century. 
During the first quarter of this year, the economy grew at an annual rate of 5.6 percent, the best in a decade. And since President Clinton took office, more than 12 million new jobs have been created. 
The best news about this resolution is that it continues the trend begun in 1993: this budget makes strides toward balance. Balance was a precondition of this agreement. While I regret that we did not pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, the proof of the pudding is in the eating: the President and congressional leaders have reached a consensus and agreed that this budget should reach balance in the year 2002. And this budget has achieved that. 
Mr. President, an area where the nation has reached a consensus is tax cuts. Everybody likes tax cuts. Public opinion is always in favor of tax cuts and this budget resolution provides for a net tax cut of $85 billion over 5 years. 
The tax cuts include: a child tax cut; about $35 billion in higher education tax cuts; a capital gains tax cut; a cut in the estate tax; and a variety of other tax proposals included in the President's budget, including the welfare-to-work tax credit. 
But this budget resolution only outlines the overall framework of the budget. The tax cuts that were agreed upon must be finalized in reconciliation in the Finance Committee. But these are the likely ones. 
While I support the concept of these proposals, I would have preferred to finish balancing the budget first. 
Mr. President, the budget resolution also reflects the popular support for health care and Medicare. And the changes contained in the Medicare Program will not hurt seniors. 
The agreement calls for $115 billion in Medicare savings, keeping the Medicare trust fund secure for another decade. It expands seniors' choices of private health plans by allowing preferred provider organizations and provider-sponsored plans to compete in Medicare's managed care program. 
Furthermore, this agreement will make some fixes to the Medicaid Program. While the resolution does not contain a per-capita cap, which would have hurt Illinois, it calls for $13.6 billion in net Medicaid savings. It restores Medicaid coverage for certain legal 
immigrants. It provides food stamps to individuals subject to last year's welfare reform bill time limits, who are seeking work but have not been able to find a job. And it provides a welfare-to-work initiative. 
The other good news is that this budget also provides for: expansion of the funding for Superfund hazardous waste cleanups; help up for to five million children, who currently lack health insurance, receive health insurance coverage by 2002; and it provides for the largest increase in education spending in 30 years. 
This budget resolution does however, contain a few disappointments. It does not come to grips with the fundamental challenges our Nation faces in the coming years. Instead of confronting these challenges and taking steps to meet them, it is the budgetary equivalent of the scene from `Casablanca' when Claude Rains says `Round up the usual suspects.' In this case, the `usual suspects' are domestic discretionary spending and cuts in reimbursements for Medicare and Medicaid health providers. 
Like Captain Renault, this agreement is more concerned with the appearance of action than with actually achieving something. And unlike the situation in `Casablanca', where the captain's inaction produced a good result, the failure to address our fundamental retirement security and investment challenges now, makes the future more difficult for all of us. 
Since 1991, discretionary spending has remained relatively flat. While the President has resisted deeper cuts this year, this budget resolution nonetheless short-changes domestic spending. The agreement cuts investments in non-defense discretionary programs by at least $61 billion below the level needed to maintain the current level of services. This agreement represents roughly a 10 percent cut in real terms in non-defense discretionary programs. This translates into less money for cops on the streets, less money for sewers, and less money for our highways--fundamental public investments needed to keep our country strong. 
The squeeze is being put on discretionary funding to pay for tax cuts. Furthermore, nothing is being done to address entitlement spending. This budget resolution does nothing to address the ominous long-term issue facing our country: changing demographics and its effect on our ability to maintain retirement security for future generations. 
I was a member of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. The Commission made it clear that unless we get the deficit under control, by the year 2003, mandatory spending--most of which goes to Medicare and Social Security--plus interest on the national debt, will account for fully 73 percent of the total Federal budget. 
Though the current economic news is generally good, and the economy continues to expand, this trend may not continue. The Congressional Budget Office's report entitled `The Economic and Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years 1998-2007,' points out that `Despite the improved outlook through 2007 . . . the budget situation will start to deteriorate rapidly only a few years later with the retirement of the first baby boomers and the continued growth of per-person health care costs.' 
By the year 2012, the Social Security trust fund will begin spending more than it takes in. And by the year 2029, the trust fund will have exhausted all of its resources. After 2012, when there are no more surpluses, Federal deficits will really begin to explode, an explosion fueled by the looming retirement of the baby boom generation. 
The fact that for the next 15 years Social Security will be running a surplus, works to disguise the extent of the problem, as does the fact that the retirement security budget is currently roughly in balance. Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes, Medicare part B premiums, and interest earned by the Social Security and Medicare trust funds roughly equal the spending by those two programs, at least for the moment. 
The long-term prognosis, however is nowhere near as favorable and the problem with this budget resolution is that it does nothing to address these problems now, while there is still time. Granted, the proposed set of Medicare reductions will extend the solvency of the trust fund until 2008. There are also some true systematic reforms to the Medicare Program that will move many of the program features toward prospective payment systems. 
However, this is not nearly enough. This budget resolution does not even extend the Medicare Program solvency to the year 2010 when the baby-boom generation begins to retire. Think about this: Currently, 13 percent of the population is over age 65, and that number will 
double by the year 2030. The problem of fixing Medicare for the long run is only going to get more difficult. If we wait until the next millennium to deal with Medicare, it is going to take a lot more than $115 billion over five years to fix the problem. If we want Medicare to exist for our children and for many of us, we have to seize this opportunity to overhaul the program in a long-lasting way. 
Equally depressing is our complete ignoring of needed Social Security reform. There has been a lot of talk over the last few years about tax cuts and the need to give Americans some relief from the burden of excess taxation. As you may know, 70 percent of Americans pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes. The average worker retiring in 2015 will pay $250,000 in payroll taxes over her working career. 
People pay these taxes into a system that they believe will provide them with some measure of retirement security. They expect Medicare to be there to cover health care costs and they expect Social Security to be around to provide a measure of income support. Eighty percent of Americans get more than 50 percent of their retirement income from Social Security. 
The Social Security system, just like Medicare, is not prepared for our future changes in demographics. Current retirees can expect to get back in benefits what they paid in taxes plus interest within eight years. 
For the vast majority of past and current retirees, Social Security has been a great value. They paid into the system with the promise that when it was their turn to retire, Social Security would be there. Well, the outlook is not as good for future generations of retirees. Already, the probability of getting back what they will pay into the system is diminishing. In the year 2015, it will take the average worker 13 years to recover what he pays in payroll taxes. 
This already eroding value of Social Security is compounded by the facts that we are planning to reduce the consumer price index which will lengthen the time it takes to recoup taxes and even more problematic, the trust fund is expected to become insolvent in 2029. 
A lot of work has been left undone by this budget resolution. This resolution does not even begin to make the reforms necessary to ensure that the next generations of Americans can retire with the same dignity as their grandparents and parents. Cutting $115 billion from Medicare is simply a quick fix to get past the initial 2001 exhaustion date. Future seniors should not have to worry about whether Medicare will pay their doctor's bill or whether their Social Security check will arrive on time. 
Mr. President, I was particularly disappointed that this proposal did not invest in education infrastructure. It is a sad fact of life that in thousands upon thousands of classrooms all across the country, our schools are not physically up to the task of educating all Americans for the 21st century. Too many of our schools are literally falling down around our children. 
Too many of our schools are overcrowded to the point where students cannot learn effectively. Too many of our schools do not have the physical infrastructure necessary to support the integration of computers into classrooms. 
According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, which at my request conducted an intensive, 2-year study of the condition of America's schools, 14 million children attend schools in such poor condition they need major renovations or outright replacement; 7 million children attend schools with life-threatening safety code violations; and it will cost $112 billion just to bring schools up to what the GAO calls good, overall condition--in other words--up to code. This budget resolution does nothing to address these concerns. 
Mr. President, education does not just provide benefits to individuals. Education benefits the public. Every single American benefits from improvements to our elementary and secondary education system. 
It is unfortunate, then, that we continue to pay for our education system as though its benefits were individual and local in nature. In order to remain the world's economic leader, we must reform our education funding system that was designed to meet the needs of yesterday's economy. 
Our reliance on local property taxes to pay for elementary and secondary education causes wide disparities in the abilities of school districts to adequately fund education. Under our current system, wealthy communities with low tax rates can often generate sufficient revenues to build the finest facilities, while poor communities with very high tax rates often cannot raise enough to support even mediocre schools. While many poor districts try their hardest, and have the highest tax rates, the system works against them. 
According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, poor and middle-class school districts in 35 States make a greater local tax effort than wealthy districts. In my home State of Illinois, the poorest districts tax themselves at an average rate of 43 percent higher than the wealthiest districts. This phenomenon is our school finance system's greatest irony: the lowest-income areas often have the highest property tax rates and the schools with the fewest resources. 
The GAO found that although most states make some attempt to supplement local funding in poor districts, wealthy school districts in 37 states have more total funding per pupil than poor districts. These disparities exist even after adjusting for differences in geographic and student need-related educational costs. In Illinois, the wealthiest 20 percent of districts have almost two-thirds as much to spend per pupil than the other 80 percent. 
Because we rely on the local property tax to fund education, the opportunities available to our children are subject to the vagaries and disparities of local property wealth. Children in wealthy communities are able to attend the best schools and have the most opportunities, while children in poor and middle-class communities often have access to second-rate facilities and lesser opportunities. This budget resolution does nothing to reverse these trends. 
In conclusion, I believe that our Nation's budget, reduced to its essentials, is very much like the budget of any family. It should balance revenues and spending, it should address the needs and priorities of the various family members, it should be fair in the apportionment of spending and sacrifice, and it should lay a foundation for the future well-being of its members. 
It should address the looming needs of the American family, especially in regards to health care and retirement security, as well as reinvestment in the infrastructure which is in progressively worse shape. 
The agreement reached can be thought of as a decision to pay off some, but not all, of the old bills, to give more support to a variety of family activities, and to give up a part time job. Because the economy is so robust, those decisions represent the cashing in of a prosperity dividend. 
Mr. President, Congress must not only look at the 5 and 10 year effect of the policies we enact. We need to look at how the policies we change today affect the future. It is true that long-term economic estimates are notoriously unreliable, but having said that, long-term budget problems are in no small part related to long-term demographic trends. And long-term demographic trends are reliable. 
Our actions now will impact future generations, our grandchildren. For example, if Social Security were examined under the requirements of private pension funds, you would find that it is underfunded by hundreds of billions of dollars. Congress should look outside the budget horizon, particularly at the long-term budgetary consequences of tax cuts. Tax cuts are back-loaded in this resolution. 
Mr. President, in Alice in Wonderland, Alice asked the Cheshire Cat, `Which way should I go?' And the Cheshire Cat responded `It depends on where you want to go.' Congress must decide which way to go. Mr. President, this budget resolution will balance the budget. But more work needs to be done to meet our obligations to future generations of Americans, to invest in people and to protect their retirement security. Every generation of Americans has addressed and resolved challenges unique to their time. That is what makes our country great. Now is the time to take steps toward ensuring that our generation will honestly address its needs so that future generations will have at least the same opportunity. 
Our generation should leave no less than we inherited.

<TEXT>
Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am going to yield to my colleagues from Massachusetts and Minnesota in a moment to speak on this. But I would just like to pick up the debate where we left off last evening. 
This is the amendment to begin to repair America's crumbling schools and to help provide an environment suitable for learning to the 14 million children who attend school every day in this country, schools with leaky roofs, with crumbling walls, with sewage backing up in the basement, with insufficient electrical equipment to plug in computers, children who attend schools in our country that are not suitable environments for learning. Mr. President, I believe we can do better. 
There has been a great deal of debate about who should pay for the crumbling schools. As we know, it is traditional in this country that State and local governments pay for elementary and secondary education. In fact, the Federal Government only supports elementary and secondary education nationwide at about a 7 percent level, so we are barely engaged in the funding formula. But as it is no doubt apparent, and I know it is apparent to everybody in this room, we are facing a crisis of national proportions because the formula for funding elementary and secondary education just does not work in ways that are adequate to meet the needs of our children. It does not work because the property tax base of elementary and secondary funding has been so inelastic as not to provide for the repair, construction, and maintenance of schools over time. So we are faced with a crisis of monumental national proportions. 
The General Accounting Office tells us it will take $112 billion to repair our schools, to just bring them up to a level of adequacy--code violations removed, where students can actually learn--without even getting to putting in new technologies. It is pretty clear children cannot learn if their schools are falling down around them. They cannot use computers if there are no electrical systems to plug them into. Unless we engage as a national community to provide local districts and to provide States with some assistance in meeting this huge challenge, the challenge will continue to go unmet and we will hamstring an entire generation and make them less capable of competing in this global economy, this technological age. 
We can do better. Our parents turned over to us schools that were adequate to our needs. The public schools were not in this condition. In fact, if anything, most of the schools that most American children attend were built for our generation. We have an obligation to help provide some financial assistance to States and to local districts to repair their crumbling schools. 
I wanted to put it on a light note before I turned it over to my colleagues. I thought this was a perfect picture to talk about where we are. This is a cartoon. As a matter of fact, I have two cartoons. The first one says, `A computer in class opens a whole new world for us.' And the little girl says, `Look, a picture of a school with no leaking roof, no peeling paint, with textbooks for everyone. . . .' 
`A whole new world for us' because this is the real world. It is the crumbling schools, the broken plaster in the walls, the lack of electrical connections, broken plumbing, code violations, lead paint in the walls, asbestos--that is the environment to which we send our children to schools. The new one would be one with no leaking roof, no peeling paint, and with textbooks for everyone. This one, unfortunately, is the reality. 
The second cartoon speaks to the reality again as well. Again, these are issues that everybody knows to be true. That is why it is almost surprising to even have to say these things. All you have to do is go out in your State, and you will see schools in this kind of condition. This is Peppermint Patty. Peppermint Patty's crumbling school. Peppermint Patty, in the first few panels, talks about how the roof is leaking again. And then Marcie says, `Sir, the roof is leaking again and you are getting all wet.' 
`I don't like to complain, Marcie.' 
`Then I'll do it for you. We were just wondering, ma'am, if perchance you might have noticed . . . the roof is leaking.' 
And then the custodian, of course, goes up, falls off the roof, and then, `How about that, Marcie, I think they fixed the leak in the roof. Let's just hope there aren't some other places where . . .' and that's when the rain starts coming down on Marcie herself. 
As we talk about the importance of education, of a college education, of national standards and goals and the like for education--it is conversation. It is just conversation if we don't give the youngsters an environment in which to learn. They clearly cannot learn if the environment, the setting, is such that it impedes their ability to access the technology, it diminishes their ability to focus in on what it is we are trying to communicate to them. 
This last panel which I wanted to bring to your attention, really, I thought, points out the problem altogether. That is, infrastructure, facilities, the environment, the structure have been forgotten. It is everybody pointing fingers at everybody else. It's this unit of government's job, it's that unit of government's job, it is not our responsibility; turning our backs, pointing fingers, and forgetting altogether about the basics. We are talking about computers, but we haven't remembered that you have to have electrical systems to use them. So this last one says, `This is how it is, Mr. Principal. Half the kids in our class can't read and half can't multiply 6 by 8. None of them ever heard of Bosnia and couldn't tell you who wrote Hamlet.' 
`I talked to the principal, sir.' 
`What did he say about the leaking roof?' says Peppermint Patty, who is under a rainstorm. 
And Marcie says, `I forgot to mention it.' 
Well, we have been forgetting to mention it. We have been neglecting infrastructure and we have been letting the problem get worse and worse. As with any maintenance issue, if you let it go, it doesn't get better, it just gets worse. So this amendment, this $5 billion, is just a start to try to reach the level of the $112 billion that the General Accounting Office tells us is needed. 
Here is reality. I have been showing cartoons, but this is reality. This is a chemistry lab, built probably when I was in high school, if not before--probably when my parents were in high school. Clearly, this is not suitable to teach any youngster chemistry in these times. There is no equipment. It is falling down. You can see this is just age; this is not kids trashing the school. That's just old, outdated--I would imagine, from the type of construction, since I like to do construction, this is probably close to the 1920's, if not earlier. 
Here is another. Desks that you and I probably used that have been recycled, Mr. President, with peeling paint. One of the problems the GAO found is a lot of the paint peeling has lead in it, and we know from other research what lead does to youngsters. 
Here's another one. The kids may have trashed the lockers, but at the same time the lockers seem to me to have gone a long way toward being trashed before the kids got there. You can't use these things. 
But this is the condition of the schools. 
Here is another lab. Look at that. What do we tell our children about the value of education? What do we tell them about what we think about them, sending them into conditions like this? 
Before I conclude, I want to point out something that may be counterintuitive about this whole issue but that is reality; that is, crumbling schools is not just an inner city problem. Crumbling schools are not just problems in poor communities. Crumbling schools happen all over our country. In fact, the GAO tells us the central cities experience crumbling schools at a rate of 38 percent; the suburban communities at a rate of 29 percent; the rural communities at a rate of 30 percent. Add to that that it is a nationwide problem--in fact, if anything, the West has this 
problem more than the Midwest, and the East has it more than the Midwest. So it is a problem that is national and is in every kind of community and affects 14 million children every day. 
It is shameful to me that we did not have this already in the budget as part of the budget agreement. I was very distressed about that part. But I hope the Members of this Chamber will recognize that this is reality, that we have to have a partnership. We need to help States and local governments meet this need. We are not looking to take anything over. This will maintain local control of the schools, local control of the decisionmaking about what schools get fixed and what features get addressed. But, surely, surely, with a $112 billion national problem, here at the national level we can find $5 billion to help our school districts and our States repair the crumbling schools in which we expect our children to learn. 
Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his eloquence and for his support. 
I want to yield some time to the Senator from Minnesota, but first I want to point out a couple of things. 
The Senator from Massachusetts talked about the classroom. It is a fact that in America, the rungs of the ladder of opportunity are still crafted in the classroom, and we now know that classrooms all across this country are falling apart and crumbling. The General Accounting Office told us in this report, `Condition of America's Schools,' that it is going to take $112 billion nationally to even bring our schools up to code. So this is no mistake, Mr. President. This is something that is documented by an exhaustive study by the General Accounting Office. 
They also then went on to tell us that in addition, `America's Schools Are Not Designed or Equipped for the 21st Century.' So they went on to tell us what these charts say and pictures say and all of us know: That you cannot use computers in a classroom with a broken window, with falling ceilings, with peeling paint with lead in it, with no electrical system. This has been confirmed by the General Accounting Office. 
Then they went on to tell us, with `Profiles of School Conditions by State,' that this is a national problem. This is not just Illinois or Massachusetts or Minnesota, this is all over America, and each State has this problem. 
Then they went on to tell us, `States' Financial and Technical Support Varies,' that `America's Schools Report Differing Conditions,' and that `State Efforts to Reduce Funding Gaps Between Poor and Wealthy Districts' are poor and inadequate. 
I submit to you, Mr. President, that if all the States and cities, the local school districts, the rural communities all did their best in terms of property tax support for rebuilding our crumbling schools, they would have a hard time coming up with $112 
billion without some assistance.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his question, and he is exactly on the point. I absolutely agree. In fact, this is the cookbook; this is the book with the loopholes. It is called a loophole book instead of a cookbook. Here are the loopholes. The people who are billionaires can leave the country, renounce their U.S. citizenship and not pay a dime of taxes. In fact, they do it so they will not have to pay taxes on their money, and that represents more than we are asking for to rebuild our crumbling schools, and yet that is not taken out.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for the question. And I think the message that it sends is that we are a bunch of hypocrites. I think the message that it sends is that everybody talks about education. We have an `education everything.' You can find probably an education dogcatcher somewhere in America that ran on a platform: I'm going to fix the schools. But we never seem to be able to get there. 
And so after a while the children become cynical and begin to believe that we do not believe education is important, that we do not really put our money where our mouth is, that we are prepared to send them into classrooms that suggest a diminished support or diminished importance of what they do. 
We send our children to classrooms every day in conditions that we would allow no worker to work in. We send our children to classrooms every day that we would not for a moment tolerate in our homes. And so if that is the case, then we say, well, we want you to go to learn somewhere that looks like this, that looks like the charts I have had. And we expect you to learn in that environment. What that says is learning is not really important. 
As we stand up and make our pious speeches about the globalization of our economy and the information age and the brave new world--again, that is why I thought this cartoon was so funny. `A computer in class opens a whole new world for us!' `Look! A picture of a school with no leaking roof, no peeling paint, with textbooks for everyone * * *.' That is a whole new world, because the world we give them is one with peeling paint and leaking roofs and no textbooks. I think it is just outrageous and shameful.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. That is right. Out of $2.3 trillion, $5 billion pales in comparison. It is just a start. It is not a budget buster by any means. In fact, if anything, it keeps the bottom line constant and just says we are going to give out a little less in tax breaks, we are just going to do a little less on the tax side, we are going to be a little more moderate in how many chickens we try to put in every pot and instead focus on our priorities and provide our youngsters with an opportunity to learn. That is all it does, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. 
I want to pick up with one other point the Senator made. And that is, there is no reason why this should be a partisan issue. Politics should stop at the schoolroom door. There ought to be Republican legislators and Democratic legislators alike standing up saying, we are prepared to help our States and local governments fix our crumbling schools. 
This should not come down to being: The Republicans are for crumbling schools and the Democrats want to fix them. This should not come down to being: Republicans do not care about their States having to meet 112 billion dollars' worth of need that the General Accounting Office has documented State by State. 
And I suggest to my colleagues, I know your staffs all have them, but we have sent around copies of a State-by-State analysis. Take a look at what your State has in terms of the cost of bringing the schools just up to code. 
We are not talking about bells and whistles here. We are not talking about putting computers in the classrooms here. We are not talking about curtains. We are not even talking about new paint jobs. We are talking about taking care of the foundation, the electrical wiring, the plumbing, the roof, the windows, the basics, 
the floors. 
There was a school in the southern part of our country where the roof caved in altogether, a few minutes after the children had left the classroom; a school in my State where the track team had to use the prison because the gymnasium was so rotted away. It is an outrage and a shame, and we have an opportunity to address this problem on a bipartisan basis this morning. 
The Senator from Minnesota has been kind enough to wait here. 
I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. The Senator from Florida raises a very good point that I did not touch on but I think it is important to mention and that is that we at the national level do not even pay for the Federal mandates. We are not even paying or giving the States and local governments the assistance they need to pay for the things we have told them to do. 
Small wonder that the resources get diverted, and so we wind up with crumbling roofs and classrooms that look like this. Small wonder. We put this burden on them, and now we are saying in terms of what you need to do, we are not going to help. 
Well, I hope that is not the message this morning. I hope that Republicans and Democrats alike will come together on behalf of giving our children a decent environment in which they need to learn. 
Less than 1 percent of this budget, less than 1 percent goes to support elementary and secondary education. Less than 1 percent. So we stand up and we have education this, that, and the other--the education Senator, the education President, the education Governors, the education mayors, and less than 1 percent of this budget goes to education. None goes to fix our crumbling schools unless we pass this amendment.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to respond at the outset to my friend, the Senator from New Mexico, who says this is the first time we have ever been involved in trying to repair our Nation's schools, that it is a new initiative, that we have never done this before. In fact, between 1933 and 1939, the Federal Government aided 70 percent of all new school construction. Mr. President, a lot of our children are attending those very same schools. 
In fact, in America today, 74 percent of the schools are over 25 years old and a third of the schools are over 50 years old. So there is no question that if you do not repair a 50-year-old building, it is going to begin to look like this. This is one of the reasons why we have the troubled-school phenomenon. 
The second issue that has been raised has to do with the contributions of State and local governments. Again, I would point out this is not looking to take over anything. We just want to have a partnership to help State and local governments meet the $112 billion amount it is going to take to repair their crumbling schools. 
The President did, in fact, support this in his State of the Union Address. He said our children cannot raise themselves up in schools that are literally falling down around them. Similarly, the Department of Education has a long letter talking about the leveraging and the financing assistance that we will give the States should this amendment be approved. 
But let me say to my colleague, in the final analysis, really, this modest contribution is not about setting a precedent. It is about whether or not we will allow for elementary and secondary education to get up to 1 percent of our total budget we are voting on here to help begin to tackle 112 billion dollars' worth of rot in our schools. We are asking that it come out of the tax breaks that we are giving in this budget, in some instances to the very wealthy. 
I thought it was kind of ironic; in yesterday's New York Times there was a headline talking about `Tax Breaks Costly for Schools in Cleveland.' I want to point out that tax breaks are going to be costly for schools all over America because we are giving tax breaks at a time when we are saying we do not have the wherewithal to provide a modest amount to help States and help local communities meet the challenge of repairing their crumbling schools. 
I hope that on both sides of this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats alike will send a message that we are willing to help, we are willing to help States and local communities provide an environment that is suitable for learning by our children. They are, after all, the children of all. They are America's children. Just as the generation before us stepped up to build new schools and provide environments for learning for our time, I believe our generation has an obligation to step up to the plate to assist in meeting this $112 billion challenge and help rebuild the crumbling schools which we ask our children to attend. 
I have already made the point it is a national issue. It is in every kind of community--urban, suburban and rural. It is all over America. Mr. President, $5 billion is just a contribution, a contribution to the States and local governments so they can borrow the money they need to meet what is a national challenge. 
Senator Durbin actually hit the nail on the head when he made the analogy to our roads. If we just built roads based on what a local community could do, you could not get from one end of this great Nation to the other. But we cooperate and collaborate with each other to build a highway system so that we can have transportation that serves our national interests. 
Mr. President, crumbling schools are not in our national interest. Crumbling schools hurt our country. Crumbling schools hurt our children. If we are going to give our country the ability to be competitive in this global economy, if we are going to give our children the capacity to command information technologies that are so much a part of their time, we cannot expect them to learn in environments like this. 
We can make this modest contribution, recognizing that it is an appropriate Federal role to provide this kind of support and help. I hope that when this vote happens, we do have bipartisan support; that this does not become a matter of Republicans saying they are not willing to provide this assistance to State and local governments to help provide children, our children, with an environment suitable for their education. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will see that this is something we can 
do within the context of this budget; that we can do this without causing harm to anyone. We ought to be able to close a few tax loopholes so we can provide modest support for our children and for State and local government efforts to repair our crumbling schools.

<TEXT>
Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, this amendment provides $5 billion to create a partnership among all levels of government to help States and school districts meet their school repair, renovation, modernization and construction priorities. 
The point of this amendment is to focus Federal resources, and to focus our support as a national community for rebuilding the schools in our country. Every day, 14 million American children attend schools that are in such dilapidated condition, and present such an unsuitable environment for learning, that their ability to access educational opportunity is impaired and impeded and diminished. 
So this amendment seeks to address the budget resolution that has been agreed upon by allocating $5 billion to the Labor Committee to help school districts meet their most urgent school repair, renovation, and modernization and construction needs. It would allow us to create a partnership among the national, State, and local governments to repair our crumbling schools and help prepare our children for the 21st Century. 
This amendment is not specific to any school construction plan. It is an up-or-down vote on whether or not the Senate believes school construction ought to be a priority. 
I want to take a moment to talk about school construction and why it is important for us to be engaged as a national community in support of the environment in which we expect our children to learn. At no point in our history has education been more important to individual achievement and to our national well-being. 
According to a just-published Hudson Institute study of the changing American work force, `The crucial factor accounting for long-term success in the work force is a basic education provided at the primary and secondary levels.' 
The Wall Street Journal recently quoted a leading U.S. economist who said, `One of the few things that economists will agree upon is the fact that economic growth is very strongly dependent on our own abilities.' 
Mr. President, that is true. 
We are putting our Nation's economic future at risk by shortchanging our kids at schools that are literally falling down around them. Unfortunately--and it is an unfortunate fact--many of our schools are not in adequate physical condition to meet the educational needs of our children. Many of our children attend schools that are literally falling down around them.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Madam President, that is correct, and we will take this up, again, in the morning as part of the vote. 
I just want to say in closing, it is a funny thing, reality really does have a ring about it that is unavoidable, and I don't think there is anyone in this Chamber or anyone who is a Member of this Senate who, if they spent the time to go around in their own States and visit the schools there, elementary and secondary schools, will deny the validity of what the GAO has told us is true. 
Everyone knows about the crumbling school problem, and if you talk to your constituents or visit schools in your area, you will find it there. That is what is so stunning about this issue. It is not an inner-city issue, it is not a Midwestern issue, it is an American issue, and it affects every kind of community and every kind of child. If, indeed, we are going to turn our back and say we have other things to do, we are too busy to get around fixing the window but we want you to meet these standards, we are not going to help these States meet this $112 billion burden, but we are going to give them all the flexibility in the world, or we are not going to give the local governments--the local communities that are taxing themselves the most and are having the hardest time repairing these crumbling schools. 
That is what is so compelling to me in engaging this new partnership in which we don't take over Federal educational content. No one is looking to do that. It is appropriate that local governments deal with what kind of schools they have and what the children learn, the conditions and the teachers and the curriculum and those kinds of things. I think that is appropriate. So we are not talking about the Federal Government taking over anything, but rather, in this air of flexibility, saying we are prepared to be responsible and give the flexibility and help States and local governments meet this $112 billion challenge, because, indeed, our very national security is at risk. We will not be able to stay the greatest country in the world in this global economy in the world if we send our children to schools where even Peppermint Patty gets rained on in the classroom. 
I thank very much the Senator from New Jersey. I thank my colleagues.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Thank you, Madam President. In the first place, what we are talking about fixing are our Nation's schools. 
I think we can have a separate debate, a separate vote on the merits of paying workers prevailing wages. But I would point out to my colleague that some 32 States, many cities and townships, already have their own prevailing wage laws affecting school construction. And frankly, any school district that is receiving Federal Impact Aid funding today is already subject to Davis-Bacon. 
Now, the truth is that Davis-Bacon applies to Federal highway construction, and few people argue that the Federal Government has no role in highway construction. 
I ask my colleague, what is the difference? If the highways were in this kind of condition, clearly there would be a rush to create a partnership so that we can provide support in order to support transportation in our Nation. But the schools are in this condition. And the Senator is suggesting that we turn our backs and say it is up to the States and local governments to do it by themselves. 
I think the pictures and the debate about this issue demonstrate very clearly that they have not been able to do it by themselves, and it has not been through want of trying. It is not as though school districts have deliberately set out to put children in classrooms that look like this. It is not as though local school boards have not wanted to vote the money to provide for the schools. 
The Senator from Vermont knows full well that with the District of Columbia schools you see the condition. And it is not as though the people here in D.C. did not want to make certain the windows were fixed, but they had other emergencies. That is the exigencies of education they had to meet first: classrooms, textbooks, lighting, the basics, teacher salaries. So the funds have gone to that. And maintenance has been deferred time and time again. 
Again, of the 50 percent of the schools in this country that are over 50 years old, in all too many instances those schools have suffered just about that same amount of neglect and deferred maintenance. Well, as with maintenance of anything else, it just gets worse as the problem gets older. 
This problem is going to get worse and worse over time. And school districts have been trying. In fact, one of the reports by the General Accounting Office talked about the fact that school districts that have the least try the hardest and that they have been trying to meet these infrastructure needs, but all too often have not been able to. They cannot go into the capital markets to borrow money at favorable rates because they do not have the bond rating. So the result is classrooms that look like this. 
So I will just suggest to my colleagues that this is not in any way about Washington telling school districts what classrooms to fix or what schools to rebuild or where to put the construction effort. In fact, the whole idea is to have that kind of decisionmaking start at the local level and start and stay at the local and State level. That is the point of their decisionmaking. All we would do as a national community is to give financial assistance in ways that will allow these local districts to leverage additional money to meet what is clearly their local need on the one hand but, in the final analysis, is our entire need. 
If one community or another cannot afford to provide their youngsters with laboratories in which their youngsters can learn chemistry, how can we expect to be competitive in a global economy, in global competition? If a community cannot afford it and is being taxed to the maximum extent, and they just do not have the money to address the basics of the rain coming through the window or the roof leaking, how can we expect these youngsters to learn, even assuming for a moment there are other program priorities that the Federal Government has traditionally taken up with regard to elementary and secondary education? 
Of course, our role has always, as a national community, been limited in elementary and secondary education. But even assuming for a moment that there are other priorities, I daresay, it should go without argument that ought to be a priority also. Our kids cannot learn, they cannot take advantage of whatever those other priorities are in schools that are literally falling down around them. 
We are going to take a vote on this tomorrow morning. There will be some further debate about it tomorrow morning. I encourage my colleagues to take a close look, to call home, to check out what is going on in your own States, because this is a problem that, again, is national in scope, but it particularly goes to the well-being and the access to educational opportunity for every child in this country. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I thank Senator Kennedy very much. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I would like to join many of my colleagues in opposing S. 4. 
People across the country are working hard to realize the American Dream of economic security for their families. At the same time, it is increasingly apparent that parents are having to struggle to balance the competing interests of work and family. Parents are being forced to choose between paying for health care and education for their children, for instance, and spending quality time with them so they can be happy and succeed. The Federal Government's policies need to support efforts to strengthen families as well as efforts to realize the American Dream. 
I do not believe, however, that S. 4, the so-called `Family Friendly Workplace Act,' is an appropriate response to the problems facing working families. While the title of the bill sounds benign enough, the consequences will be detrimental to all working people and to working parents in particular. Parents could end up with less control over their work schedule and less money to pay for raising their families. The paycheck reduction act might be a more appropriate name. 
This legislation purports to allow working people the flexibility to choose between overtime pay and compensatory time off or flexible credit hours and replaces the 40-hour work week with an 80-hour 2 week work period, with hours to be agreed upon by the employers and the employees. Each of these provisions will have serious adverse consequences for working families. 
The most serious concern is that employees would not, in fact, be given a choice. Employers would favor an employee who consistently chose comptime over overtime when assigning overtime hours. The atmosphere in the workplace might lead employees to believe that their jobs depended on their choosing comptime instead of overtime, or to work 60 hours in a busy week and 20 hours in a slow week regardless of the needs of the family. 
Overtime pay is a significant source of income for many American families. Thousands of families pay for food, shelter, education and retirement by earning overtime at time-and-a-half. With the growing income gap between the rich and poor, and with the middle class working harder than ever working Americans have little room to give on wages. If S. 4 results in the end of overtime, it will mark the end of many people's ability to provide for their children and to remain part of the American middle class. 
The 40-hour work week is a basic protection for workers. We talk about wanting to strengthen the family unit, eliminate single parent families, and provide important parental supports so that parents can care for their children. 
If an employee has to work 65 hours one week and 15 hours the next, their schedule is going to dictate chaos for the whole family. Imagine if your mom was home early one week and then not home for dinner at all the next. Obtaining decent child care, already difficult for many parents, could become even harder due to the erratic work schedule and odd hours of a mother or father working 80 hours in two weeks. Without real employee choice, the 80-hour work week could spell disaster for a family. 
While there are some provisions in the legislation to prevent employers from forcing employees to choose compensatory time instead of overtime or to work excessive hours one week, these provisions are weak and insufficient to protect employees. I and my staff have met with many employers from Illinois who are good employers, just trying to make their businesses work better and their employee's lives better. I point out, however, that while Illinois may have many ideal employers, there are currently overtime abuses across the country. Abuses that the Labor Department is unable to enforce due to the sheer number of them and the lack of resources in the Department.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
There really is no more important value than life. The only question that is raised today with this debate is, whose life? 
This debate is about women's health, women's rights, women's choices, and their stories, but, most importantly, this debate is about women's lives. This is not a place for the kind of screaming, fiery rhetoric we have heard here. If anything, we need to listen to each other, we need to hear the voices of people, of women who have been faced with the choices and the issues, who have been faced with troubled pregnancies and understand that somewhere in this very controversial area, there is guidance for us and there are answers for us. 
This debate is about whether or not women are going to have the ability to make decisions regarding their own reproductive health, whether women will have and be able to exercise their constitutional rights to privacy, whether women will be able to make decisions regarding their own pregnancies, and this debate, in the final analysis, is about whether women are going to be heard. 
Women's health is at stake with this legislation. We cannot afford to have women suffer irrevocable and irreparable harm due to pregnancy where we have the medical ability to prevent that harm and save the woman's life. We should not dictate that an unborn fetus is more precious to us than the life or the health of its mother. 
In 1900, some 600 women died in childbirth in the United States for every 100,000 live births. Death in childbirth was a regular tragic occurrence. But by 1970, 21.5 women died in childbirth for every 100,000 live births. Today, that number has dropped to less than 10. Women are surviving in childbirth because of advances in medicine. 
These figures show us that the maternal death rate has dropped by some two-thirds since the Supreme Court affirmed the right of a woman to obtain a safe and legal abortion. This is an important reduction in maternal mortality and one which I know we are all thankful for. But it seems to matter less to some in this debate that some women may well die if the right to make choices about their own health is taken away from them. Abortion should be safe, it should be legal, and it should be rare. 
Mr. President, it seems to me that legislation that we are debating right now to ban certain specific abortion procedures would turn back the advances that have been made in medical science and have been made with regard to maternal health and maternal death rates, and it would dictate to doctors what procedures they can and cannot use to protect the life and health of their patients. 
One of the Senators who spoke on the floor today talked about protecting politicians versus protecting babies. Well, the point is that the politicians should have nothing to do with this. This is a question for the mother, the child, the family, and their God. 
Mr. President, in this legislation there is no exception, none, to protect the health of the mother. And so this legislation, H.R. 1122, the underlying bill, lays aside altogether the advances in medical science. The training of doctors is disregarded altogether. Women's health is ignored. And so essentially it would send us back to the status of the law that existed before Roe versus Wade was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court and when we had such a prevalence of maternal deaths. 
Some have argued that the procedure being banned in this legislation is being banned because it is medically dangerous. Well, Mr. President, if it is dangerous then doctors should make that determination, not Senators. That is their job; it is not ours. 
Some have argued the procedure is unnecessary. And yet the legislation contains a narrow life exception to the ban. If that exception is needed, that is because in some circumstances the procedure that is involved here is needed. Physicians have said this and have written to us about this. And so you really have to take a chance that you might not force a woman to die because of the decisionmaking that will be made in this Chamber. But again, this is essentially a medical decision, what procedure to use in the case of a troubled pregnancy. 
Mr. President, women's rights also are at stake. And this is a very important point. Women's rights as equal citizens under the law are at stake in this debate. Women fought for generations for full protections under the law in our Constitution. And this legislation rolls back the clock. I would point out, women were not even citizens in this country until 75 years ago. We just then got the right to vote in this country. 
This legislation unfortunately, in my opinion, assumes that female citizens do not have rights which the unborn are bound to have. The debate that we are now engaged in has turned the notion of entitlement of citizenship right on its head by giving the unborn equal or even greater status than their mother, as I believe this legislation does. Legal conclusions may be reached that reduce women to second-class citizenship. 
And so the legislation reduces the status of all women as citizens, but even more tragically, it could very well result in a death sentence for some women by forcing a choice between the life of the mother and the life of the fetus, particularly in cases of poor women or rural women who do not have easy access to the top-quality health care, the health care that could save the life of someone if they were fortunate enough to be able to access it. 
So we are essentially debating whether or not we are going to sentence some women who have difficult pregnancies to a death sentence with this legislation. 
The Supreme Court had ruled in Roe, States cannot restrict a woman's access to abortion in the first or second trimesters. The Court has said that the interests of the potential citizen, that is not yet a citizen, that is not yet viable, cannot be placed in front of the rights of a woman who is currently a full citizen. 
In addition, the Court has ruled that while the States may have a compelling interest to legislate restrictions on postviability abortions, there must be an exemption for the life and health of the mother. That basic exemption for life and health is missing from the underlying legislation that we are debating today. And so I submit that the legislation fails to protect 
fundamental rights of female citizens. 
Mr. President, women's choices are at stake in this legislation. Choosing to terminate a pregnancy is the most personal and private and fundamental decision that a woman can make about her own health--about her own health and her own life. 
Choice is, when boiled down to its essentials, a matter of freedom. It is a fundamental issue of the relationship of a female citizen, a woman citizen to her Government. Choice is a barometer of equality and a measure of fairness. And it is, I believe, central to our liberty. 
I do not personally favor abortion as a method of birth control. My own religious beliefs hold life dear. And I would prefer that every potential child have a chance to be born. But whether or not that child will be born must be a mother's personal decision, a woman's personal decision. 
I fully support the choice of those women who carry their pregnancies to term no matter what the circumstances. But I also respect the choice of those women who, under difficult circumstances where their life and health may be endangered, choose not to go forward with that pregnancy. 
I also believe, Mr. President, this is a choice that can only be made by a woman in consultation with her doctor, her family, and her God. Politicians should have no role to play in making so basic a decision. 
I recognize that the American people are deeply divided on this issue. People of goodwill will hold greatly differing opinions on the issues we are debating today. And I respect those differences as well. 
I have joined my colleagues, Senators Feinstein and Boxer in introducing a substitute amendment banning postviability abortions except in the cases where the life or the health of the mother is threatened. I ask the Senator from California to yield me as much time as I need. I need a few more minutes.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I want to talk about the substitute amendment, the Feinstein-Boxer-Moseley-Braun substitute, because it is really very straightforward. 
It shall be unlawful, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, for a physician knowingly to perform an abortion after the fetus has become viable. 
Why is this opposed? 
It is opposed because the second section says that: 
* * * if, in the medical judgment of the attending physician, the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the woman or to avert serious adverse health consequences to the woman [this absolute ban does not apply]. 
So what this says is that women's lives, women's health, women's choices are respected by the substitute amendment, but not by the underlying legislation. I believe that this substitute amendment is clearly constitutional, that it is far-reaching, that it does not direct a doctor to choose one medical procedure over another, that it protects future citizens but it also insures, Mr. President, that under no circumstances will women be prevented from accessing the best medical care possible to save their lives or to prevent serious adverse health consequences, such as the loss of their fertility. 
When I started, I mentioned that women's stories are being ignored in this debate with this legislation. And I cannot recount the story of Vikki Stella, Vikki Stella from Naperville, IL, without being reminded just how important this fight is for families everywhere. 
Our provision, the provision introduced by Senator Feinstein, would protect women like Vikki Stella from Naperville, IL. There 
can be no greater argument against the underlying bill, H.R. 1122, than this story, in my opinion. 
Vikki Stella and her husband were expecting their third child, Anthony. At 20 weeks, she went for a sonogram and was told that she and her child were healthy. 
At 32 weeks, that is to say in the last trimester of her pregnancy, 8 months pregnant, Vikki took her two daughters with her to watch their brother on the sonogram. 
But the technician that was administering the sonogram was quiet and did not really respond, and asked Vikki if she would come upstairs to talk to the doctor. Vikki thought perhaps that the baby might be breach. As a diabetic she knew that any complications in her pregnancy could be very serious. 
Well, the doctor was too busy to see her that day but called at 7 o'clock the next morning, called to say that the leg bones, the femurs on the fetus, seemed a little short, but would she come back in. He assured her there was a 99-percent chance that nothing was wrong, but she should still come in for a level 2 ultrasound. 
Well, Mr. President, after that second ultrasound Vikki and her husband and her family were told that the child she was carrying had no brain. It was an abnormality incompatible with life. And Vikki then had to make the hardest decision that she says she had ever made. I want to use her words. She said, `I had to remove my son from life support--that was me.' 
Now, Vikki's decision would be illegal under the underlying bill, H.R. 1122, that we are debating right now. Vikki's doctor could have gone to jail under the Senator's legislation. And Vikki's family would have suffered a tragedy, perhaps in the loss of her life or the loss of her ability to have other children. All of those implications would have been a tragedy for this family from my State of Illinois. 
As it turns out, the story had a better ending because the procedure was performed. Vikki's fertility was maintained. She did not die, and she is now the proud parent of, in her own words, `a beautiful baby boy named Nicholas Archer.' 
Nicholas Archer was able to be born because H.R. 1122 was not law, Mr. President, because Vikki was able to obtain the procedure that would be banned by this bill. She was able to consider the possible options with her doctor, her family, and her God in private without the interference of politicians. She was able to make a choice that was best for her and best for her family. And she was able to give birth to Nicholas Archer. 
Vikki's story, Mr. President, is why we must not support the underlying bill here. 
I am going to make another point that I have made before, and it is a difficult one. And I mean no disrespect by it, but I think it is particularly important for Senators to listen to, not just hear but to listen to Vikki's story, because, frankly, over 90 percent of the Members of this U.S. Senate are about to legislate on something that they could never experience. 
Now, that is not to say that men do not have an interest in this. They do. But they cannot know--and again I mean no disrespect--cannot know how it feels to be pregnant, cannot know how it feels to carry a troubled pregnancy, cannot know how central to one's life reproductive health is. So what we are talking about is legislation based on second-hand intelligence and hypothetical experience. 
One of the reasons this debate sounds so awkward with descriptions of the female reproductive organs and `carrying to term' is that it is being talked about by people who cannot, as a matter of personal experience, know what is involved, have never themselves had a pregnancy, have never themselves had to go to an obstetrician and be examined and told your health is going to be affected one way or the other. 
And can you imagine how Vikki Stella felt at 8 months? I know what being 8 months pregnant is like. How many other Members of the Senate know how it feels to be 8 months in that condition, and then to find out that the baby that you are carrying has no brain? And then to be told you cannot choose what kind of decisions to make about your health. Your doctor has nothing to say about the procedures to save your life because of legislation that the U.S. Senate took up. 
Mr. President, there is an editorial in the St. Louis Post Dispatch. And I just want to read the middle part here:  
Certainly, most people are repelled by the idea of a third-trimester abortion and rightly so. But they should also realize that most women who have late-term abortions never wanted to end their pregnancies; they expected to have their babies but something drastic or unpredictable happened.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Well, we are about to say--predictable, unpredictable, drastic circumstances, viability notwithstanding--no woman has that choice about her own body, about her own life, about her own baby, about her own family. That is what the underlying legislation would do. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the underlying legislation. We must protect the health, the rights, the reproductive choice of women. If we would just listen to the tragic stories of the women who have fought to recover from the loss of a child, to keep their families together, and to tell us their stories, we can make a better decision here. And I hope that the rhetoric will tone down. 
I hope that the rhetoric will tone down and we will focus on the fact that this is not a hypothetical. This is not just legislating in a vacuum. We are really talking about something as central as one's personal ability to make decisions about one's own body, about one's own health. That is an issue for women that transcends the second-hand intelligence of those standing on the side who would make choices about us, make choices that would reduce our citizenship to something that could be legislated from afar. 
I urge my colleagues to support the alternative that Senator Feinstein has filed. This alternative will ban all postviability abortions, but it will make an exception for the life and for the health of the mother, and preserve women's rights to choose with regard to their own reproductive health. 
I thank my colleagues. I yield back to the Senator from California.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I respond by saying to my colleague from Pennsylvania that, again, you did not really ask a question. You were making a statement, but it is very difficult to make a statement like that. 
I used a picture of Vikki Stella. That is a real person, a real woman, who had a troubled pregnancy that had to be ended in a late-term abortion. 
You are using a cartoon, a cartoon that is a child. The question you asked had to do with the cartoon you had. Now, if your point is that this child, there was a decision about this child's health or her mother's health at the time of the delivery, that is another story, but that is not the question you asked. That is not the question you put. 
The only point I say is, if you are going to talk about these issues, then it really should be based on reality and not just posturing and not just politics. I am afraid this debate, frankly, has degenerated to that.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, our amendment sets aside $400,000 for costs associated with the replacement of Gaumer Bridge in Vermilion County, IL. 
The town of Alvin, IL is bisected by a heavily-traveled railroad line. There used to be three ways of getting from the East side of Alvin, where the fire station and other emergency facilities are located, to the West side. Cars could drive over either of two railroad crossings, or over Gaumer Bridge. Unfortunately, Gaumer Bridge was damaged by a flood in 1994 and removed by local officials in 1995. The bridge has not been replaced. 
Today, the only way to get from one side of Alvin to the other is by crossing over one of the two railroad crossings, which are not far apart. If a train stalls or breaks down, it could easily block both intersections at once, cutting off 165 Alvin residents from the rest of the town and from emergency services. 
According to Alvin residents, trains have blocked both intersections twice since the bridge was removed. One time, a train shut down for more than 4 hours in the middle of the night. According to news accounts, one resident had to climb under the train to get home, and another resident was almost fired from his job because he could not get out to get to work. Residents and local officials are concerned it is only a matter of time before a real tragedy occurs, when emergency vehicles will be unable to get to residents on the West side of Alvin. 
This amendment will provide the funds necessary to replace Gaumer Bridge, so that Alvin residents who live west of the train tracks will no longer face the possibility of isolation. 
I want to thank the managers of this bill for agreeing to include this provision in the bill.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the first-annual Family Peace Day in Chicago, IL. 
The goal of Family Peace Day is to focus attention on domestic abuse issues, how to combat domestic violence and build healthy families, to address legal issues and to inform Illinois citizens of the resources available to combat domestic violence. 
Family Peace Day is a joint project of the Women's Bar Association of Illinois and the Black Women Lawyers' Association of Greater Chicago, Inc. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, Justice Mary Ann G. McMorrow of the Illinois Supreme Court, Chief Judge Donald O'Connell of the Circuit Court of Cook County, and Cook County Board President John H. Stroger, Jr., are serving as honorary cochairs. Additional supporters include Attorney General James Ryan, Chicago Metropolitan Battered Women's Domestic Violence Network, Chicago Public Schools, Chief Judge Donald O'Connell's Domestic Violence Coordinating Council, Cook County State's Attorney Richard Devine, the Department of Children and Family Services, Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council, and many legal, judicial, health care, social service and nonprofit organizations, including the American Medical Association, the Archdiocese of Chicago, the Chicago Police Department, the Council for the Jewish Elderly, the John Marshall Law School, the Mujeres Latinas En Accion, and the Peace Museum. I commend these individuals and organizations for working together to help victims of domestic abuse and to teach individuals how to combat domestic violence and build healthy families. 
The Family Peace Day activities will begin with a press conference kickoff rally and award presentation to Chicago public school student winners of poetry, prose, and poster contests depicting their vision of a healthy family. There will be an Expo consisting of booths providing the public free legal and medical advice and counseling or referrals from social service providers, health care providers, and attorneys practicing family law. At noon there will be a luncheon awards ceremony at the Palmer House Hilton, sponsored by the Circuit Court of Cook County, to honor those who have made significant contributions to the administration of justice in the areas of domestic violence and abuse. 
There can be no more important goal than healthy, safe, and strong families. I am proud that Chicago is taking the lead in holding the first Family Peace Day and I look forward to communities around the country joining in with their own Family Peace Day activities.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today that will amend legislation written by my former colleague, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Paul Simon, and enacted into law. Three years ago, Senator Simon was the leader in enacting the Immigration and Nationality and Technical Corrections Act of 1994. My bill seeks to add a further correction to the Immigration and Nationality Act, so that the spirit and intent of Senator Simon's work is enacted into law. 
Prior to 1934, a child born overseas to a U.S. father and a foreign mother was recognized by the United States as a U.S. citizen. However, a child born overseas to a U.S. mother and a foreign father was considered to be a foreign national, not a U.S. citizen. Effectively, therefore, before 1994, U.S. fathers could pass on their citizenship to children born overseas, but U.S. mothers could not. Senator Simon sought to remedy this gender inequality by automatically granting U.S. citizenship to those individuals born overseas to U.S. mothers before 1934. Under his legislation, the Immigration and Nationality and Technical Corrections Act of 1994, the children of American mothers and foreign fathers became U.S. citizens. 
His legislation also contained language to address the third generation--the children of these children. It is likely that the grandchildren of the U.S. mothers and foreign fathers would have been U.S. citizens had their children been U.S. citizens. Therefore, the 1994 law also granted U.S. citizenship to these grandchildren. 
This provision granting citizenship to the grandchildren, however, contradicted another section of the Immigration and Nationality Act [INA]. INA states that in order to transmit U.S. citizenship from a parent to a child born overseas, the parent must have lived in the United States for 10 years. A U.S. citizen who has a child overseas needs to have lived in the United States over a 10-year period to pass on U.S. citizenship to his or her children. This transmission requirement is gender neutral, and applies to all U.S. citizens who have children overseas. 
Senator Simon's law did not specifically waive this transmission requirement for the third generation, although the language of the bill clearly stated that it intended to grant citizenship to the grandchildren of the American mothers. The lawyers at INS have concluded that the transmission requirement must be met in order to pass citizenship onto the grandchildren of the American mothers and foreign fathers. In other words, INS is requiring the third generation to show that the second generation lived in the United States for 10 years in order to pass citizenship to the third generation. 
This is impossible given that the second generation was never allowed to live in the United States because they were not citizens until 1994. Thus the provision of the 1994 law granting citizenship to these grandchildren was never implemented. 
The purpose of my bill is to waive the transmission requirement for the grandchildren of the American mothers and foreign fathers. The third generation will not have to show that the second generation lived in the United States for 10 years. They will be granted citizenship even though their parents did not live in the United States for 10 years. This bill will help a small number of people who should have been U.S. citizens by birth. It will ensure that the spirit of Senator Simon's legislation is enacted into law. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Thank you, very much, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, very much, and the Senator from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, for their efforts in bringing this nomination to the floor. 
Yesterday, I came to the floor and asked that Alexis Herman be freed and that the Department of Labor be liberated so that they could get on with the business of the American people, the American working people. And that is what has happened here. 
So we are rejoicing this afternoon that, indeed, this nomination has reached consensus. There has been closure and agreement by leadership and by the Members of this Senate to have a vote on Alexis Herman's confirmation. 
I am so very pleased and grateful to the leadership, and, again, Senator Kennedy and Senator Jeffords for making it so. 
Mr. President, I strongly support the confirmation of Alexis Herman as Secretary of Labor. She has been a friend of mine and I know that she will be an outstanding Secretary of Labor. Her commitment to improving the condition of America's working people is second to none. 
Over the past 4 years, we have witnessed major improvements in our economy. Now we must continue the work to make our economy and our work force better than we have ever known. We need someone to help lead us in that direction. I cannot think of a person who is more skilled and more knowledgeable and who is better suited for that task than Alexis Herman. 
Alexis Herman has long dedicated her efforts to putting all Americans to work. Early in her career, Alexis Herman implemented a program that provided targeted training to potential employees. This program helped to ensure that potential employees possessed the skills required to meet employer's needs. Through the work of Alexis Herman, companies across America had access to employees who had specialized skills, and workers had access to jobs because they were trained for jobs that actually existed. 
Alexis Herman continued her efforts to expand workplace opportunities as head of the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor under President Carter. At the Women's Bureau, she not only expanded job opportunities by training women for the work force, including training in nontraditional jobs, but also expanded job opportunities by training women to become business owners with a work force of their own. 
During her tenure at the Women's Bureau Alexis Herman focused her efforts on moving women from welfare to work. Especially important and relevant in light of last year's welfare bill is Alexis Herman's experience and skills in the area of creating job training and placement opportunities for welfare recipients and low-skill workers. If we are going to put over a million people to work in the coming years, we are going to need Alexis Herman's practical experience. 
Alexis Herman's commitment to diversity will make a difference in the steps our Nation takes to enhance our work force. Any time we retreat from providing equal opportunities to all of our citizens, we risk weakening our greatest asset: our workers. With her vast experience in increasing diversity in the workplace, Alexis Herman will ensure that no talent goes untapped. 
Alexis Herman knows the value of diversity. As public liaison for President Clinton, Ms. Herman worked with Americans across the country--Americans with diverse backgrounds and concerns. 
During Ms. Herman's testimony before the Labor Committee, she stated that she had five goals for the Labor Department in the next 4 years: lifelong learning and skills development; welfare to work; retirement security; safe and equal opportunity workplaces; and balancing work and family. These goals reflect her life's work to date. These goals also describe a course for the future that we can all support. These goals reflect America's agenda. 
Training our work force for the 21st century, providing for a secure retirement for the Nation's expanding elderly population, and recognizing the importance of family for America's work force are clearly national priorities. Alexis Herman understands that to reach these goals we must work together. 
One of her greatest strengths is that she has formed partnerships with both business and labor in her many years working on employment issues. She understands the kind of investment that business must make in human capital in order to improve productivity, increase profits, and to create jobs. She understands how difficult it is for small businesses to start up and how important those businesses are to our economy as a whole. She understands that people want to work but that they need the opportunity to be trained so that they can become productive members of the work force. And, finally, Alexis Herman understands that we are all in this together. 
Former Secretary Reich was an advocate for working people, an asset to the business community and a tireless servant for America's families. He has my deepest thanks and my highest admiration for the work he did as Secretary of Labor. But I know that Alexis Herman is capable and up to the task in front of her, that even though she has big shoes to fill, I know she is more than capable of meeting the challenge and finishing the task. There can be no better candidate for Secretary of Labor than Alexis Herman. Her confirmation, as Senator Kennedy pointed out, will, indeed, make history. As Secretary of Labor she will make a difference, however, in the lives of millions of Americans and workers throughout the world. 
I urge my colleagues to confirm Alexis Herman as the next Secretary of Labor. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, my message is very simple, following on the statement of the Senator from Massachusetts. That is, I call on the Senate to free Alexis Herman and liberate the Department of Labor. The fact is that her nomination is being held up for reasons that have nothing to do with her qualifications for office, or, more to the point, the need of the American people to have a captain of a ship, if you will, at the Department of Labor. 
It is being held up because of some unrelated political issues and, quite frankly, it demeans and, I think, embarrasses some in the U.S. Senate to have this high-profile and important nominee held hostage for no reason. 
So my message, in keeping with the message of the Senator from Massachusetts--and I associate myself with his remarks--is that I call upon the Members of the Senate to consider that Mrs. Herman's qualifications are exemplary. She has the leadership skills to lead this Department of Labor in the 21st century, to lead our country in addressing the needs of working men and women, as well as the transition that our business community is currently undergoing. I very much hope that our Members will come together to let this nomination go--free Alexis Herman and liberate the Department of Labor. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of the Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act because I do not believe we can sit idly by while senior citizens are charged excessive and unnecessary fees for seeking to access the equity in their homes. It is an unconscionable practice. 
The Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act provides basic consumer protections for working people in their senior years who want to obtain a reverse mortgage so that they may live with a level of economic security. Reverse mortgages benefit people who have worked their entire lives, have managed to buy their own homes, but who do not have much extra income to live on after they retire. 
Under a reverse mortgage, the owner of the home gives a lender a mortgage on the home. The homeowner receives either a lump sum of money or monthly payments in return. The funds do not have to be repaid until the home is sold or the homeowner dies. The FHA's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program guarantees these reverse mortgages. 
This is a good program for some seniors and one which the Government supports. Unfortunately, there are some who are taking advantage of seniors and charging them excessive fees to complete the reverse mortgage transactions, including fees of up to 10 percent of the loan amount. The way these scams work is that mortgagors will offer to serve as financial advisors to senior citizens and then charge them exorbitant fees for providing the seniors with public information about the HUD reverse mortgage program. 
Those seeking a reverse mortgage generally do not have much income to spare. The average borrower is 76 years old and has an annual income of $10,400. Charging a $10,000 fee for a $100,000 reverse mortgage, as is done, is highway robbery. 
The Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act is not complicated legislation. There are only two provisions. The first provision requires that the senior has received `full disclosure of all costs to the mortgagor for obtaining the mortgage, including any costs of estate planning, financial advice, or other related services.' This will provide seniors with the information they need to make sound judgments concerning the value of the services they are receiving. 
The second provision provides that the HUD secretary has the authority to impose restrictions to ensure that a lender does not charge excessive, or unwarranted costs to the borrower for providing a reverse mortgage. This is a basic protection that allows HUD to police the bad actors who are ruining reverse mortgages as an option for too many seniors. 
HUD tried to address the problem, but a court ruled that the department had to go through its normal procedure to issue a rule governing fees charged by the advisers. Formal rulemaking can take as long as 6 or 7 months. We do not have 6 or 7 months. Every day seniors face the prospect of losing part of the equity in their homes because these scams are allowed to continue. This legislation will put an end to the scams. 
I thank Senator D'Amato for introducing this bill, I am proud to be an original cosponsor, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the Senior Home Equity Protection Act so that we can quickly enact this simple but crucial legislation.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, in recent weeks we have heard a great deal about the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
We have talked about the risks of information sharing, the reliability of the verification systems, and whether Russia should go first. We have debated the dangers of exchanging inspectors, we have questioned whether outcasts like Iran, Iraq and North Korea should sign this international agreement, and whether anything would change if they did. Fundmentally, we have been considering whether the proposed treaty is a step forward, or whether it is worse than no treaty at all. 
Opponents have argued that the treaty is fatally flawed, and that the United States is better off without it. It's true that the Chemical Weapons Convention is not perfect. Chemical weapons are cheap and easy to make, and despite our best efforts, we will never be able to monitor every laboratory, or stop every nation in this world that is driven to make tools of biological warfare. 
But this debate is not about whether the treaty is perfect, or whether its provisions must be changed. This debate is about what happens if the United States fails to act. 
Every weapon of war is horrible. While the bloodshed, violence and destruction caused by things that kill people cannot be ranked, death by poison gases or viruses is particularly grisly. I am reminded of the words of Erich Maria Remarque in his novel about men lost to poison gas attacks during the Great War in the early part of this century: 
We found one dug-out full of them, with blue heads and black lips. Some . . . took their masks off too soon . . . they swallowed enough to scorch their lungs. Their condition is hopeless; they choke to death with hemorrhages and suffocation--`All Quiet on The Western Front' Erich Maria Remarque. 
It was experiences like this that helped to generate worldwide hatred and fear of chemical weapons, and is what led to the Geneva Protocol of 1925. 
In the 70 years since that time, negotiations have been conducted, conferences have been held, and agreements have been signed to permanently ban chemical weapons from the earth. It is universally recognized that outlawing chemical and biological weapons and their manufacture--while it might not completely prevent any use in future conflicts--is the right thing to do. 
That's why it is incredible to me, less than a week before the ratification deadline, that this treaty has become a point of political division here in the U.S. Senate. 
This treaty is the first global arms control agreement to ban an entire class of weapons. Participating states must destroy their chemical weapons within 10 years of the treaty's enactment and pledge to never make them again. The agreement also creates an international organization to monitor compliance, and signatories must exchange data and permit routine inspections of their facilities. 
Nations refusing to participate will be barred from purchasing the ingredients necessary to make chemical weapons and many commercial chemical products, and will face heightened scrutiny over their chemical weapons activities. Their chemical and biotechnology industries will face great international trade obstacles. 
Opponents of the Chemical Weapons Convention argue that this treaty should not be ratified because countries such as Iraq, Iran and Syria are not signatories. They argue that the treaty is unverifiable, that it is intrusive and damaging to confidential trade information held by the U.S. chemical industry, and that, due to the Clinton administration's refusal to modify article 10 and 11, the United States will be forced to share critical technology with other nations. 
I do not subscribe to this interpretation. The sanctions provided by this treaty for nonmembers were designed with the distinct understanding that pariah states were unlikely to join the agreement, and therefore would be isolated and targeted for sanctions. Furthermore, article 10 does not obligate the United States to share chemical defense technologies and equipment with member or nonmember states. Article 10, in fact, provides the United States with the flexibility to determine how and what types of assistance should be provided to signatories. Article 11 will not force private businesses to release proprietary information. The convention legally binds signatories, via article 1, never to engage in any activities prohibited under the convention, greatly decreasing the likelihood that nations would seek to profit by giving secrets to non-signatories. 
For the American people, the benefits of the Chemical Weapons Convention are clear. Its provisions will diminish the threat of chemical warfare against our young troops overseas. It will help protect Americans at home from terrorist attacks like the kind that occurred in the Tokyo subway. And it gives us new tools to help us track down and punish nations that violate this treaty. 
The amount of good that this treaty can accomplish has been recognized by the rest of the civilized world. One hundred and sixty-four nations have signed, and seventy-four nations have ratified this agreement. The treaty, which was negotiated by the Republican administrations of Reagan and Bush, has been endorsed by military leaders like General Powell and General Schwartzkopf. It's supported by the chemical manufacturers, and most significantly, it is supported by the American people. 
The Senate has less than 1 week, however, to ratify this treaty. If we miss the April 29 deadline, the world will move ahead without us, and the United States will lose a critical opportunity to take a stand against the worldwide proliferation of chemical weapons. America will lose its seat at the table in the international enforcement process, and American inspectors will be barred from examining foreign facilities. Our chemical industry will lose hundreds of millions of dollars per year as a result of the treaty's trade restrictions. And we will sit on the sidelines with outlaw nations like Libya, North Korea, Iraq, and Iran. 
The United States is not an outlaw nation, and should not be considered one because of our failure to act. We cannot stop these deadly weapons alone, and the world cannot stop these weapons without us. As President Clinton said in his State of the Union Address, `We must be shapers of events, not observers.' If we want to continue our leadership role into the next century, then it is time for the United States to be leagued with the rest of the world and put an end to these weapons of death. 
We have a clear choice. We can take the path of political partisanship, and stand in isolation. Or we can set aside discord, take responsibility for our children's future, and ratify this agreement. 
This is the decision that the Senate must make. In the 100 years since the Hague Conventions, a historic opportunity is within reach to ban chemical weapons forever. It is time for the Senate to complete the job and ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, particularly as we are talking about tax day, I think it is important, also, to talk about something that, as Americans, we can celebrate together on this day. 
Today marks the anniversary of an important day in American history. Today is the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's dismantling of the color barrier in major league baseball. It might even be said that his actions, in so doing, were the beginning of the dismantling of American apartheid and the system of Jim Crow segregation that kept us apart in this country. I know for a fact that I would not be here in the U.S. Senate today had it not been for the achievement of Jackie Robinson. I daresay that the victory of Tiger Woods in the Masters, which every American celebrated, I think, would not have happened had it not been for Jackie Robinson's achievement. 
It was 50 years ago that Jackie Robinson became a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers, making history by opening doors that had previously been closed to African American athletes. The year 1997 also marks the year that major league baseball owners agreed to give pensions to several baseball players who played in the then-segregated Negro Leagues. Many of those players followed in the path that was blazed by Jackie Robinson, but they were ineligible for major league pensions. The fact that the owners fixed that this year again is reason for us to celebrate. 
Mr. President, there are few Americans today who do not know of Jackie Robinson, the baseball great whose talent and pursuit of excellence enabled him to break the color barrier 50 years ago. Jackie Robinson began his baseball career in 1945 as a Negro League player after serving his country in World War II. The following year he joined the minor league operation of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and was named the Minor League Most Valuable Player. In 1947, he was brought up to play in the major leagues, and was named 1947's Rookie of the Year. Two years later, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player. In 1962, Jackie Robinson became the first African-American named to Baseball's Hall of Fame. 
Jackie Robinson's legacy, however, is not restricted to that of a sports legend, or even a civil rights pioneer. Today I want to talk about some of his many achievements off the baseball field. While playing professional baseball, Jackie Robinson served as an inspiration to many people of the heights they could achieve. Upon his retirement, he was determined to make a real difference in the quality of the lives of others. As founder of the Jackie Robinson Development Corp. and the Freedom National Bank, he was able to provide access to capital and affordable housing to low income families in the underserved community of Harlem. 
Even today, his good works continue through his widow, Rachel Robinson, who started the Jackie Robinson Foundation 1 year after his death. The Foundation provides full 4-year college scholarships for minority and disadvantaged young people. The recipients are chosen based on academic strength, community service, leadership potential and financial need. There have been over 400 Jackie Robinson scholars from across the country with a 92 percent graduation rate. 
In order to celebrate these achievements, Senator D'Amato and I led the effort to mint a commemorative coin in honor of Jackie Robinson. I am delighted that this legislation passed and that the Jackie Robinson Foundation will benefit from profits earned by the coin. Minting will begin later this year. 
Jackie Robinson's extraordinary successes were the result of phenomenal talent and determination. While much of the world knows of Jackie Robinson's success, we must not forget the African-American baseball players who played in the Majors and helped integrate the game, yet did not receive the recognition for their contribution to the game, nor, for that matter, receive a pension for their time in the Majors. 
Last year, I became aware of the plight of Sam Jethroe, a former major league ball player whose career in baseball began in the Negro League. Sam 
Jethroe, born in East St. Louis, IL, on January 20, 1922, began playing for the Cleveland Buckeyes, a Negro League team, at the age of 20. He played for the Buckeyes for seven seasons, and was one of the recognized stars of the Negro League. 
A switch-hitting outfielder who threw right-handed, Jethroe was christened `Jet' for running so fast; opposing teams actually worked at strategies to slow him down. Sam Jethroe was also a good hitter; he batted .300 during his time with the Buckeyes and he led the Negro League in hitting in 1942, 1944, and 1945. 
Although African-Americans had previously been banned from the major leagues, Mr. Jethroe was given a try-out with the Boston Red Sox in 1945. He wasn't signed onto a major league team, however, until 1949, 2 years after Jackie Robinson's historic appearance in the league. At that time, Mr. Jethroe became the first African-American baseball player on the Boston--now Atlanta--Braves and debuted on their team in 1950. He was their starting center fielder. 
In 1950, Sam Jethroe won the base-stealing crown, with 35, scored 100 runs, and batted .273, with 18 homers and 58 RBI's. As a result he was named National League Rookie of the Year in 1950, the third African-American to capture the honor in 4 years, following Jackie Robinson and pitcher Don Newcombe. In 1951, Sam Jethroe was even better. He repeated his stolen base title win and batted .280, with 101 runs scored, 29 doubles, 10 triples, 18 homers, and 65 RBI's. 
After spending 1953 in the minors, Mr. Jethroe completed a successful career in baseball by playing two games with the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
At the time that Sam Jethroe played baseball, a player needed 4 years of service in the major leagues in order to qualify for a pension. As you may know, players active since 1980 need only 1 year in the majors to qualify. Because Sam Jethroe fell short of the 4-year requirement, he has never received a pension. I believe that Mr. Jethroe would have qualified for a pension; that is, he would have played more than 4 years in major league baseball had it not been for the fact that he was banned from baseball because of the color of his skin. 
The misfortune of the ban was compounded by the change of vesting rules for pension eligibility. Sam Jethroe is now 74 years old, and does not enjoy a secure retirement. 
Pension security goes to the heart of our challenge to treat the end of life as the golden years rather than the disposable years. Retirement security has been likened to a three legged stool. Social security, private pensions, and personal savings constitute the basis of an income stream for the later years of life. While Sam Jethroe was eligible for social security benefits, he had limited savings, and did not receive a pension for his years in major league baseball. 
Sam Jethroe's compelling story prompted me to contact Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox to see if anything could be done to help Sam Jethroe and Negro League veterans suffering from similar circumstances. 
Mr. Reinsdorf took the initiative and raised the issue of pension protection with other owners for those people who were excluded from major league baseball prior to the breaking down of the barriers by Jackie Robinson. 
In 1997, the owners decided to provide pensions to the African-Americans who played solely in the Negro leagues before 1948, as well as those who played both in the Negro leagues and in the major leagues. I would like to commend Jerry Reinsdorf for his help in this matter. Sam Jethroe and the other Negro League players would not have received this long-awaited relief had it not been for him. 
I also want to commend the owners for the tremendous good will and propriety of their decision. They recognized an injustice and fixed it. It is fitting that major league baseball recognize the contributions of these fine athletes in the year that we recognize and celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's historic breakthrough in major league baseball. 
So, Mr. President, in summary, I would like to say that there is good news today, the 15th of April. Not only did Jackie Robinson 50 years ago help open up doors in America, but he helped to change hearts. Fifty years ago, after the owners of major league baseball debated whether or not to let people of color play America's game, they made a decision that America's game would take care of one of its own. It seems to me to be an essential American story, that in 50 years' time we have seen enough change in this country, given rise by the sacrifice, the commitment, and the excellence pursued by Jackie Robinson and those like him who opened up doors. Now, 50 years later, those doors have been opened, and the hearts of many Americans have, indeed, been changed. 
I think that is good news for today that we can all celebrate.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, and my colleague from Montana, Senator Conrad Burns, in introducing S. 573, the Loan Interest Forgiveness for Education Act, the LIFE Act. One of the major forces driving this bill is our growing concern that parents and students in this country have access to a quality education without amassing enormous student loan bills. 
The cost of college has a direct impact on access to college. The more tuition goes up, the more students will be priced out of their opportunity for the American dream. Our country will suffer the loss of talent and training. We cannot as a nation prepare for the 21st century by making it more difficult for our children to access higher education. 
This Congress is working hard to eliminate the Federal deficit. In part, this is because we know that piling on more debt ultimately undermines the ability of the generations that follow us to achieve the American dream, and to do what we have done--live better than our parents. Mr. President, that is why we are introducing this LIFE bill. It will do two things: encourage individuals to go to college, and reduce the cost of a college education. I believe very strongly, Mr. President, that the way to achieve this dream is to ensure that everyone who is in need of financial assistance to attend an institution of higher learning has that opportunity. They should have the opportunity, as we did, to pursue their dreams. 
It is absolutely essential that we continue to invest in our most important asset--our children. That is what the Loan Interest Forgiveness for Education Act is all about. The bill will create a deduction for qualified student loan interest including expenses for interest paid on student loans used to pay postsecondary education expenses such as tuition, books, room and board. This bill is similar to provisions contained in both the Republican and Democratic leadership education bills, S. 1 and S. 12, and is also similar to a provision passed by Congress as part of the 1995 Budget Reconciliation Act. 
As you may know, President Clinton has proposed a bill to 
allow a $1,500 tax credit per year for the first 2 years of college or a $10,000 deduction per person per year for qualified college tuition expense. I am glad to see President Clinton focus on investing in education for the middle class because it is truly our only hope of remaining competitive in this global marketplace. However, I believe we should go even further by investing in those working parents too, who would otherwise not be able to send their children to college without loans. 
The median income for a family of four as reported by the Joint Committee on Taxation in 1995 was $49,531. If that household income was comprised entirely of wage or salary income and, if that household filed a joint return claiming the standard deduction and four personal exemptions, the household's income tax liability would have been $4,947 and a total payroll tax liability of $7,578 resulting in a total tax liability of $12,525. When considering the tax liability and the limited income of the median household family, a large number of American families will not have the extra income to save $80,000 for two children to go to college. 
This legislation will focus on those that do not have parents who can afford to save for college. Those working parents who can barely afford to make ends meet; parents who provide the basics of life such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical insurance for their children but do not make the extra income to save for college. Even if families could afford to save the money to pay for their children's college education, income tax liability of many families is not high enough to benefit from the President's proposal because neither the $10,000 tax deduction nor $1,500 tax credit is refundable. 
Students whose parents are unable to pay for college up front are generally the ones who rely more heavily on student loans to pay for college and should be given the same type of tax relief as those that come from families that can afford to finance the costs of a college education from savings. That is why the Loan Interest Forgiveness for Education Act, or the LIFE Act, helps not only to improve the life of students who might not otherwise have the opportunity to attend college, it also helps to improve their life after graduation. These students generally have an enormous burden of debt and the interest costs impair their ability to get started in life after college. New college graduates just beginning their careers all too often have to pay a higher percentage of their income in educational loan bills than they do in rent. 
I believe we should encourage individuals who cannot afford to pay for college to realize that education is a wise investment in their future. Although some individuals must incur substantial debt to complete their education, the Government should do their part to make sure that these students will not suffer because of this decision for the next 20 years of their lives. 
The Government uses the Tax Code to help American families buy their own homes. It is equally important to use the Tax Code to encourage higher education. It is an investment in our children, our economy and our future. If a child receives a college education, that person is much more likely to be able to afford to purchase a home. The link between educational attainment and earnings is unquestionable. Statistics show that the average earnings of the most educated Americans are 600 percent greater than that of the least educated Americans. The Department of Labor estimates that, by the year 2000, more than half of all new jobs will require an education beyond high school. As we move nearer to the 21st century and into an information-driven economy, the gap between high school and college graduates is growing. A college graduate in 1980 earned 43 percent more per hour than a high school graduate. By 1994, that had increased to 73 percent. When we reduce access to higher education, we reduce access to the American Dream. 
Given the fact that many of the people in the young generation are going to be pushed into the ocean of responsibility to pay off our national debt, and pay higher Social Security taxes to support us, the least that we could do, Mr. President, is to provide them with a life-preserver. It is the ethical thing to do and the right thing to do. This life-preserver that I speak of, Mr. President, is education. By supporting this educational initiative we are affording members of this young generation and others a chance to arm themselves with knowledge as well as enhance their income potential. This is very important because most economist agree that education produces substantial spillover, which simply means indirect effects, that will benefit society in general. Examples cited of such positive spillover effects include a more efficient work force, lower unemployment rates, lower welfare costs, and less crime. All of these are issues that concern us greatly. Furthermore, an educated electorate is said to foster a more responsive and effective government. So as you can see this bill is very timely. 
This bill comes at a time when the cost of attending an institution of higher learning has increased at a rate higher than inflation. In the 1980's, for example, the cost of a year's tuition at a publicly supported college increased from $635 to $1,454, an increase of almost 130 percent. And a year's tuition at a private college increased from an average of $3,498 to $8,772, an increase of 150 percent. A more recent figure can be found in the state of Illinois where, as of 1994, students at Northern Illinois University and Illinois State University, both public institutions, were paying nearly 96 percent more than the increase in the inflationary rate for that same year. The number of loans borrowed through the main Federal college loan programs rose by nearly 50 percent since 1990, from 4,493,000 in 1990 to 6,672,000 in 1995. Rapid increases in college tuition force today's students to borrow much more than their predecessors did, yet in 1986, the interest deduction for student loans was eliminated. 
I am working with the GAO, [Government Accounting Office] to further investigate why college tuition is rising so rapidly, and what the Federal Government can most appropriately do about this problem. One of the arguments against providing up front tax cuts to parents for the costs of education is that tuition costs will increase to take into account the tax benefit given to parents. However, the Loan Interest Forgiveness for Education Act will not increase the cost of tuition because the benefit will be received after individuals have graduated. This bill will improve the life of college graduates while at the same time encouraging them to pay back their student loans. 
We must improve the accessibility of education, so that all Americans may receive a higher education, not just the wealthy elite. 
It is a critical matter in terms of the opportunities than this generation of Americans will have to access and maintain the American dream. The fact that Americans depend on people being able to make a living and support themselves, and to reach as high as their talents will take them, should not be hampered in any way by the limitation of availability of educational opportunity because of costs. 
I know that I would not be in the Senate today were it not for quality public education and the accessibility of affordable higher education. The Chicago Public Schools gave me a solid foundation, and I was able to attend the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago in spite of the fact of that my parents were working-class people. I am committed to seeing that the students of this generation and those who follow them have even greater opportunities than I have had. I am absolutely determined to ensure that the exploding cost of college does not close the door to opportunity for them. Our generation has an absolute duty to keep the door open, and to preserve and enhance the opportunity for a better life and the American dream for the 21st century. 
Certainly this generation should not have to bear a burdensome loan portfolio when they graduate that keeps them from making other optimal economic choices. 
So, Mr. President, I introduce this legislation. I send it to the desk, and I encourage my colleagues to consider cosponsorship of it. I hope that by tax day next year we are able to provide those students who are going to college and have taken on loans the opportunity to have some loan forgiveness once they graduate.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan, and Senator Lautenberg, Senator Lieberman, and many others today to introduce the ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997. This law builds on the success of the last 6 years of ISTEA, and will guide more than $175 billion in Federal highway spending over the next 6 years. 
Few laws we enact this year will have as much of an immediate and significant affect on our economy than the ISTEA reauthorization bill. The transportation industry employs 12 million people, consumes 20 percent of total household spending, and accounts for 11 percent of our Nation's total economic activity. Highways are the most important component of our transportation infrastructure, and their use is growing. Between 1984 and 1994, U.S. motor vehicle travel increased 37.5 percent. 
Over the past 6 years, the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act has provided the basis for a strong Federal-State-local partnership to help the Nation meet its transportation needs. It has directed $157 billion into highways, mass transit, and related transportation priorities nationwide. It is one of the most successful intergovernmental partnerships in American history. Under ISTEA, we completed the system of Interstate and Defense Highways begun by President Eisenhower 40 years ago, defined the National Highway System that will help prioritize highway improvements for decades to come, and coordinated planning among different transportation modes. 
ISTEA has improved the capacity and overall condition of our transportation infrastructure. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, our highways and bridges are in better shape than they were a few years ago. Our environment is in better condition too, thanks to ISTEA innovations like the congestion mitigation and air quality and transportation enhancement programs. 
Despite our success, we continue to face enormous challenges over the next 6 years to maintain and improve our highways and bridges. Over this time, it will cost an estimated $148.5 billion just to maintain the current physical conditions of our highways. Every year, we must renew 100,000 miles of highways in order to maintain current pavement conditions. 
My own State of Illinois will need several billion dollars to repair aging roads and bridges. According to some estimates, nearly 43 percent of Illinois roads need repair, and almost one-fourth of Illinois bridges are in substandard condition. Every year, Illinois motorists pay an estimated $1 billion in vehicle wear and tear and other expenses associated with poor road conditions. 
In Chicago, the transportation hub of the Nation, the traffic flow on some of the major arterial highways has increased seven-fold since they were built in the 1950's and 1960's. According to a recent study, Chicago is the fifth most congested city in the Nation. The typical Chicago-area driver wastes 34 hours every year sitting still in traffic jams, and pays $470 a year in lost time and wasted fuel. 
In order to meet the transportation infrastructure needs of Illinois and the Nation, the Federal Government must continue to play a lead role in the ongoing partnership to improve America's highways. If there were ever a legislative case in point for the saying, `If it's not broken, don't fix it,' ISTEA is it. 
The ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997 is a simple bill. It builds on the success of the last 6 years. It does not represent a set of major policy changes. It provides a significant increase in funding over ISTEA levels, updates some of the funding formulas, and increases flexibility for States, all within the constructs defined by ISTEA. I hope the Environment and Public Works Committee will use this bill as the basis for its deliberations on ISTEA reauthorization, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us in sponsoring this important legislation. 
I want to point out that this legislation does not reauthorize the mass transit half of ISTEA. That job falls on the Banking Committee. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the committee and with others who have a strong interest in transit to ensure the next 6 years of transit policy also mirror the successful framework of transit policy defined by ISTEA. 
As we head into the 21st century, we must continue to maintain and improve America's transportation infrastructure. In the global economy, one of the things that makes our products competitive is our ability to move freight across the country cheaply and efficiently. The ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997 will accomplish that goal by continuing the success of ISTEA into the next 6 years.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today, April 11, is national pay inequity awareness day. Today we recognize that women are still earning less than 75 cents for every dollar that a man earns and that this pay differential has a long-lasting negative impact on women and on the Nation. 
Women earn less than men. In 1981, a woman earned just 60 cents for every dollar a man earned. We have made progress and today women are earning about 71 cents on the dollar. In Illinois that number is just 66 cents for every dollar, but even this is progress. Nonetheless the remaining inequity is unacceptable. 
Besides the basic equity issue, the fact that women earn less than men is unacceptable for three reasons: women comprise over half the population, women contribute to family income in over half of all American families, and women live longer than men. 
Women make up over half the population and that means that pay inequities affect the majority of the American people. Employers continue routinely to pay lower wages on jobs that women dominate and in many cases women receive less pay for performing the same work as men. Women in the American work force are not only met with the challenge of breaking through a glass ceiling, but also a glass wall. 
Women are breadwinners in over half of all American families. The fact that over a lifetime, this difference in pay can equal over a quarter of a million dollars has a direct impact on America's families--families struggling to send their children to school, to pay their mortgages, 
to save for retirement. Women who receive 71 cents on the dollar in wages are not able to pay 71 cents on the dollar for groceries or child care. Equal pay is a survival issue for America's families. 
Women live longer than men. Women are going to spend more years in retirement and will have to make their fixed incomes stretch even further. The impact of lower lifetime earnings mean that only a third of female retirees today earn private pension benefits and the median pension benefit for women is half that of men's. In addition, while Social Security covers most female retirees, women's benefits are lower than men's. Even with full benefits, Social Security was never meant to provide for a secure retirement, it is only a floor. Today, women make up three-quarters of the elderly poor because they continue to earn less in retirement. 
Women make up the majority of the population, are breadwinners in the majority of families and live longer than men. These facts combined with the reality of women's lower earnings result in a system of inequity that hurts America's families. 
It is for these reasons that I joined my colleagues in sponsoring a sense-of-the-Senate amendment recognizing the important contributions women make to our country, recognizing the strides that employers have made in the area, and calling on all employers to address the issue of equal pay in their workplaces so that America's families can prosper. This is a resolution I believe we can all support. 
I am also the cosponsor of legislation in this Congress that will make it easier for women to challenge unfair pay practices and for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to pursue cases of unequal compensation. This legislation is a basic remedy for a problem we all agree should not exist. I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring S. 71.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, a recent gathering of millionaires and billionaires at an economic conference in Switzerland underscored the importance of education in the global economy of the new millennium. In this information age, they concluded, the distinction between the haves and have nots will be the distinction between the knows and know nots. As it is with individuals, so it is with nations. 
We have documented the difference that education credentials make in the average earnings of American workers. High school graduates make 46 percent more every year than those who do not graduate. College graduates earn 155 percent more every year than those who do not complete high school. Over the course of a lifetime, the most educated Americans will earn five times as much as the least educated. 
Access to quality public education has been the cornerstone of the American meritocracy, providing people with more talent than means with the opportunity for economic success in most fields of endeavor. The rungs on the ladder of opportunity are crafted in the classroom. 
To focus solely on the individual advantage of educational opportunity, however, is to miss the point of its importance to society as a whole. Education is a public good, not just a private benefit, and its relevance to the community transcends its importance to the person. It directly correlates to almost every indicia of societal well-being. Health status, support for the arts and cultural activities, and participation in our democratic institutions increase with educational attainment; while social instability, pathologies, and demand for transfer payments increase in its absence. We all have a direct and personal stake in the availability of educational opportunity for every child. 
The conference in Switzerland, however, touched on yet another aspect of the public value of education--its role in the development of a work force prepared for the external changes technology has created. It has been argued the United States was able to beat the global competition in the industrial age because of the high quality of our work force. It is an open question whether we will continue to enjoy such advantage in the information age. In this international competition, older industrial societies will find themselves in direct competition with the second-, third-, and even fourth-world societies that may have skipped industrialization altogether. We can choose 
either to compete with cheap labor worldwide and guarantee a decline in living standards here, or we can ensure that our work force has the high-skill, sophisticated productivity that will command a living wage in this global economy. It was very interesting to me that during the recent debate about immigration, some of the most influential voices against restricting legal immigration came from Silicon Valley and the high-technology business community: They argued there was a shortage of American workers trained for their work, and they would be unable to maintain their competitive position if limited in the option of importing talent, so the need to educate our work force, as a society and a country, has never been more important. 
And so we are faced with a challenge of more monumental proportions than ever before. President Clinton recently referred to education as central to our national security. Yet, we still approach education generally, and education funding in particular, with the perspective of an age long past. Schools are still paid for primarily through the local property tax. Elementary and secondary education has long been almost the exclusive preserve of State and local government, and there has traditionally been a resistance to the National Government having anything to do with the circumstances in which Johnny learns to read. 
Such a view misses the changes that have transformed the world and brought us closer together. We have, now more than ever, a community interest that calls for cooperation among and between all of the instruments of our collective will. National, State, and local governments all have a role to play in funding education. All must do so if we are to respond to the imperative of educational opportunity and excellence in our own enlightened self interest. 
Jonathan Kozol, in his important work `Savage Inequalities,' spoke to the effects of tying educational opportunity to property wealth. Disparities are created that fly in the face of America's promise of equality of opportunity. Moreover, the local property tax is a poor basis for educational funding: It is inelastic; it is not progressive; it has no relation to the function being supported; and it ties the fate of Johnny's schools to Grandma's fixed income. State governments have not corrected this funding anomaly. A recent report by the U.S. General Accounting Office [GAO] quantifies the inequities of the current mix of State and local tax support of schools and found not only the disparity based on 
wealth that Kozol exposed, but an even further perversity: Those communities which had the least in terms of property wealth tried the hardest to support their schools by devoting a greater portion of their income to education. 
When one considers, in addition, that there is--again, according to the GAO--at least $112 billion in deferred maintenance on the school buildings alone, the magnitude of our education funding challenge becomes clear. That $112 billion for infrastructure will simply address our crumbling school problem; it does not put the new technologies into the classroom or train teachers to use them or pay for the increased phone bills for computer use. 
What should be clear is that the answer is not either/or, but all. There are appropriate roles for all of our governments, at the national, State, and local levels. We should emphasize cooperation and collaboration between them, with each taking the responsibility most appropriate to resources and capacity. I have suggested the National Government take up the rebuilding of our crumbling schools, not only because the price tag is so huge, and the problem widespread and pervasive in city, suburban, and rural communities across the Nation, but because it is something the National Government can do without interfering with local decision making, such as which part of the school to fix first. 
In the meantime, we should all welcome the debate occurring at the State houses and city councils and boards of education all over America. We should be proud that our President made education the cornerstone of his State of the Union Address. We should be optimistic that our generation has the capacity to address and resolve the challenges of our time, and that we can translate all of the tension and concern about this issue into reality-based solutions. 
We must start, however, as the Earth Day slogan advises, by `Thinking Globally and Acting Locally.' The answers will be plain and the balance apparent when we consider the implications of this challenge for our Nation's future. The chairman of the OECD, Jean-Claude Paye, once said: `Leaders worried about their economies need to focus on society's fraying fabric.' 
Our attention to education funding reform is a first step in grasping the challenge of our time, and as we restore our Nation's schools, the permanence of the American dream will become more secure. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the founders of our Nation's civil rights movement, Arnie Aronson on the occasion of his 86th birthday. 
Mr. Aronson began his fight against discrimination in 1941. He headed the Bureau on Jewish Employment Problems in Chicago, Illinois. At that time discrimination against Jews was overt and widespread. Oftentimes help wanted ads stated `Gentile Only" need apply. Realizing that employment discrimination was a prevalent problem that affected people of all races, he organized the Chicago Council Against Religious and Racial Discrimination, a coalition of religious, labor, ethnic, civil rights, and social welfare agencies. As Council Secretary, Mr. Aronson directed the campaign that led to the first Municipal Fair Employment Practices Commission in the Nation. 
He went on to form a statewide coalition, the Illinois Fair Employment Council which initiated the Illinois campaign for fair employment practices legislation. Due to his experience in the area of employment discrimination he served as a consultant to other states that sought similar legislation. 
From 1945 until 1976, Mr. Aronson served as the Program Director for the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council, a coalition of national and Jewish agencies. He helped develop policies and programs for Jewish agency involvement on issues of civil rights, civil liberties, immigration reform, church/state separation, Soviet Jewish emigration, and support for Israel. 
In 1949, Mr. Aronson served as Secretary of the National Emergency Civil Rights Mobilization. This group was formed to lobby in support of President Truman's proposed civil rights program. The Mobilization consisted of approximately 5,000 delegates from 32 states representing 58 national organizations. At the time, it was described as the `greatest mass lobby in point of numbers and geographical distribution' that ever came to Washington. 
In 1950, Mr. Aronson helped found the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, one of the nation's leading civil rights organizations. He served as Secretary of the Conference from 1950 to 1980. In addition to being responsible for the overall administration of the Conference, he helped plan and coordinate the campaign that resulted in the enactment of the first civil rights laws since Reconstruction, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. During Mr. Aronson's tenure with the Conference, he helped contribute to some of the Conference's most productive years. 
I could go on, Mr. President, for there is no shortage of achievements, but I think that these few examples are sufficient to illustrate what an extraordinary contribution Arnie Aronson has made to the civil rights of our Nation. It is no exaggeration to say that millions of men and women of all races--who may never know Arnie Aronson--have benefited directly from his dedication and personal sacrifice on behalf of civil and human rights. He has made a positive and constructive difference for our Nation. I am pleased to wish him a belated happy 86th birthday.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today the Labor Committee is considering the nomination of Alexis Herman to be Secretary of Labor. Alexis Herman has been a friend and a colleague for many years. I believe she would make an outstanding Secretary of Labor. She has always shown the leadership, good judgment, and high principles that the job requires. Her commitment to improving the condition of America's working people is second to none. 
Alexis Herman has long dedicated her efforts to putting all Americans to work. She began her career by bringing together workers needing employment and employers needing workers. She did this by providing relevant, necessary training for potential employees so that they possessed the skills needed by employers. 
Through her work, companies across America had access to employees who had the specific skills necessary for each company's particular jobs, and the people she trained were able to obtain work because they were trained for positions that actually existed. 
As you know, she went on to head the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor under President Carter. Her work there included helping displaced homemakers enter the work force, increasing opportunities for women to apprentice in skilled trades, and promoting women-owned businesses, something that has received strong bipartisan support in the Congress. 
I would like especially to highlight her efforts at the Women's Bureau to provide job training opportunities for welfare recipients. Now, more than ever, we need to promote practical policies for putting people to work. Last year's welfare bill will mean that a flood of untrained, unskilled people will be searching desperately for work, or their families will go hungry. Without skills and training, however, their prospects for finding a job are bleak. 
We need Alexis Herman's practical experience working with employers and employees in the coming years if we are to put over a million people to work. 
Alexis Herman's commitment to diversity will also enhance our work force. We, in this Nation, have the best work force in this world. Any time we retreat from providing equal opportunities to all of our citizens, however, we risk weakening our greatest asset, our workers. If we fail to utilize the talents of all of our people, we sell ourselves short as a nation. With her vast experience in increasing diversity in the workplace, Alexis Herman will ensure that no talent goes untapped. 
In addition, as public liaison for President Clinton, Ms. Herman worked with Americans across the country--Americans with diverse backgrounds and concerns. She has served as a liaison with these many diverse groups and the President so successfully, because she is interested in, sympathetic to, and able to work with, the full spectrum of the American people. 
I would also like to note Ms. Herman's commitment to continue the work of Secretary Reich in enhancing pension security. I have spent the last several years focusing on retirement security for all Americans, and for women in particular. Secretary Reich was a strong ally and we are beginning to make progress. Retirement security is one of the most important issues for our time, with baby boomers turning 50 every 9 seconds. If we allow a generation to retire into poverty, the Nation will lose a generation of consumers and gain a generation of dependents; an outcome that no one wants. I am confident that Alexis Herman's talent and experience will propel the efforts to improve retirement security forward and I would welcome the opportunity to work with her on this issue. 
I would like to emphasize that I believe that one of Ms. Herman's greatest strengths is that she has formed partnerships with both business and labor in her many years working on employment issues. She understands the kind of investment business must make in human capital to improve productivity, increase profits, and create new jobs. She understands how difficult it is for small businesses to start up, and also how important these small businesses are to the economy as a whole. She understands that people want to work, and that they need the opportunity to be trained so that they can become productive members of the work force. She understands that we are all in this together. 
Alexis Herman has spent many years serving the people and the country. I believe that there could be no better candidate for Secretary of Labor than Alexis Herman. She is an outstanding public servant. Her confirmation will make history; as Secretary of Labor she will make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans and workers throughout the world. I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Alexis Herman to be Secretary of Labor and I look forward to her rapid confirmation. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I send to the desk, and I am pleased to introduce, along with a number of my colleagues, the Partnership To Rebuild America's School Act of 1997. This legislation is designed to address one of the most fundamental problems that we currently face as a nation with regard to public elementary and secondary education: many of our schools are literally falling down around our children. This legislation will help us address this problem, the crisis of crumbling schools in America. 
On Friday, the President officially transmitted this legislation to the Congress. The bill is the result of months of work by the Department of Education, the Department of the Treasury, the White House, my office, and a number of other congressional offices. 
At the outset, I commend and thank everyone who has participated in the development of this legislation for their efforts. 
Mr. President, the Partnership To Rebuild America's Schools Act of 1997 will help States and local school districts finance the repair, renovation, modernization and construction of their schools. States and school districts will be able to use the Federal funds to assist them in financing their highest priority projects. 
This bill will allow school districts to do more of what they need to be doing, educating our children for the 21st century. 
In America, the rungs on the ladder of opportunity are still crafted in the classroom. High school graduates earn, on average, 46 percent more every year than those who do not graduate. College graduates earn 155 percent more every year than those who do not graduate from high school. Over the course of a lifetime, the most educated Americans will earn five times as much as the least educated. 
Education, however, is not just a matter of individual benefit. It is a public good as well. It affects and correlates to the status and the quality of life for our entire community. It correlates to just about every indicia of economic and social well-being. Educational attainment can be directly tied to income, health, the likelihood of being on welfare, the likelihood of being incarcerated, and the likelihood of voting and participating in our democracy. Education, therefore, has both national as well as individual implications. 
In a recent Wall Street Journal survey of leading U.S. economists, 43 percent of those surveyed said the single most important thing that we could do to increase our long-term economic growth rate would be to invest more in education and research and development. Nothing else even came close to education in the survey. One economist said, `One of the few things that economists will agree upon is the fact that economic growth is very strongly dependent on our own abilities.' 
In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton noted that education is a critical national security issue for our future. I believe this notion should be at the heart of our debate over education. 
In order to compete with cheap, Third World labor in a global economy, in an information age, and to maintain the standard of living to which we have grown accustomed as Americans, we will have to have a work force that works smarter, that works better, that can hold its own in this global economy at the high end of the productivity scale. 
So education then becomes a matter of national concern and, indeed, as the President pointed out, a matter of our national security, because it is directly linked to our ability to be able to maintain the standard of living that we have come to appreciate as Americans and our ability to compete in this global marketplace. 
We all have a role to play. That is why this legislation starts off calling itself a partnership, because there must be a partnership between State, local and National Government to meet the challenge that this global economy, and changes in the world, have given us all to face. 
The Partnership To Rebuild America's Schools Act of 1997 will help us to meet the challenge by investing in education in ways that preserve the fundamental tenet of local control of education. 
By investing in bricks and mortar the Federal Government can contribute to a more balanced partnership among all levels of Government and in the private sector to rebuild and modernize our schools so they can serve all of our children in the 21st century. This legislation strikes that balance. This legislation does preserve local control, but, much to the point, it says that we at the national level have an obligation to participate in addressing those needs that can be most appropriately addressed at the national level; and that is rebuilding our crumbling schools. 
The bill uses 5 billion Federal dollars to leverage an additional $15 billion worth of State, local and private resources. Half of the money will be apportioned to States using the existing Title I basic grants formula. The remainder will flow directly to 
the 100 school districts in the country with the largest numbers of children living below the poverty level. 
Of the amount available for direct assistance to these impoverished communities, the Department of Education will apportion 70 percent by formula and will make the remaining 30 percent available on a competitive basis. 
In addition, the bill will allocate 2 percent of the funds to the Secretary of the Interior for administration to Indian schools and to the Secretary of Education for the outlying territories. 
Under both the State and local programs, States and school districts would have an enormous amount of flexibility in the use of these Federal funds to help finance school improvement projects. They could use the funds to subsidize State or local bond issues, certificates of participation, purchase or lease agreements, or other financial transactions used to finance school improvements. 
In addition, the States would be allowed to capitalize on entities similar to the State infrastructure banks which are currently used by a number of States to help finance highway improvement projects. These infrastructure banks could be used to leverage additional resources. 
This program is designed to stimulate new construction and renovation, and there are specific provisions in the bill to ensure that Federal funds are not used simply to finance school improvements that would have occurred anyway. The bill is designed to fill a real need that exists at both the State and local levels for school financing assistance, not to supplement districts that would have otherwise been able to finance their projects. 
It is carefully crafted to minimize administrative costs at the Federal level and to maximize local control over decisions that must be made with regard to school improvements. 
States and districts will be required to submit applications to the Secretary of Education describing their needs and the process that will be used to award the Federal funds. Once these applications are approved, grantees will immediately receive the full share of the $5 billion. 
In addition, other than following certain criteria, States and local districts will be free to finance their top-priority projects. The Federal Government will not be in the business of dictating priorities and needs to State and local school districts who know their schools best. 
This bill helps address a need that has completely overwhelmed States and local school districts. The magnitude of the school facilities problem is so great today that many districts cannot maintain the kind of educational environment necessary to teach all of our children the kind of skills they will need to compete in the 21st century, global economy.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. I would also like to call to my colleagues' attention the reports and the work done by the General Accounting Office recently, both with regard to the condition of America's schools, State efforts to address the issue of crumbling schools, and the most recent GAO report on school finance generally. These reports speak to the ability or the efforts taken by State and local governments to address the disparities between wealthy and poor and middle-class school districts. 
The fact of the matter is that this disparity, this gap in school funding, does not serve our national interest, does not serve the interest of taxpayers, and does not serve the interest of our children. 
I believe we have an obligation to put aside the old debates of whether or not school funding should happen here or happen there, and we should look at developing a partnership in which everybody plays a part, in which all levels of government collaborate, in which communities, parents, property taxpayers, and income taxpayers cooperate to prepare our people for the 21st century and the challenges they face.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, later today, a number of the friends of Herman C. Gilbert will come together to remember a man whose life embodied the core values we hold so dear. While many people will attend tonight's service at Cosmopolitan Community Church in Chicago, however, they will be only a very small fraction of those whose lives he touched, and those whose lives he made better. 
Herman Gilbert was a leader; he was a doer; he made things happen. All of his life, he worked to make his community a better place in which to live. All of his life he worked to open the doors of opportunity. All of his life he strove to turn what Dr. Martin Luther King called the American `Declaration of Intent' into the reality of life for every American. 
Herman Gilbert led in many fields. He was a publisher; he cofounded Path Press to publish books by and about African-Americans. He was a political leader; he was one of the cofounders of the Chicago League of Negro Voters in 1959, and he served as chief of staff to Congressman Gus Savage for 2 years. He was a civil rights leader, working closely with Dr. King and Mayor Harold Washington of Chicago to fulfill the promise of America for minority Americans. He was a labor leader, active in the United Packinghouse Workers, a progressive union. 
Herman Gilbert was a strong man, with strong views. He brought determination, intelligence, good judgment, and perhaps most importantly, a real commitment to principle and to fundamental values, in everything he did. He knew that nothing worth having comes easily, that real achievement is built on hard work--and he worked hard all of his life for his family, for his community, for African-Americans as a people, and for his country. 
I know he will be greatly missed by his wife, Ivy, by his sister, Addie Lawrence, by his son, Vincent, by his daughter, Dorothea, by his stepdaughter, Lynnette Tate, and by his grandchildren. He will also be missed by the people of Mariana, AR, where he was born, by the people of Cairo, IL, where his family moved in 1937, by the people of the city of Chicago, where he spent most of his life, and by people all across this country who have so benefited from his lifetime of effort on their behalf, and on behalf of us all. 
I will greatly miss him, Mr. President. His was a life that made a difference for many, many people; his was a life that made an important difference for me. Like the others whose lives he touched, I have greatly benefited from the legacy embodied in the life and work of Herman C. Gilbert.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize the achievements of the Women's Business Development Center [WBDC]. Today, they are celebrating their 10th anniversary, and I truly wish I were able to join their celebration in person. 
Currently, there are over 8 million women-owned businesses in the United States, generating $2.3 trillion in sales. In my home state of Illinois alone, there are over 350,000 women business owners. Women business owners across the country employ one of every four U.S. company workers, and women in business are contributing to economic growth both at home and abroad. The story of women in business is one of unqualified success, and that success is thanks in no small part to organizations like the Women's Business Development Center. 
For the past decade, the WBDC has dedicated itself to providing services and programs that support and accelerate women's business ownership and strengthen the impact of women on the economy. Founded in 1986 by Carol Dougal and Hedy Ratner, the WBDC is currently active in six States--Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Florida, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, and has served over 30,000 women business owners. The highly successful programs and services of the WBDC are many in number, including counseling, workshops, entrepreneurial training, the women's business finance programs, the women's business enterprise initiative, the entrepreneurial women's conference and women's business and buyer's mart. 
I wish to commend the WBDC for their vital role in the growing economic impact of women business owners on our Nation's economy. I am proud that the WBDC was founded in Illinois, and that the effects of their good works are felt far beyond the borders of my State.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today's Chicago Sun-Times contained an editorial headlined, `Loosen reins on CBOT, Merc.' The editorial, talking about the Chicago Board of Trade, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, made the point that: 
`Congress must loosen the regulatory reins on the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Otherwise, officials argue convincingly, Chicago will lose business and jobs to the unregulated over the counter markets or overseas exchanges.' 
The Sun-Times had it exactly right. As in so many other areas of financial policy, the law has not kept up with economic reality. The world has changed. There is a revolution underway in finance, and, if the United States sits back and ignores the new realities of the marketplace, the result will be to seriously damage American financial marketplaces vis-a-vis their global competition, and to increasingly warp and distort the competition between and among various American financial markets. 
We must respond; we must respond vigorously; and we must respond now. Chicago's future and option exchanges are an American treasure; their innovations literally created this industry and are in no small part responsible for American leadership in finance. And the creativity of the Chicago exchanges has had a huge payoff for the Chicago area. As the Sun-Times editorial pointed out: 
`The stakes are high. For example, the exchanges calculate that have created 151,000 jobs in the Chicago area.' 
It is imperative, therefore, that we act quickly to reform the Commodity Futures Trading Act as quickly as possible, and that we do so in a way that enhances the ability of the American futures and options industry to meet both their less regulated competition here in the United States, and their evermore formidable competition abroad. I intend to work for quick enactment of the legislation put forward by the distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar. I urge my colleagues to join me, and to ensure that a procompetitive, commonsense approach that allows the futures exchanges to meet and compete with all comers passes this body before the snow melts in Illinois.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, today, the issue before the Senate is whether or not to approve the release of desperately needed international family planning funds 5 months after the start of the fiscal year or 9 months after the start of the fiscal year. This is not a tough decision, we should have released the money months ago; our failure to release the family planning funds has caused unnecessary harm to women, children, and families around the globe. However, since we do not have the ability to go back in time and release the funds at the beginning of the fiscal year, I urge my colleagues to prevent future harm and to support the President's request and release the family planning funds on March 1. 
In this increasingly global economy, it is in the United States' best interest to provide international family planning assistance to developing countries around the world. As the Rockefeller Foundation reports, `* * * resource scarcities, often exacerbated by population growth, undermine the quality of life, confidence in government, and threaten to destabilize many parts of the globe * * *. Thus in a world made smaller by global commerce and communication, such scarcities affect us in the United States. Civil unrest can alter the balance of power in key regions, destabilize nations with large populations and extensive resources, or contribute to humanitarian disasters that call for assistance and peacekeeping services.' The rate of population growth is often inversely related to the rate of economic growth. 
In addition, developing countries provide a significant expanding market for U.S. goods. Unrest and instability can lead to a decrease in exports and thus a decrease in the number jobs here at home. The lack of jobs in a developing country, resulting from the ever expanding work force, can also drive down wages and lead to job loss in this country by forcing U.S. workers to compete with low-wage workers overseas. 
Developing nations with increasingly desperate needs for resources have also been known to over use their natural resources to the detriment of the long-term environmental stability of the nation and of the world. 
International family planning funds allow women to choose to have fewer and thus healthier children. In turn, studies show that when families can count on healthier children, they are likely to have fewer children. This limits population growth around the globe. 
Clearly, there are many other reasons to support international family planning, including the documented decrease in abortions that results from access to family planning assistance and the decrease in infant and maternal mortality. The people of the United States have been outspoken in their support for programs that improve the health and safety of women and their babies and that provide alternatives to abortion as a method of family planning. 
Despite the great importance of family planning, not only for individuals and families, but also for the economic well being of many nations including the United States, the last Congress sustained a 35-percent cut in international family planning funds, a cut that was first enacted in fiscal year 1996. This cut was enacted despite the fact that there are still 230 million women worldwide, one out of every six women of childbearing age, that do not have sufficient access to modern contraceptive methods and despite the fact that we will soon have the largest population of women of child bearing age ever. 
A study conducted by family planning and population organizations in early 1996 predicted that the 35-percent cut in funding would result in an estimated additional 1.9 million births, 1.6 million abortions, 8,000 maternal deaths in pregnancy and 134,000 infant deaths. 
This study did not even consider the effect of the delay in the release of funding that was part of both the fiscal year 1996 and fiscal year 1997 budgets. The fiscal year 1997 budget prevents funds from being released until 9 months into the fiscal year, and even then only a percentage of the funds can be released every month. 
An additional 4 month delay in the release of funds would result in a further reduction in international family planning funds in fiscal year 1997 of $123 million, or one-third of the money appropriated. In addition, because the agencies and organizations can only receive the funds in small increments, there is no economy of scale in the purchase of contraceptives, and there is no consistency in the ability to provide needed services. 
As part of the agreement that allows these funds to be released at all, there is a provision that allows the President to determine that the funding limitations are having `a negative impact on the proper functioning' of the international family planning program and request early release of the funds. The Congress is required to vote by the end of February on whether or not to release the funds in March. Supporting the early release of funds cannot undo the damage caused by the current delay or by the significant cuts already incurred. It can, however, ensure that 17 bilateral and international organizations are not left in urgent need of funds, that women have access to safe, effective contraceptives in the next few months, and that unintended, unsafe pregnancies are prevented. 
The United States has a 30-year commitment to working with organizations and governments around the world to provide women and their families with the ability to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children, improving maternal and infant health, and improving the security and independence of women's lives. 
Some in Congress question the success of these efforts. The U.S. commitment, however, has been a success by every measure. In countries in which the United States has joined in family planning efforts, the average number of children a woman bears has decreased from six to three. The number of women utilizing modern contraceptives has grown from 10 to 50 percent. The U.S. provides people around the world with the opportunity to plan for the safest births and the healthiest children possible. 
Unfortunately, international family planning has become tangled up in the debate over the ability of a woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy. There are those who believe that fully funding the international family planning program would lead to increased abortions. In fact, no U.S. international family planning funds are used for abortion or abortion related services. It is already against the law and that law is rigorously enforced. In addition, if women are not able to access safe, modern contraceptives, there will certainly be an increase in abortion, along with maternal and infant deaths. 
Part of the appeal of linking international family planning and abortion is that many in the United States are concerned with the amount that we spend overseas and do not want funds to pay for activities that are not funded in the United States, like abortions, or to fund programs that coerce women into not having children. No international family planning money is spent on abortions or related services, or on programs that coerce women into making certain family planning decisions. In addition, just about 1 percent of our entire budget is spent on foreign aid of any sort, and only a fraction of that funding is spent on humanitarian aid, such as family planning. 
Last year, Congress agreed to provide family planning funds to communities around the world because the need is there and support for the program exists. Congress should not prevent the funds from being spent by delaying the release for months beyond the start of the fiscal year. 
By voting for the immediate release of funds, we will be voting against maternal and infant ill health and death, and against increased abortions worldwide. We will be voting to strengthen the global economy and preserve our environment. We will keep faith with our duty to provide constructive leadership in the world. I urge my colleagues to vote to release the funds now so that women and children around the globe can be safe and healthy.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the Bureau County Republican on its 150th anniversary. 
Since 1847, the people of Princeton and Bureau County have turned to the Republican for accurate news and information. What began as a small, weekly paper dedicated to the abolition of slavery is now known as the primary local morning newspaper in the region. 
The Bureau County Republican is a great American success story, and Illinois is proud of its long and distinguished history. 
In honor of the paper's sesquicentennial, I ask that an article from the January 2, 1997, edition of the Bureau County Republican be printed at this point in the Record.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I introduce the Comprehensive Women's Pension Protection Act of 1997. At the end of the 104th Congress, Congresswoman Kennelly and I introduced the Comprehensive Women's Pension Protection Act of 1996. When we introduced that legislation at the end of the last Congress we made a commitment to reintroduce this legislation at the beginning of the 105th Congress and to make women's retirement security a priority in the 105th Congress. Today we are keeping that promise. 
The Comprehensive Women's Pension Protection Act of 1997 combines some of the best ideas on women's pension legislation that have come before the House or the Senate and new proposals to increase the security, equity, and accessibility of our pension system. 
Many of America's women are facing a retirement without economic security. The majority of the elderly in this country are, and will continue to be, women, and our retirement system is failing them. 
Younger women are not earning sufficient pension benefits to provide for their secure retirement. Due to the demands of child rearing and elder care, which often take women out of the workforce for a time, and to lower life-time earnings due to continuing wage inequities, the average 35-year-old woman with a $50,000 salary must have accumulated retirement savings of $35,000 in order to have a comfortable retirement. A man need only have saved $3,000 by the time he is 35. 
Many older women worked in the home or took time off to raise families, and when pension benefits of their own. For many older women too, widowhood or divorce can rob them of their part of their husband's pension benefits. To ensure that the golden years are not the disposable years women need to take charge of their own retirement, but Congress must ensure that the Nation's retirement system enables them to do so. 
On May 14, of last year I introduced, and many of my colleagues cosponsored, the Women's Pension Equity Act of 1996, to begin to address one of the leading causes of poverty for the elderly--little or no pension benefits. Less than a third of all female retirees have pensions, and the majority of those that do earn less than $5,000 a year. The lack of pension benefits for many women means the difference between a comfortable retirment and a difficult one. Three of the six provisions of that bill are now law. 
This legislation is a continuation of my effort to enact real pension reforms that will allow women to achieve a secure retirement. Since introducing the first of my women's pension equity bills, I have heard from hundreds of women from States across the country about the need for pension policy that allows women to retire with dignity. 
Addressing pension issues is an integral part of the solution to women's economic insecurity. In addition, pension issues are critical to our Nation as a whole. In light of the demographic trends facing America, retirement security is increasingly important to the quality of life of all of our citizens. Social Security is the focus of much discussion and debate in Congress and throughout the Nation, and it should be. However, addressing the problems facing Social Security alone will not provide women, or any American, with the tools to create a secure retirement. The intent, from its inception, was that Social Security would provide a floor--a minimum amount of resources for retirement. The average retiree will only have about 40 percent of his or her wages replaced by Social Security. 
Clearly, women must take charge of their own retirement and not just rely on Social Security. I have advocated that every woman create her own `pension eight' checklist to prepare for economic security. The 8 items that should be on any woman's checklist include: (1) finding out if she is earning or has ever earned a pension; (2) learning if her employer has a pension plan, and how to be eligible for the plan; (3) contributing to a pension plan if she has the chance; (4) not spending pension earnings if given a one-time payment when leaving a job: (5) if married, finding out if her husband has a pension; (6) not signing away a future right to her husband's pension if he dies; (7) during a divorce, considering the pension as a valuable, jointly earned asset to be divided; and (8) finding out about pension rights and fighting for them. 
Even when women take charge of their own retirement, however, they can face a brick wall of pension law that prevents them from investing enough for their future. Pension laws were not written to reflect the patterns of women's work or women's lives. Women are more likely to move in and out of the workforce, work at home, earn less for the work they do, and work in low paying industries. These factors limit our ability to access or accrue pension benefits. Women are also more likely to be widowed or divorced, live alone, and live longer in their retirement years, leaving them without adequate coverage. 
This bill, which is also being introduced in the House of Representatives today by Congresswoman Kennelly, a long-time champion of women's pension rights, addresses the range of concerns that women face as they consider retirement. 
This legislation preserves women's pensions by ending the practice of integration by the year 2004, the practice whereby pension benefits are reduced by a portion of Social Security benefits. It provides for the automatic division of pensions upon divorce if the divorce decree is silent on pension benefits. It allows a widow or divorced widow to collect her husband's civil service pension if he leaves his job and dies before collecting benefits. And it continue the payment of court ordered Tier II railroad retirement benefits to a divorced widow. 
This legislation protects women's pensions by prohibiting 401(k) plans, the fastest growing type of plans in the country, from investing employee contributions in the company's own stock. It requires annual benefits statements for plan participants. And it applies spousal consent rules governing pension fund withdrawals to 401(k) plans. 
This legislation helps prepare women for retirement by creating a women's pension hotline, providing a real opportunity for women to get answers to their questions. 
By preserving and protecting women's pensions, we in Congress can provide women with the tools they need to prepare for their own retirement. By reintroducing this legislation today we are giving notice that pension policy will be at the top of the agenda for the 105th Congress. 
Pension policy decisions will determine, in no small part, the kind of life Americans will live in their older years. With a baby boomer turning 50 every 9 seconds, we cannot ignore the problems facing people as they grow older. Now, more than ever, all Americans need to consider the role that pensions play in determining the kind of life every American will lead. We look forward to being joined, on a bipartisan basis, by all of our colleagues in the fight for pension equity.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, tomorrow evening, Howard University will be honoring and celebrating one of our Nation's most treasured poets, Gwendolyn Brooks. There, they will highlight her lifetime of accomplishment: Many awards, over 70 honorary degrees, and her status both as the first black Pulitzer Prize winner and Poet Laureate of Illinois. I would like to take a moment to add a few words of my own to the many that will be saluting her tomorrow. 
Like myself, Miss Brooks grew up on the south side of Chicago and attended Chicago public schools. Her parents loved literature and nurtured her early talent. She published her first poem when she was 11, and the world of poetry was forever changed. Her work gave voice to an entire class of people who had not yet been heard, and who had so much to say. 
Her poetry has a soul of its own, sometimes whimsical, sometimes mournful, but always full of truth, and beauty. She writes of love and life and loss and liberty and lunacy and laceration. Her work is often provocative, and always inspirational. One of her most clever poems challenges its readers, shaking them out of complacence, preventing them from passively enjoying her art: 
A poem doesn't do everything for you. 
You are supposed to go on with your thinking. 
You are supposed to enrich the other person's poem with your extensions, 
your uniquely personal understandings, 
thus making the poem serve you. 
However, Gwendolyn Brooks doesn't merely challenge readers, she challenges writers. For more than half a century, she has dedicated herself to nurturing the talent of young writers through her teaching. She sponsors annual poetry contests, using her own money for cash prizes. She is as generous with her time as her money, dispensing advice and answering questions posed by aspiring writers. 
Gwendolyn Brooks is not only one of America's greatest poets and a living legend, but an inspiration to many, myself included. One of the highlights of the day I was sworn in as a Senator 4 years ago was her reading of Aurora to me. Her words from that day live on in me as they do in anyone who has ever heard her speak.

 Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, the Monday, February 10, 1997, Chicago Tribune contained an editorial entitled: `Nurturing Chicago's Exchanges.' The editorial, talking about the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, made the point that: the Chicago exchanges' global market share in future and options plunged from 60 percent in 1987 to 31 percent in 1995. The business is going overseas, where regulatory costs are lower, and off exchanges, where banks and other companies can engineer innovative contracts in a day or two without government approval. 
The Tribune had it exactly right. As in so many other areas of financial policy, the law has not kept up with economic reality. The world has changed. There is a revolution underway in finance, and, if the United States sits back and ignores the new realities of the marketplace, the result will be to seriously damage American financial marketplaces vis-a-vis their global competition, and to increasingly warp and distort the competition between and among various American financial markets. 
We must respond; we must respond vigorously; and we must respond now. Chicago's future and option exchanges are an American treasure; their innovations literally created this industry and are in no small part responsible for American leadership in finance. And the creativity of the Chicago exchanges has had a huge pay off for the Chicago area. As the Tribune editorial pointed out: the commodities and securities businesses have been strong job machines here, accounting for 50,000 direct jobs and total employment of 151,500, up 31 percent from a decade ago. The industry also keeps about $35 billion in Chicago banks. 
It is imperative, therefore, that we act quickly to reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Act as quickly as possible, and that we do so in a way that enhances the ability of the American futures and options industry to meet both their less regulated competition here in the United States, and their evermore formidable competition abroad. I intend to work for quick enactment of the legislation put forward by the distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar. I urge my colleagues to join me, and to ensure that a procompetitive, commonsense approach that allows the futures exchanges to meet and compete with all comers passes this body before the snow melts in Illinois.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today, on the 188th anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, our Nation's 16th and 1st Republican President, to introduce the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery bill. Congressman Jerry Weller, in whose district the newest national veterans cemetery is located, will introduce an identical bill in the House of Representatives today. 
The National Cemetery System was established by President Lincoln in 1862 to provide for the proper burial and registration of graves of soldiers who died in the Civil War. Since its inception, the National Cemetery System has grown to include 130 military burial grounds and provides places of private meditation and reflection for all who visit its hallowed grounds. None of these cemeteries, however, including the six in Illinois, are named after President Lincoln. 
As you know, President Lincoln had great affection for `him who [had] borne the battle'. Perhaps Lincoln's admiration for our Nation's veterans is rooted in the fact that Lincoln--a man of peace--had his Presidency marked by the scourge of war. He knew all too well the sacrifices and hardships that the defenders of our Nation's freedom had to bear and the `cause for which they [may be called to give their] last full measure of devotion.' President Lincoln demonstrated his deep affection for our Nation's veterans in many ways. During the Civil War, he often visited the sick and wounded stationed in and around Washington, DC. His administration created what is now the Department of Veterans Affairs and the VA hospital system. Perhaps the greatest demonstration of his love for our Nation's veterans was his strong leadership and unwavering support for the creation of the National Cemetery System, which not only provides dignified final resting places for our Nation's soldiers but also ensures that neither the Nation nor its citizens will forget those who served in our Armed Forces. 
Last year, Congress approved of the transfer of 982 acres of the former Joliet Army Ammunition Plant from the Department of the Army to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the development of a new national veterans cemetery. The President's budget included $19.9 million for the construction of the first phase of the cemetery, which is scheduled to open in late 1998 or early 1999. 
Mr. President, this legislation to name our Nation's newest national cemetery after President Lincoln deserves strong bipartisan support. By naming the new veterans national cemetery in honor of President Lincoln, we not only acknowledge the pivotal role he played in the development of one of our national treasures--the national veterans cemetery system--we also honor the memory of the millions of courageous men and women who served in war and peacetime to preserve our Nation's democracy, freedom, and national values. Men and women, who like my grandfather, father, and uncle, who fought in World War I and World War II, notwithstanding the fact that the full promise of America was denied them because of the color of their skin. Their patriotism grew out of an abiding respect for American values, and out of the hope for our country. We can do no less in peacetime than to honor not only their sacrifice, but the reasons for it. Naming a national cemetery after President Lincoln is in recognition that that faith and hope abide with us still. 
Illinois is now--and will always be the Land of Lincoln. His legacy is a living testament to the values--honesty, hard work and perseverance in the face of adversity--that characterize residents of America's heartland. No place has a greater claim to the Lincoln heritage than his beloved Springfield, IL, but his memory and what he stood for belong to all of us in the Land of Lincoln and across these United States. As Secretary of War Edward M. Stanton prophetically put it while keeping vigil at Lincoln's deathbed, `Now he belongs to the ages.' 
As such, I can think of no more fitting gift or more appropriate way to celebrate the birthday of our Nation's greatest President, than to support and pass this legislation to name our newest and second-largest national veterans cemetery, in the State he so dearly loved, after him. In Lincoln's immortal words, `it is altogether fitting and proper that we do this.' 
His guidance that a house divided cannot stand is as valid today as it was when given. We leave partisan differences aside when we are called upon to respond to today's challenges as Americans. This legislation is a bipartisan effort to bring all of us together in honor of one of the greatest Americans ever to have lived. As we honor him, and his leadership, we honor the true legacy of his service to our country.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Thank you, Madam President. I rise to speak on the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
Madam President, I am a liberal. I also support a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. To some, this might appear a contradiction in terms. To others, including my predecessor in office, Senator Paul Simon, it is as logically consistent as the classical definition of `liberalism,' and I quote: `Belonging to the people; giving freely; generous; tolerant of views differing from one's own; broad-minded; favoring reform or progress as in education; favoring political reforms tending toward democracy and personal freedom for the individual; progressive.' 
Those are all definitions to be found in Webster's New World Dictionary of a `liberal.' 
It is precisely because I believe in this definition of liberalism that I believe the balanced budget amendment is necessary. Chronic budget deficits and cumulative national debt currently threaten to undermine our ability to act in the public interest. 
Budget deficits make it much harder for our country to focus on what is really important: the objectives we want to achieve. Only by balancing the budget will we be able to reclaim our country's ability to decide to make important investments in our communities, such as fixing crumbling schools, investing in mass transit, providing pension security, ensuring that our airways are safe, or caring for the poor. 
Unless we take a long-term view of budgetary problems and require permanent fiscal prudence, the Federal Government will be forced to spend its resources on paying interest to bondholders, rather than on addressing the priorities of the American people. 
In the name of intergenerational fairness--fairness to these young people who are here as pages and their generation--in the interest of intergenerational fairness, we need to keep in mind the needs of the next generation, not just current short-term issues. 
While we want to be able to respond to the next emergency and to the next one, not telling the truth about the budget and not making the tough choices required forces us to continue to try to finance our future with debt. That accumulation of debt, however, will make America less competitive and less able to respond effectively to future emergencies and future priorities. 
Because of persistent deficits and a huge national debt, the value of what Government is doing is being lost. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, for example, have reduced poverty among the elderly to the lowest levels since statistics first started being kept. Social Security has administrative costs of less than 1 percent of benefits paid, and Medicare has administrative costs of less than 3 percent of benefits paid, both far better in terms of administrative costs than their private counterparts. 
These programs account for almost 50 percent of all noninterest Federal spending, and they have made it possible for literally tens of millions of Americans to enjoy a secure, healthy retirement, and they have helped increase longevity. 
The Federal Government has also built the Interstate Highway System, set aside national parks and created a space program that put men on the Moon, and will soon begin a space station. 
We financed an American military that won the cold war, and we went to the Persian Gulf and achieved victory at the lowest possible cost in American lives. 
In short, Madam President, Government can work. But Government successes are being swallowed up in interest costs that were only 40 years ago about a penny out of every dollar and now today are 15 cents out of every dollar, and growing. Is there any wonder that Americans felt more prosperous in the 1950's and in the 1960's than they do today? 
The balanced budget amendment will not undermine the value of what the Federal Government does. The balanced budget amendment will help clear out that undergrowth of debt, making room for more investment in the values that we hold dear. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Federal Government is right now spending $684 million every day for interest payments on the national debt. That is $684 million that could otherwise be used for Head Start, for housing programs, for our battle against crimes or drugs or to repair our crumbling school infrastructure. And $684 million a day is a resource hemorrhage that we, as a nation, can ill afford. 
In fiscal year 1996, we spent $241 billion to service our national debt. The national debt, as you no doubt have heard, is now $5.2 trillion, and it is growing. We cannot allow these trends to continue unchecked. If we do not act now, if we wait until the country is on the brink of financial ruin, we will have totally failed our obligation to the American people and to our country and our children, and the next generation will pay the price for that failure. 
Madam President, I served on the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform. One of the conclusions that was made clear there was that unless we get the deficit under control, by the year 2003 mandatory spending, which is entitlements plus interest on the national debt, by that year they will account for fully 73 percent of the total Federal budget. These few programs already consume almost two-thirds of Federal resources. So domestic discretionary spending, that is to say, the kinds of things we appropriate here, will be frozen out altogether if we do not get a handle on the continuing deficits. 
Even though, Madam President, the current economic news is generally good and the economy continues to expand, we know that markets go up but then markets also go down again. So the trend, given the changes in our country and the demographic changes, is not likely to continue. 
A recently released Congressional Budget Office report entitled, `The Economic and Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years 1998-2007,' points out:  
Despite the improved outlook through 2007. . .the budget situation will start to deteriorate rapidly only a few years later with the retirement of the first baby boomers and the continued growth of per-person health care costs. 
Madam President, the demographics of our time are something that we have to come to grips with. I like to tell people that this year alone a baby boomer will turn 50 every 9 seconds. So we are aging as a population. That is impacting on our budget situation and the decisions that we here in the Congress have to make. 
By the year 2012 the Social Security trust fund will begin spending more money than it takes in. By the year 2029 the trust fund will have exhausted all its resources. After 2012, when there are no more surpluses, Federal deficits will really begin to explode, an explosion that will be fueled by the looming retirement of the baby-boom generation. 
It is true that for the next 15 years Social Security will be running a surplus. It will be taking in more than it spends. I agree that the existence of these annual surpluses does make the consolidated budget deficit look smaller in the relative short run. But that surplus is a temporary phenomenon. After 2012 Social Security will begin consuming that accumulated surplus. 
Madam President, the temporary or the permanent nature of the surpluses perhaps would not be important if it were actually possible to decouple Social Security completely from the rest of the Federal Government. Social Security, however, is intimately related to the rest of the Government as long as the Social Security system invests in Treasury bonds. 
Right now the Treasury Department is selling U.S. Government bonds to the public, both here and abroad, and to the Social Security system. What that means is that whether Social Security is part of the budget or not, the Treasury Department will be selling exactly the same amount of bonds to the public, including those sold to the trust fund. And it is the amount of bond sales to the public that is the real measure of the Federal deficits in any given year. 
The unbreakable connection of an even theoretically off-budget Social Security system to the rest of the Federal budget will become even more clear by the year 2012 when the Social Security trust fund ceases to take in more money than it pays outs. After that year, Social Security will begin cashing in its Treasury bonds. So whether Social Security is on budget 
our not is irrelevant, frankly, to the fact that the Treasury Department will have to find the cash to pay off those Treasury bonds. 
There are only three basic ways that that can be done: issuing new bonds to the public, thereby increasing the Federal deficits in those years; raising taxes by the amount necessary, which is another option; or cutting spending on other programs by the amounts needed. I hope we never have to get to making those Draconian cuts. I believe that passing the balanced budget amendment will keep us from having to make those choices under that gun. 
Madam President, taking Social Security out of the budget, therefore, does nothing to make our long-term budget problems either better or worse. It does nothing to protect Social Security from the rest of the budget because, again, Treasury bond purchases and sales continue to bind Social Security tightly to the rest of the budget. Perhaps most important, it does nothing to protect the long-term future of Social Security. The only way to protect the long-term future of Social Security and to keep the important Social Security contract with the American people is through reform of that system. 
Madam President, the balanced budget constitutional amendment will not solve these problems overnight. What it will do, however, is force the Congress, the President, and the American people, to face the truth about the budget, all of it, both on the revenue and on the expenditure side of the equation. 
Unless we get the deficit under control, we will be leaving to our children and to our children's children a legacy of debt that will make it impossible for them to achieve the American dream. We owe it to our children and their children to get our fiscal house in order now. If we fail to do so, our legacy to future generations will be one of greater problems and diminished opportunities. 
Madam President, I come from a working-class family. The availability of public education made it possible for me to get advanced degrees. I have no doubt that without the commitment of my parents' generation to create a national community which would nurture my talents, I would not be here today speaking to you as a U.S. Senator. It saddens me that it is harder for a child to get a quality education or for a teenager to pay for college or for a young couple to have a single wage earner outside the home today than it was a generation ago. 
The recent dismantling of our national commitment to support poor children is just the beginning of the chilling effect that these chronic budget deficits will have. We are faced with making hard choices by which this generation will define our national community. That is again why I support this amendment. 
But, Madam President, whether we look to the future or look to the past, the arguments in favor of passage of the balanced budget amendment are compelling. 
As one of our Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson, stated: 
We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves. 
This proposition is as true today as it was when he stated it centuries ago. 
Madam President, our country's debt did not emerge from a national emergency nor from some massive Federal initiative to build roads or educate children or to create jobs for poor people. It came in peacetime and, frankly, largely while no one noticed. When a national consensus against chronic deficits did emerge, it came after the debt had reached historic proportions.  
Madam President, we should have known better. George Washington, in his farewell address warned the Nation:  
As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as possible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but remembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, frequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasion of expense, but by exertions in times of peace, to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burdens which we ourselves ought to bear. 
Again, Madam President, sage advice from the Founding Fathers did not, could not, overcome the pressures of the political and demographic realities of our times. Legislators are often judged by constituents on their ability to--you may not have this expression in your State. But we do in Illinois-- `bring home the bacon' whether in terms of actual pork barrel project specific spending or in terms of across the board program funding. Each and every constituency wants its share. Each has legitimate rationale for its demands. 
However, these constituency demands must be seen in the long term and overarching context of our responsibility to the public interest. The demographic changes the future holds will mean more demand, not less, for health care and retirement security, at precisely the time that changes in technology and the global economy requires more, not less, investment in education, transportation, and infrastructure. The confluences of these trends which government does not control make more important than ever that we make decisions about those things we do control. Passage of the balanced budget amendment will force a discipline in our decisionmaking which may well be the only force great enough to counter the institutional force in favor of secret spending. 
I am not keen about tinkering with the Constitution. Happily, the Founding Fathers envisaged the periodic popularity of constitutional amendments, and required absolute consensus in the process. I hope the balanced budget amendment is one of the few to make it through the Congress and ratification by the States. 
There have been amendments to the Constitution proposed for just about everything in recent years. I hope, however, that this one which had been suggested at the time of the Constitutional Convention, that this one finally makes it through. 
Now, Madam President, critics of the amendment have argued or warned us that a balanced budget amendment could worsen economic recessions or downturns. The amendment, however, contains a safety valve for just this sort of situation. The safety valve would allow Congress to provide for a specific deficit by passing a law with a three-fifths vote in each House; the same vote, I point out, that is required to waive the Budget Act. I believe in the event of an emergency or a recession, Congress would be able, would be anxious to obtain a three-fifths majority to enact a countercyclical package of tax cuts or investment spending to counter the economic downturn. The requirement of the three-fifths majority, however, will ensure that the creation of a specific deficit is done with deliberation and care, and is not a casual occurrence. 
This safety valve also applies to fears about risks of default. Should outlays exceed receipts and if our country were faced with a situation where we were in danger of not being able to pay interest on our debt, Congress could respond with a three-fifths vote to increase the debt. However, this dilemma could be avoided if Congress and the President followed the tenets of the amendment and actually balance the budget, or, better yet, establish a rainy day emergency fund. 
Madam President, an economist friend of mine who I had dinner with argued passionately that we should not be concerned about the debt because after all it is money that we owe ourselves. After all, the interest is paid on Treasury bonds, so reduced to its essentials, it is money that is recirculated in other ways. I do not dispute that point. However, it seems to me that recycling large and growing amounts of taxpayer money to bondholders represents a real problem that we ought to face up to, as well. We are putting off the books and out of Congress' control, scarce resources which are then no longer available for our national priorities. 
My friend also argues, further, that the balanced budget amendment does not allow for capital investment. Again, while most States that have a balanced budget amendment do provide for a separate capital budget, the balanced budget amendment that we are considering here today does not preclude Congress from enacting capital budgeting at the Federal level. 
Another criticism is that should a three-fifths vote be necessary, it would be difficult for Congress to obtain the votes to address emergencies. Again, the need to achieve a three-fifths vote majority is not a foreign concept to this Congress. In the Senate, 60 votes are required to invoke cloture on a bill. Sixty votes are also necessary to waive the enforcement provisions of the Budget Act. In each case, the 60-vote mark is achieved or negotiations and compromise to develop an alternative way of proceeding. 
One might point out now the way we obtain the majority necessary to raise the debt is for both parties to get the votes from their Members. Taking out partisanship is no less necessary under a 60-vote margin. On the important issue of approving more debt, three-fifths is large enough to assure the decision is made with due deliberation but not so large that a minority in either House can deadlock the Government. 
Critics also claim that a balanced budget amendment poses enforcement problems, and I will for a moment address that. For instance, there are fears that disputes would go to the courts. I believe that elevating the balanced budget amendment requirement to constitutional status will, in and of itself, be enough to guarantee that it will be upheld. Every Member of this Congress has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States. The American people expect, as they have every right to, that the officials to whom they entrust the Constitution will not betray that public trust. 
Nor, however, do I believe that the amendment will unduly involve the Federal judiciary in matters of fiscal policy. Senate Joint Resolution 1 provides `the Congress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation * * *' In other words, Congress is directed to enact legislation to make the amendment work. That can include, if necessary, actions to limit the remedies a court could grant in a case brought under the balanced budget amendment. 
In addition, the courts have already developed a number of doctrines which will limit the type and the number of lawsuits which may be brought under the act. First and foremost, all litigants must have standing in order to bring a claim. This generally requires the potential plaintiffs to show they have suffered an injury, in fact, that was caused by the alleged unlawful conduct and which is redressable by the courts. Courts have been extremely reluctant to confer standing to litigants based on their status as taxpayers. Furthermore, courts have a longstanding practice of avoiding controversies that involve a political question. So, I believe, again, that there are adequate safeguards to make certain that the courts do not take 
over the constitutional function of this legislature under a balanced budget amendment. 
Madam President, the opponents of Senate Joint Resolution 1 have a great many arguments to support their view that a balanced budget amendment is unnecessary and unwise. I do not doubt the sincerity of their opposition, for their ranks include a number of Senators with whom I usually find myself in agreement. On balance, however, I believe that the only way we will be able to turn the current budget trends around is to face reality with the help of the balanced budget amendment. We must honestly address the budgetary, fiscal, and social issues of our time without resorting to the pocketbook resources of future generations. 
As I stated at the outset, I am a liberal. My support of the balanced budget amendment is logically consistent with that definition of liberalism that I previously outlined, for several reasons. The balanced budget amendment will save our ability to invest in people. It will protect our capacity for humane government. And the balanced budget will help expand people's opportunities. It is good policy and it is an idea whose time has come. 
Madam President, every generation of Americans has been able to address and resolve challenges unique to their time. That is what makes this country great. Our current fiscal challenges are daunting, but I am convinced that passage of this amendment will preserve our Government's ability to act to face our underlying budget problems--honestly and directly--and save our ability to invest in people. 
Passing a balanced budget amendment will not prevent the Government from acting to help address problems, and working to create expanded opportunities for Americans. It will mean that we will not abandon our responsibility to help educate our children, to assist the poor in moving into the economic mainstream, to protect our environment, or to exercise leadership in any number of areas of important public policy. Balancing the budget may be the critical element in our efforts to preserve the American dream of a better tomorrow. 
I have no doubt but that this generation of Americans is as compassionate and creative and patriotic as previous generations were. We will be forced to make artificially draconian choices if we continue to spend what we do not have, and delude ourselves that debt passed on to future generations is not debt. The balanced budget amendment will force a fiscal discipline which will be the first step toward ensuring our generation will adequately and honestly address its needs so that future generations will at least have the same opportunity. 
Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Utah.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to talk about Beatrice Ruth Fairfax, a constituent of mine who died on January 14, 1997, at the age of 84, after a lifetime of making a difference in the lives of those she touched. She will be sorely missed by her family, friends, and community. 
Upon her graduation from Hyde Park High School, Beatrice Fairfax worked as a writer and became involved in many civil rights and labor union causes. She met her husband, Bob Fairfax through their involvement in cultural arts activities with the Works Progress Administration [WPA]. They married in 1935 and eventually settled in the Altgeld-Murray public housing development as one of Altgeld's first interracial families. The Fairfaxes worked tirelessly to improve the quality of life for public housing residents. They founded and managed the community's first newspaper, the Altgeld Beacon, while working as beat reporters for the Chicago Defender Newspaper. They also established numerous Boy Scout troops throughout the Chicago Housing Authority [CHA], and founded the Jackson Raiders, an award winning drum and bugle corps. In keeping with Mrs. Fairfax's philosophy, `Before a community can make social sense, it has to make economic sense,' the Fairfaxes also participated in the establishment of one of the country's first and largest black owned food co-op stores, which was owned by 300 black families and patronized by thousands of public housing residents. In addition, the Fairfaxes were two of the original plaintiffs in Gautreaux versus Chicago Housing Authority, a landmark case which resulted in the end of racially discriminatory practices of the CHA. 
After her retirement from the Illinois Department of Labor, Mrs. Fairfax continued to be active in community affairs and maintained affiliations with the American Association of Retired Persons, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Boy Scouts of America, Girl Scouts of Chicago, Chicago Parent Teacher Association, Citizen Utility Board, Chicago Urban League, Chicago Sinai Congregation, Jewish Council for the Elderly, Illinois Public Action Council, and the Friends of the Chicago Children's Choir, to name a few. In addition to her many substantial accomplishments, on a personal note, I must say that Bea Fairfax was one of the kindest and most generous people I have known. She didn't just talk the talk, but walked the walk. Her life was truly dedicated to improving the lives of others. No one knows that more than her family, including her daughters, Joyce Theresa Fairfax-Wells, and Ruth Mary Fairfax-Frazier, her son-in-law, Anthany Frazier, her former son-in-law, Cornell Wells her grandchildren, Annika Frazier-Muhammad, Darius Frazier, Monnica Wells, and Jacqueline Wells, her great grandson, Hamza Ibn Omar Frazier-Muhammad, and many other relatives, friends, and members of the community she helped to create. Her death is a great loss, but the legacy of her good works will endure.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to speak on behalf of the nomination of William M. Daley to be the Secretary of Commerce. At the outset, I want to congratulate the President for selecting Bill Daley. I do not believe he could have made a better choice to lead the Department of Commerce into the new century. 
The Department of Commerce has a long and distinguished history, but it is a department that sometimes seems to lack focus. Its mission includes things as diverse forecasting the weather, handling patents and trademarks, conducting the census, travel and tourism, and international trade. What brings all of these diverse subjects together however, is one overriding mission: assisting Americans in enhancing the competitiveness of the United States in the world economy. The Department of Commerce does not control the competitiveness of our economy, but its work opens up competitive opportunities for the private sector, and helps the private sector obtain the information it needs to realize its competitive potential. 
The Department's mission goes beyond the dry names of its subagencies. It is part of the foundation of our economy. It helps open doors abroad for U.S. exporters. It helps us know where we stand, and where we might be going. It gives us the kind of data that helps both American business and American workers achieve a brighter, more prosperous future. It is an advocate for economic growth, and helps build the kind of broader, stronger trade links on which our future economic success in no small part depends. 
Bill Daley has the background, the talent, the integrity, the energy, and the determination to ensure that the Commerce Department reaches its full potential as an asset for U.S. economic growth. He is the ideal person to build on the great work done by Mickey Kantor and the late Ron Brown. 
His past accomplishments demonstrate what he will be able to achieve as Secretary. He is a real leader, both in Illinois and nationally. He has a strong record in the private sector, and an equally strong record in public and civic affairs. His resume is a distinguished one. It includes serving as: 
President and chief operating officer of the Amalgamated Bank of Chicago; 
Special counsel to the President for the North American Free-Trade Agreement in the fall of 1993, helping President Clinton achieve passage of that major trade agreement; 
A senior partner at one of Chicago's most prestigious law firms, Mayer, Brown & Platt; and 
Cochair of Chicago 96, the nonpartisan, not for profit host committee that so successfully oversaw the city and community planning for the 1996 Democratic Convention in Chicago. 
Bill Daley was born and raised in Illinois, and he was also educated in Illinois. His undergraduate degree is from Loyola University in Chicago, and he holds a L.L.B. from the John Marshall Law School in Chicago. 
If I may be permitted a moment of regional chauvinism, I will say that Bill Daley has all the Midwestern virtues. He has an uncommon amount of common sense, he is an extremely hard worker, he is unpretentious, his life exemplifies the kind of family values we talk about so much here in Washington; and he is always focused on getting the job done. He is a skilled lawyer, an extraordinary negotiator, and an executive of rare ability. He has the kind of good judgment that makes him a person who is always being called on for help, and he has never failed to provide that help. And while most of his career has been in the private sector, he has unstintingly given of his time to public and charitable causes. Like his brothers, and his father before him, he has a real commitment to public and community service. Like all of the other members of his family, he is deeply patriotic, and dedicated to doing everything he can to help all of our people and every part of our country build an ever-brighter, ever-more prosperous future. 
Bill Daley has the talent to manage a large, diverse organization like the Department of Commerce, and he is the kind of person that will make the Department run more efficiently and effectively. He understands business, and he knows how important it is for the United States to compete successfully in the world economy. 
This is a time of enormous change, not just in our economy, but also in the Commerce Department. I cannot think of a person better suited to making the necessary reforms so that the Commerce Department can successfully meet the challenges of the new century that will soon be upon us. I know he will make a first-rate Secretary of Commerce, and I strongly recommend that the Senate act expeditiously and favorably on his nomination.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. 
Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure, together with my colleagues, Senators Abraham, D'Amato, Jeffords, Lieberman, Murray, and Daschle to reintroduce the Community Empowerment Act of 1997. This legislation is designed to create new jobs and spur economic growth by encouraging the cleanup and reuse of contaminated industrial and commercial sites known as Brownfields. This bill also creates 20 new additional empowerment zones and 80 new enterprise communities all across the Nation. 
I like to call them environmentally challenged sites. They are sites on which there has been some contamination but not to a level sufficient to reach Superfund status. But they are contaminated nonetheless. They are, on the one hand, excellent locations for industrial and commercial redevelopment because the transportation, more often than not, already exists. The infrastructure, the utilities, and the labor force already exists. 
However, these properties are often unattractive to potential redevelopers because of the known, unknown, or perceived contamination that may exist on the property. This factor creates an incentive for companies to locate and develop in greenfields, which are undeveloped areas generally in the suburbs. This urban flight contributes to urban sprawl, taking jobs away from the city. 
It also results in the paving off of many of the greenfield areas of our country. 
The challenge for all of us is to stop this trend. And one way to do that is by encouraging businesses through the Tax Code to redevelop and to reuse the existing brownfield sites; to reclaim, if you will, sites that have been contaminated which have been used or used up. 
At present, if an industrial property owner does environmental damage to their property and then cleans up the site, the owner is allowed to deduct the cost of that cleanup from a single year's earnings. However, in a strange twist of logic, someone who buys an environmentally damaged piece of property and cleans up that property is not allowed to expense these cleanup costs, but instead must capitalize the cost and depreciate the cleanup expense over many years. 
The result of this? The result has been an urban landscape littered with vacant or abandoned properties, properties that attract crime and bring down property values in surrounding neighborhoods. 
Confronting the brownfields issue can help to address many of the problems that face high unemployment in older communities, including job creation, economic renewal, environmental justice, and environmental improvement. The collective efforts of everyone, particularly the nonprofit community, the private sector, government at all levels, developers, and community groups, are essential to begin the process of returning brownfields property back to productive use and to bring economic growth back to disadvantaged cities and rural areas. 
Under the provisions of this legislation, qualifying brownfields will be provided full first-year expensing of environmental cleanup costs under the Federal Tax Code. Full first-year expensing simply means that a tax deduction will be allowed for the cleanup costs in the year that those costs are incurred. 
The Community Empowerment Act provides tax incentives that we hope will break through some of the current barriers preventing the private sector from investing in brownfields cleanup projects. 
So it provides a carrot, if you will, to the private sector to begin to help not only with the environmental cleanup but also with urban redevelopment. So it becomes a win-win in both regards in that way. 
In my own State of Illinois, the brownfields provisions will have a major impact on efforts to help restore neglected and abandoned industrial areas. It will facilitate the cleanup of some 300 to 500 sites in Illinois, each of which has a remediation cost ranging from $250,000 to $500,000 per site. 
The Treasury Department estimates that this act will provide $2 billion in tax incentives that will leverage an additional $10 billion in private investment, returning an estimated 30,000 brownfields across the country to productive use again. The $2 billion investment will be included in the President's balanced budget plan and so it will be paid for. 
The Federal assistance that this proposal envisions will be concentrated in neighborhoods with the most severe problems and that are truly in need of such investment. The bill targets four areas. 
First, the empowerment zones and enterprise communities across the country. 
Second, areas with a poverty rate of 20 percent or more that are near industrial or former industrial sites. 
Third, existing EPA brownfields pilot areas. The Environmental Protection Agency has already designated brownfields sites across the country. 
Fourth, areas with a population of under 2,000 or more than 75 percent of which is zoned for industrial or commercial use. 
So this is not just a big-city solution. This is something that will affect the cities, the suburbs, and the rural areas as well in providing an incentive to reclaim these environmentally challenged areas of our country. 
In my hometown, in Chicago, Mayor Daley has taken the initiative to establish a brownfields pilot program which has made public investment leverage substantial private investment dollars. One of these projects is known as the Scott Peterson 
Meats Co., in Chicago. The site had been tax delinquent for several years when Scott Peterson Meats and the city began to work together. The city conducted an assessment of potential hazards that were identified and which included asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints, and some 11 underground storage tanks, some of which were filled with tar. The city paid for environmental investigation, cleanup, and building demolition, which totaled some $250,000 in contractor costs. Due to the city's investment, however, the company, Scott Peterson Meats, then turned around and invested an additional $5.2 million in a new smokehouse on its existing property, and it has hired over 100 additional employees to date. So with the win-win of environmental cleanup and urban reclamation we also have job creation coming out of this legislative initiative. 
Another example of a successful public-private partnership pulling people together to clean up a brownfields site is the Madison Equipment site located in Illinois. This abandoned industrial building was a neighborhood eyesore. Scavengers had stolen most of the wiring and plumbing, and illegal or what is called midnight dumping of trash and debris was rampant. Madison Equipment needed expansion space, but it feared the environmental liability. However, in 1993, the city of Chicago took the initiative to invest just a little over $3,000 in this project, in this environmental reclamation, this brownfields project, and 1 year later the company, Madison, put in $180,000 of its own to redevelop the building. The critical reason that lenders and investors look at this area now is because the city committed the public investment to spur private redevelopment and investment. When local government demonstrates the confidence to commit public funds, private financial institutions are more likely to follow suit. These types of examples show how a little investment can go a long way and how we can engage the partnership between the public and the private sector in nonbureaucratic ways in order to spur a result that truly is in the public interest. 
Chicago's pilot project will successfully return all the pilot sites to productive use for a total of about $850,000 in public money. This pilot project is a perfect example of what this legislation can accomplish on a national level. But in order to make it happen, cooperation is the key. Effective strategies require strong partnerships among government, industry, organized labor, community groups, developers, environmentalists, and financiers, who all realize that when their efforts are aligned, when we work together, progress is made easier. 
The second component of this legislation is the establishment of 20 more empowerment zones and 80 additional enterprise communities. They will receive a variety of tools for redevelopment from the Government. 
First, they receive a package of tax incentives and flexible grants available over a 10-year period. 
Second, they receive priority consideration for other Federal empowerment programs. 
Third, they receive assistance in removing bureaucratic redtape and regulatory barriers that prevent innovative uses of the Federal assistance that they have received. 
This approach recognizes that a top-down, big Government solution does not work in these times and what we have to do is enhance public-private partnerships and the involvement and engagement of all sectors in order to bring about again the public policy result that we are all desirous of seeing. 
Economic empowerment can be achieved, but it is best done, I believe, through these public-private partnerships. Economic revitalization in this Nation's most distressed communities is essential to the growth of our entire country. With the concept of team effort, we can rebuild cities by stimulating investments and creating jobs. Environmental protection used in this way can and will be good business. It is also good policy. With this legislation, we will begin the effort to restore economic growth back into our country's industrial centers and rural communities all the while improving our environment. 
Again, I wish to thank my colleagues, Senators Abraham, D'Amato, Jeffords, Lieberman, Murray, and Daschle for their original cosponsorship of this legislation and for making this legislation a truly bipartisan effort. I urge all of my colleagues to join in supporting the quick passage of this legislation.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Assistant Secretary Andrew Cuomo to be the next Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and I look forward to his confirmation by the Senate today. 
As a member of the Banking Committee, I had the pleasure of participating in Mr. Cuomo's confirmation hearing. I continue to be impressed by Mr. Cuomo's commitment to expanding housing opportunities for the people of this Nation and to cutting the bureaucracy which too often hinders such efforts. 
When Congress passed the Public Housing Act of 1937, the findings stated, `It is the policy of the United States to promote the general welfare of the Nation by employing its funds and credit * * * to remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of lower income * * *' In other words, it is in the Nation's best interest to invest in housing for the American people. 
In both word and deed, Andrew Cuomo has demonstrated that he believes in the goals of the 1937 act. From his work founding HELP, the Nation's largest nonprofit provider of transitional housing for the homeless, to his efforts as Assistant Secretary for the Office of Community Planning and Development at HUD, Secretary-designate Cuomo's commitment to expanding housing opportunities for all Americans is clear. 
His work was recognized by former New York City Mayor David Dinkins who named Andrew Cuomo chairman of the New York City Commission on the Homeless. The commission's report, `The Way Home: A New Direction in Social Policy,' suggested a continuum of care policy that was adopted by the mayor and has been recognized nationally as a model for ending homelessness. 
One of the reasons that I am particularly pleased to be supporting this nominee today is that his approach to expanding housing opportunities is multifaceted. When we talk about housing, we are, in reality, talking about community. The home is the building block of the community which in turn is the building block of the Nation. 
In order to build community, it is foolish to ignore the availability of capital, the presence or lack of jobs, the wealth or poverty of the residents, or the ability of people to pay their own way, now or in the future. 
Andrew Cuomo understands that people often need not only a home, but a job to pay for that home. And he understands the fundamental role of public/private partnerships in providing access to both. 
Under his tenure as Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, there has been an increase in the amount of investment available for job creation, business expansion, and capital access for cities, a more effective strategy for reducing homelessness, and the implementation of the important empowerment zone/enterprise community initiatives. 
Any new Secretary of HUD will face enormous challenges, not the least of which will be how to effectively streamline and improve the HUD bureaucracy. Good ideas and sound efforts are often prevented from succeeding because the costs of the bureaucracy are too great. Efficiency and economic savings must go hand-in-hand with vision and hard work. I am confident that Andrew Cuomo is the right person to address this set of problems. 
I look forward to the rapid confirmation of Andrew Cuomo to be the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
I support his confirmation and look forward to working with him to tackle the challenges facing America's communities at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support as an original cosponsor of the Children's Health Coverage Act of 1997--S. 13. Vice President Hubert Humphrey may have summed it up best when he concluded that `the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life--the sick, the needy, and the handicapped.' 
Well, Mr. President, the Children's Health Coverage Act is our test for the 105th Congress and how this Congress will respond to the need to care for our children, who are in the dawn of their life; 10.5 million children have no health insurance coverage. The GAO conclusion that children without insurance are less likely to grow up to be healthy, and productive adults may be the most telling fact. If we know the effect being uninsured has on our children's ability to contribute to society, how can we not respond? 
The ultimate guarantee of our children's health would be to make comprehensive health insurance coverage more readily available either through a private or public source. In the interim however, the Children's Health Coverage Act will make a number of important steps to improve the health of our children. First, enhancing health coverage for pregnant women will make our children healthy on the front-end through enhanced prenatal care. In 1993, almost 200,000 children were born to women who received either no prenatal care or prenatal care after the first trimester of their pregnancy. Good prenatal care can reduce rates of low-weight births and infant mortality, thus preventing avoidable disabilities. 
Next, the Children's Health Coverage Act will not erode existing health coverage for children. Children are losing private health insurance coverage faster than any other group. In many cases, Medicaid has been the safety-net preventing children from becoming uninsured. S. 13 will stimulate the market for private children's health coverage and deter employers from dropping their contributions toward the coverage of their employees. 
Finally, the Children's Health Coverage Act makes the next logical step from the improvements made in the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care bill, by tackling the issue of insurance affordability. The right to buy insurance that you cannot afford really is not access at all. Millions of Americans were given more flexibility by making insurance more portable and ending `job lock.' However, if the ability to pay your premiums severely restricts the options, have we truly ended `job lock.' 
Mr. President, caring for our children is critical to the success and the survival of this nation. However, we must not be content with only meeting the physiological needs of our children. We must also adopt a holistic approach to meeting the needs of our children. A significant number of our children have special health care needs. There are also many children who have special educational, financial, and social needs. 
During the `Stand for Children' rally in June of last year, five core principles were espoused that are essential to safeguarding our children. These principles are to give our children a Head start, a fair start, a safe start, a moral start, and a healthy start. These are fundamental principles that should govern our nation's agenda towards children. The Children's Health Coverage Act is a very good step toward ensuring a healthy start for our children. I hope that my colleagues can join me in supporting this important legislation.

Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the list of cosponsors of the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act of 1997. I think this act is vitally important to prevent health providers from cutting costs at the expense of women's health. 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. This year alone approximately 184,300 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer while another 44,300 women will die of the disease. Breast cancer is a disease that will affect one in every eight women. With statistics like these, it is possible that every family in America will feel the effects of this disease. 
This act would ensure that health insurers which already provide for the treatment of breast cancer cover a minimum hospital stay of 48 hours for patients undergoing mastectomies and 24 hours for those undergoing lymph node removal if she and her doctor choose. I am cosponsoring this bill to ensure that breast cancer surgery is not relegated to routine outpatient surgery. 
The average hospital stay of a breast cancer patient has dwindled from 4-6 to 2-3 days and currently some patients are sent home a few hours after their operation. Both the American College of Surgeons and the American Medical Association believe that most patients require hospital stays that are longer than the current trends. In addition, accepted practice has shown that breast cancer surgery patients require at least 48 hours in the hospital after a mastectomy and 24 hours' hospital stay after a lymph node removal. 
The important aspect of this matter is that women are being sent home after breast cancer surgery before they are neither physically nor emotionally ready to be released from the hospital. The reason for sending these women home has nothing to do with medical standards of care and everything to do with the bottom line. I support the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act because it will allow the decisions on how long to stay in the hospital to be determined by the patient and her doctor. If it is determined that the patient is not in need of a 48-hour stay, the doctor may release the patient from hospital care. The crucial distinction between this scenario and what is currently being practiced is that insurers will not be able to force someone out on a purely arbitrary basis. Decisions will be made based on the needs of the patient rather than the fiscal concerns of the insurer. 
This legislation enjoys the support of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, the National Association of Breast Care Organizations, the Y-me National Breast Cancer Organization, the Families USA foundation, the Women's Legal Defense Fund, and the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. 
I have given careful consideration to the issues involved and believe that this act will ensure that American women receive the health care treatment and coverage that they are entitled to. I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to endorse this effort.
