Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator is correct. The version of H.R. 2204 that first passed the House last year included a section that made a change to the Clean Water Act to clarify liability concerns of the oil spill response industry. The Senate-passed H.R. 2204 on Monday, October 12, 1998, but it did not include the provision. The House amendment that is now before the Senate includes this provision in section 411(b).

Mr. CHAFEE. The intent of this provision is to make it clear that discharges incidental to mechanical removal authorized by the President are not themselves separate and distinct acts of discharge within the meaning of the Clean Water Act. Our purpose is that persons, such as cleanup contractors, whose sole connection to discharges is cleanup or removal, will not be held responsible for unavoidable inconsequential discharges which are a function only of available response technology. For example, mechanical removal activities such as the `decanting' or separation of water from recovered oil usually involve the return of excess water into the response area. Since mechanical removal devices do not operate with 100% efficiency, some oil from the original discharge is entrained with the return water flow to the water body being mechanically cleaned. 
Section 411(b) is not intended to alter the liability of responsible parties in any fashion. It is not intended to enable a responsible party to attribute any portion of the oil originally spilled to a subsequent release incident to the mechanical oil removal process. In other words, this provision is not intended to alter Congress' intent as expressed in section 311(c)(4)(B) of the Clean Water Act. It is limited solely to actions approved by the President in accordance with Clean Water Act section 311(c). In addition, this provision does not alter in any way the penalty calculation set forth in this section.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider the nomination of Margaret E. Curran as U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island. I wholeheartedly support Ms. Curran's nomination and appreciate its speedy consideration by the Judiciary Committee. It certainly is noteworthy that Ms. Curran will be the first woman to serve as U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island in the more than two hundred years that this position has existed. 
Ms. Curran has served as Interim U.S. Attorney since May. She has proven herself to be a thoughtful, competent, and qualified federal prosecutor. I have every confidence that she will continue to do a fine job as the chief federal law enforcement office in Rhode Island. An editorial in the Providence Journal said of Ms. Curran: `She has shown herself to have capacious qualities of leadership, intellectual rigor, and good humor,' qualities that will serve her well as U.S. Attorney. 
Ms. Curran has twelve years of experience as a federal prosecutor. She has earned wide regard from the legal community in Rhode Island. And she enjoys resounding support from Governor Lincoln Almond, who, for twenty years, held the position she will assume. 
Meg Curran is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and received a Master of Science Degree in anthropology from Purdue University. In 1983, she received her Law Degree from the University of Connecticut, where she served as editor-in-chief of the Connecticut Law Review. Before serving in the U.S. Attorney's office, Ms. Curran was clerk to the Honorable Bruce M. Selya, U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island and for the Honorable Thomas J. Meskill, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. She is a member of the Rhode Island Bar Association, serves on the Federal Branch-Bar Committee, as well as the Roger Williams American Inn of Court, the First Circuit Gender Bias Task Force, and the American Law Institute. Also, Ms. Curran is professor of advanced criminal law at Roger Williams University Law School in Rhode Island. 
I am delighted that the Senate is prepared to confirm Margaret Ellen Curran as U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island.

Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, we expect it would. The situation the Senator describes is exactly the type of situation that we would expect could be addressed by EDA. In fact, I would direct the senator's attention to the bill's new Section 2(a)(1), which specifically references areas that are affected by Federal actions. The language notes as possible distressed areas those that suffer dislocation as a result of `certain Federal actions (including environmental requirements that result in the removal of economic activities from a locality).'

Mr. CHAFEE. Section 301(a) sets the basic eligibility requirements for economically distressed areas. These criteria are intended to ensure that EDA assistance is targeted to truly distressed communities. The third criterion, which you mention, is intended to allow the necessary flexibility to address other situations of serious distress that, for a number of reasons, may not fulfill the first two criteria but that clearly would be considered by the Secretary and Congress as deserving of assistance. Thus, the bill before us provides the Secretary with sufficient flexibility in this regard.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1222 the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1998. This bill is the culmination of efforts by Senators Breaux, Faircloth, Sarbanes, Torricelli, and myself to address the serious problems facing our Nation's estuaries. I would like to thank each of my colleagues for their diligent work. I would also like to express my appreciation toward the 26 cosponsors who also support the bill. Such strong bipartisan support is a testament to the extent and severity of the problems facing estuaries, and the need for action to restore estuary habitat. 
I believe that in order to understand the necessity of this bill, one has to realize the immense value of estuaries and estuary habitat. Estuaries are formed by the mixing of salt water from the ocean and fresh water from rivers and streams. Commonly known as bays, lagoons, and sounds, these water bodies and their surrounding wetlands provide some of the most ecologically and economically productive habitat in the world. Many different plants, waterfowl, fish and wildlife make their home in estuaries. In fact, more than half of the neo-tropical migratory birds in the United States and a large number of endangered and threatened species depend upon estuaries for their survival. 
This high productivity also gives estuaries great economic importance. 75 percent of the commercial fish and shellfish catch and 80 to 90 percent of the recreational fish catch are dependent upon estuaries for their survival. The commercial industry contributes $111 billion per year to the national economy. Tourism is another key segment of the economy supported by estuaries. In 1993, 180 million Americans, approximately 70 percent of the U.S. population, visited estuaries to fish, swim, hunt, dive, view wildlife, bike, and learn. In total, approximately 28 million jobs are generated by commercial fishing tourism, and other industries based near estuaries and other coastal waters. 
The wetlands, marshlands, and grasslands that surround estuaries also provide important help and safety benefits. These areas improve water quality by filtering terrestrial pollutants before they can contaminate shellfish beds and coastal waters. Doctor J. Easly, a natural resource economist at North Carolina State University, calculates that one acre of tidal estuary has the pollutant filtering and removal capabilities of a $115,000 waste treatment plant. Flooding is serious problem facing many communities around the nation. Estuary habitat not only cleans the water, but can also store large volumes of water and minimize the damage caused by flooding. Finally, esturine wetlands and barrier islands also serve as buffer zones for coastal areas, reducing erosion and storm damage. 
While these biological, economic, health and safety benefits help to illustrate the immense value of estuary habitat, I still believe they fail to provide a complete picture. Estuaries have a spiritual and symbolic importance, demonstrated by the close connection between neighboring communities and the bays and sounds. The executive director of the Providence Rhode Island Save the Bay Inc., H. Curtis Spalding, captured this feeling when he testified that: 
Narragansett Bay is our home. Even if we live miles from its shores, it is part of what makes Rhode Island special. The bay is our life line, it nourishes our environment, strengthens our economy, enhances our leisure time, and protects our children's future. 
Tragically, this life line is unraveling. Commercial and residential development are resulting in the physical destruction of many estuaries from dredging, draining, bulldozing and paving. Invasive, alien plant species have displaced native plants and overgrown estuary systems. Restricted tidal flow and freshwater diversions interfere with tidal action, impairing the natural cleansing of the bay and harming important fisheries. 
Elevated levels of toxics have also been detected in estuary sediments, water, and animals. Many of these substances undergo `bioaccumulation,' a process by which toxics from the environment become concentrated in the tissue of living animals. Bioaccumulation of toxics into seafood can pose a serious risk to human health. 
Nutrient pollution from a variety of sources disrupts aquatic life by contributing to an overabundance of algae, lox oxygen levels, and massive fish kills. Disease causing microorganisms from animal and human waste 
contaminate productive shellfish beds and recreational beach waters, necessitating shellfish bed and beach closings. 
A recent and ominous development is the transformation of naturally occurring microorganisms from benign to toxic forms. A specific example is Pfiesteria piscicida. Massive fish kills in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina have been traced to the emergence of a new, predatory form of Pfiesteria. This new form actively injects toxins into fish and may have the potential to harm human health. 
The impact of these problems on Narragansett Bay is painfully apparent. Eel grass beds have declined from thousands of acres to roughly 100 acres. Salt marsh acreage has been reduced by half, and all of the remaining marshland needs some level of restoration. Fish runs, the freshwater rivers and streams needed by many fish to reproduce, have been reduced to 15 out of the original 50. In 1996, 36,000 acres of shellfish beds were permanently closed or harvest restricted due to pathogen contamination. These declines in habitat have contributed to the near collapse of many Narragansett Bay fisheries in the past 20 years, and the loss of millions of dollars in revenue. 
The problems facing Narragansett Bay are not unique to Rhode Island. The decline of estuaries is a national tragedy. According to the EPA's National Water Quality Inventory, 38 percent of the surveyed estuarine square miles are impaired for one or more uses. From colonial times to the present, over 55 million acres of coastal wetlands in the continental United States have been destroyed. Recent population growth in coastal areas has resulted in extensive loss of estuary habitat. San Francisco Bay in California has lost 95 percent of its original tidal wetlands, and Galveston Bay in Texas has lost 85 percent of its original sea grass meadows. Almost half of the U.S. population now lives in coastal areas, and the rate of population growth in coastal areas is three times that of noncoastal areas. As America's coastal population increases, so will the pressures placed upon coastal waters and estuaries. 
In response to the grave threats facing our estuaries, the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1998 seeks to both preserve and restore these ecological treasures. The bill sets a national goal to restore one million acres of estuary habitat by the year 2010. In support of this goal, $315 million for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 will be authorized to carry out estuary habitat restoration projects. Given the large scope of our mission, simply handing out money will not solve the problem. We must maximize the environmental benefit obtained from each dollar spent. By emphasizing coordination, cooperation and implementation, the bill ensures that we make the most out of limited Federal resources. 
The key to the efficient use of funds is improved coordination. The bill establishes an interagency Collaborative Council to facilitate coordination between Federal, State, and local programs. The council will be composed of the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Army Corps of Engineers, the Under Secretary of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Fish and Wildlife Service. The Army Corps of Engineers, due to its expertise in engineering and management, will chair the council. 
The council, in consultation with State, tribal, and local governments as well as nongovernmental entities, will develop a national strategy for habitat restoration. One of the primary goals of this strategy will be to prevent overlap between programs and insure the efficient utilization of resources. 
The Collaborative Council will also disperse funds to assist community groups and other non-Federal entities in developing and implementing estuary restoration projects. Applicants will be required to obtain approval of State or local agencies, where such approval is appropriate, to prevent conflict with local and regional management strategies. The Collaborative Council will select estuary habitat restoration projects to receive Federal funding. The criteria used to select projects will encourage and emphasize several factors. Priority will be given to the projects implementing approved Federal estuary management restoration plans, and projects with monitoring plans to ensure that restoration goals are achieved and sources of pollution that would otherwise re-impair the restored habitat are addressed. The Council will also consider the quantity and quality of habitat restored in relation to the economic cost of the project. 
In order to maximize the benefit of limited Federal resources, and 
 encourage partnerships between Federal and non-Federal entities, the act will establish a Federal cost-sharing requirement. The Federal portion of a restoration project will not exceed 65 percent of the total costs, and priority will be given to applications that minimize the Federal contribution to the project. The cost-sharing provision of the act will preserve the essential role of the Federal Government in supporting estuary restoration, while highlighting the importance of regional and local involvement. Successful restoration efforts depend upon cooperation between public and private sectors. By distributing the costs of conservation and restoration, the act will reaffirm the importance of States, tribes, local communities, and concerned parties in preserving their natural heritage and resources. 
Monitoring and evaluation is a key provision of the bill. The Under Secretary of Oceans and Atmosphere will maintain a data base of restoration projects to ensure that available information will be continually incorporated into habitat restoration projects. In addition to maintaining a database, the Council will publish a report to Congress detailing the progress made under the act. This report will allow for an assessment of the successes and failures of current management strategies, with the goal of continually improving restoration efforts. 
This legislation will also amend the National Estuary Program provision of the Clean Water Act to emphasize implementation and action as well as planning. The National Estuary Program was established by the 1988 amendments to the Clean Water Act. The program is an important partnership among Federal, State, and local governments to protect estuaries of national significance threatened by pollution. Under the program, governors work with the EPA to designate areas as a National Estuaries. Federal money is then provided to State and local governments to develop comprehensive conservation and management plans. To date, 28 conservation plans have been prepared for designated estuaries. While this program has achieved remarkable results, the law currently restricts EPA to only funding the development of plans, not their implementation. This bill will amend the National Estuary Program to allow the EPA to support both the development and implementation of conservation plans, and will authorize $25 million for each of fiscal years 1999 and 2000. It is important to note that while the Federal Government will increase its support for this valuable program, the primary responsibility for the implementation of conservation plans will rest with State and local governments. 
Key provisions of the bill will also continue and expand existing programs. The Chesapeake Bay Program has become a model for other estuary restoration and protection programs around the world. EPA`s Chesapeake Bay Program office will continue its leadership and technology transfer to other groups participating in the National Estuary Program. The Chesapeake Bay Program commits States in the bay and the Federal Government to reducing the level of nutrients in the bay and addressing other key issues in natural resources, water quality, population growth, and public access. The bill will authorize $30 million for each of fiscal years 1999 through 2003 to help achieve these goals. The money will be distributed as implementation grants to signatory jurisdictions, and as technical assistance grants to nonprofit private organizations and individuals, State, and local governments, and interstate agencies. Signatory jurisdictions will also be required to update, expand, and begin implementing their tributary specific management strategies. EPA will also be provided with new authority to ensure that Federal facilities in the watershed participate in the Chesapeake Bay Program and contribute to local efforts to restore and protect the bay. 
Another positive change in the program will be the addition of the Chesapeake Bay gateways and watertrails network. The network will consist of important natural, cultural, historical and recreational resources linked together in a manner that enhances public education and access to the bay. The act will authorize $3 million for each of fiscal years 1999 through 2003 in matching grants for bay conservation and restoration. The Department of the Interior, in cooperation with the EPA, will identify ecologically or culturally significant areas of the bay and designate these resources as Chesapeake Bay gateway sites. These agencies will then work in partnership with State and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and other interested parties, to conserve and restore these sites. 
The act also will continue to support is the effort to restore the Long Island Sound. A comprehensive conservation and management plan has already been developed for this important ecological resource. Over the next 15 years, the Long Island sound conservation plan calls for a reduction in the amount of nutrients reaching the sound by 60 percent. The plan also sets a goal of restoring 2,000 acres of coastal habitat and 100 miles of river used by migratory fishes. In support of these important efforts, the act will authorize $10 million for each of fiscal years 1999 through 2003 to implement this plan. 
Finally, this bill will address the threat that pfiesteria piscicida poses to the Nation's waterways. The first toxic outbreak occurred in North Carolina in the late 1980's. In recent years, toxic outbreaks have occurred in tributaries leading into the Chesapeake Bay. The act will authorize $5 million for each of fiscal years 1999 and 2000 to establish an interagency research program for the eradication or control of pfiesteria and other aquatic toxins. 
When evaluating this bill, I believe it is important to focus on what the bill does, and does not, do. The bill does not impose mandates. The bill does not create more regulations. And the bill does not require the Federal Government to foot the entire bill for estuary restoration. What the bill does is provide incentives for States, tribes, local governments, and other interested parties to enter into partnerships with the Federal Government for environmental preservation. This bill builds upon years of planning and focuses on action and implementation at the local level, by encouraging communities and individuals to become involved in estuary restoration. In short, the bill is a simple and direct approach to preserving and restoring some of our Nation's most valuable natural resources. By passing this legislation, we are making a responsible investment in our Nation's natural and economic future. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the managers of the 1998 Coast Guard Authorization Act for their help in addressing an issue of great importance in Rhode Island: the safety of the tug and barge industry. The managers' amendment to the Coast Guard Authorization Act that passed the Senate on Monday included a provision that will strengthen the regulation of transportation of petroleum by barges in the waters of the Northeast. 
I appreciate the cooperation of Commerce Committee Chairman McCain, Ranking Member Hollings, Subcommittee Chairwoman Snowe, and Ranking Member Kerry for incorporating my provision into the bill. 
I especially want to thank the cosponsor of the provision, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, for his support. We have worked closely on this issue for several years. Senator Dodd of Connecticut also lent his support to the effort. 
In order to understand why the Chaffee-Lieberman provisions are necessary, you must go back to the 1996 disaster when the tug Scandia and barge North Cape grounded on the coast of Rhode Island. After the accident, the Environment and Public Works Committee, which I chair, reported a bill to improve towing vessel safety, and important elements of the bill were included in the 1996 Coast Guard Authorization Act. My intent in enacting 1996 provisions was to improve safety in the towing industry so as to prevent a repetition of a disaster like the 1996 Scandia/North Cape spill in Block Island Sound. 
In October, 1997 the Coast Guard issued rules to implement the 1996 towing vessel legislation. I and others concluded that the proposed rules might not prevent a repetition of the Scandia/North Cape disaster and asked the Coast Guard to reconsider. The Coast Guard is now reworking the rules and expect to issue an interim final national rule on anchoring and barge retrieval systems in November 1998. They will repropose fire suppression regulations in January 1999. 
Senator Lieberman and I also were concerned that the proposed rules did not implement the recommendations of the Regional Risk Assessment Team or `RRAT,' which forged a remarkable consensus among Coast Guard District One, the States, the environmental community, and the regulated industry on rules, to improve safety and reduce risks in the waters of the Northeast States. 
The team was assembled by the Marine Safety Office in the First Coast Guard District shortly after the North Cape spill. The RRAT met for six months and, in February 1997, delivered a report with extensive regulatory recommendations. Regulations were proposed in the following areas: vessel manning, anchors and barge retrieval systems, voyage planning, navigation safety equipment aboard towing vessels, enhanced communications, vessel traffic schemes and exclusion zones, lightering activities, tug escorts, and crew fatigue. 
The report was signed by the RRAT Steering Committee members: the Chief of the Marine Safety Division of the First Coast Guard District, the American Waterway Operators (on behalf of the regulated industry), Save the Bay (on behalf of environmental organizations), and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (on behalf of states participating in the RRAT). 
The Coast Guard was deeply involved in the RRAT process. The First Coast Guard District facilitated RRAT meetings, prepared the agendas and minutes, and lent other administrative support to the effort. In June 1997, the First Coast Guard District also forwarded its plan to implement the RRAT recommendations to Coast Guard Headquarters. 
It was the expectation of the state, environmental, and industry RRAT participants that the RRAT recommendations for regional regulations would be included as a part of the rulemaking to implement the towing vessel safety provisions in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996. This was a reasonable expectation based upon the level of Coast Guard involvement in the development of the consensus RRAT recommendations, which were then endorsed by the Coast Guard Officer charged with marine safety in the RRAT study area. 
Unfortunately, the regulations proposed by the Coast Guard in October 1997, did not incorporate the RRAT's recommendations for regional regulations. It also rejected specific RRAT recommendations on anchor and emergency retrieval provisions. Subsequent inquiry by Senator Lieberman and myself revealed that the Coast Guard did not have any future plan to issue the RRAT's recommended regulations. 
This decision by the Coast Guard was simply not acceptable. In April 1998, Senator Lieberman and I asked that the Coast Guard immediately issue the regional regulations. This same request was made by many others in New England, including States environmental departments, regional and local environmental organizations, and private citizens in written comments, and at an April 9, 1998, hearing in Newport, Rhode Island. 
To its great credit, the Coast Guard has reevaluated its initial rejection of regional regulations. The Coast Guard has embraced the RRAT recommendations, and has 
been making admirable progress of implementing the RRAT report. I am pleased to report that the Coast Guard will publish a proposed regional regulation in the Federal Register today. Because of its proactive reponse to the concerns that Senator Lieberman and I raised, the Coast Guard is in position to meet the aggressive deadlines in the Chafee-Lieberman provision in this year's Coast Guard bill. 
The Chafee-Lieberman provision, section 311 of the managers' amendment to H.R. 2204, directs the Coast Guard to issue regulations for towing and barge safety for the waters of the Northeast, including Long Island Sound. Section 311 directs the Coast Guard to give full consideration to each of the regulatory recommendations made by the RRAT and explain in detail if any recommendation is not adopted. 
Section 311 directly addresses anchoring and barge retrieval systems on a regional basis only. It is my understanding the Coast Guard is planning to issue a nationwide national interim final regulation on the anchor requirement by the end of November 1998. The amendment gives the Coast Guard the discretion to forego a regional requirement if the national requirement for anchoring and barge retrieval are no less stringent than those required for the waters of the Northeast. 
Though not a part of the Chafee-Lieberman provision adopted in H.R. 2204, I wish to address the issue of fire suppression systems on tugboats. The fire on board the Scandia was the critical link in the chain of events that led to the grounding of the barge North Cape and the resultant oil spill. It is my view that the October 1997 proposed rules badly missed the mark on this issue. The Coast Guard proposal did not require a fire suppression system that would flood the engine room with a gas to extinguish a serious fire. This is a fatal defect in the proposed rule, and is inconsistent with the 1996 Coast Guard Authorization Act. 
The Coast Guard's October 1997 proposal inferred a mandate `to prevent casualties involving barges which are the result of a loss of propulsion of the towing vessel.' The 1996 Coast Guard Authorization Act's actual mandate is quite explicit: `The Secretary shall require * * * the use of a fire suppression system or other measures to provide adequate assurance that fires on board towing vessels can be suppressed under reasonably foreseeable circumstances.' This is a clear mandate that onboard equipment be able to suppress reasonably foreseeable fires such as occurred on the Scandia. 
The 1996 statute reflects Congress' judgment that the preferred alternative is to suppress a fire quickly enough so that damage is limited and propulsive power can be restored if interrupted due to fire fighting efforts. A fixed fire suppression system is an option that any vessel master would desire if faced with an engine room fire that could not be controlled by other means. 
The proposed regulations used vessel size as a principal criterion, while failing to consider adequately any differential requirements based on the `characteristics, methods of operation, and nature of service' as required by the law, which intentionally omitted size from the list of factors to consider. 
Not all towing vessels are the same when considering the imposition of a requirement for a fixed flooding fire suppression system. Specifically, tugboats like the Scandia which tow barges on the East Coast of the United States, are essentially seagoing vessels with sealable watertight doors and port holes. Tow boats operating on rivers and inland waterways are not designed for the same type of service. On these inland vessels, engine rooms may be located on the main deck, and they may have conventional doors and windows. 
The proposed Coast Guard rule correctly noted that, looking at towing vessels as a whole, certain types of vessels are `constructed with engine rooms that would not be sufficiently air tight' to be able to use a system that floods the space with a gas to extinguish an out-of-control blaze. This is certainly true in the case of inland tow boats. 
Tug boats designed for ocean service such as the Scandia, if they are operated in a prudent and seamanlike manner, do have the requisite water and air tightness to use a fixed flooding fire suppression system to good advantage. Congress specifically required that the proposed regulations account for the variations within the commercial towing fleet. 
My preference was to simply mandate a fire suppression system for ocean-going tugboats in this year's Coast Guard bill. After hearing the concerns raised by the Coast Guard and colleagues on the Commerce Committee, I will not pursue fire suppression changes this year. I look forward to the Coast Guard's new proposal on fire suppression, which is due for publication in January 1999. I expect it will be a marked improvement over the flawed October 1997 proposal. 
In closing, I again thank my colleagues on the Commerce Committee for accommodating my concerns on this issue. I also want to thank the Coast Guard. They could have waited until section 311 became law before starting on the regional regulations. Instead, the Coast Guard, by proposing the regional regulations this very day, has accelerated the date when the Northeast will have the protection it deserves. Finally, I thank my long-time collaborator on oil spill issues, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, for his steadfast support in this effort.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that this package of fish and wildlife bills is being considered by the Senate today. It is a package that combines some very popular bills with some wonderful conservation initiatives approved by the Committee on Environment and Public Works. It represents an effort on the part of both the Senate and the House to quickly move these bills in the waning days of the 105th Congress. I would like to enumerate the components of this package. 
The first item is H.R. 2863, a bill that amends the Migratory Bird Treaty Act with respect to offenses relating to the baiting of migratory birds. This bill was reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee on Friday, October 2. 
I am including an amendment that makes two changes to the bill, as it was reported out of the EPW Committee. The first change is to increase the penalty under section 6(a) of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act from $10,000 to $15,000. This change is not intended to affect the classification of the offense, which is currently a class B misdemeanor. Indeed, in United States v. Clavette, the ninth circuit held that the fine may be as much as $25,000 and still be considered a class B misdemeanor. 
The second change is to eliminate the higher penalty for persons who violate section 3(b) of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in connection with guiding, outfitting, or providing other service in exchange for money or other consideration. The intent of this provision was to discourage commercial operations from engaging in baiting in order to spur their business. However, the language in the reported bill was extremely broad. In addition, some existing laws, such as the Lacey Act, already provide that commercial operations may be subject to higher penalties. 
In lieu of the higher penalty for commercial operations, the amendment that I offer today provides a higher penalty for persons who violate section 3(b)(2) of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Section 3(b)(2) prohibits the placement of bait on or adjacent to an area for the purpose of causing, inducing, or allowing any person to take or attempt to take any migratory game bird by the aid of baiting on or over the baited area. This penalty would entail fines under title 28 of the United States Code, or imprisonment of not more than one year, or both. Baiting would thus be a class A misdemeanor. The purpose of this higher penalty is to send a strong message to the public that baiting is a serious offense. 
Mr. President, these changes have been discussed with Senator Breaux's staff, House Resources Committee staff, the administration, and the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and have met with the approval of all interested parties. I believe that this amendment improves the bill as passed by the committee. 
The second item included in the package is S. 2317, which makes several changes to the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. First, it removes three areas from the Refuge System that have lost the habitat value that led to their being incorporated into the Refuge System. Second, it changes the name of the Klamath Forest National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon to the Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge. The current name leads visitors to believe that it is a national forest, causing confusion over what activities are permitted. Finally, it reduces the penalty for unintentional violations of the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act. Currently, all violations of the act are class A misdemeanors, regardless of whether or not it was an intentional violation. Unintentional violations will now be a class B misdemeanor. 
The third item included in the package is S. 361, sponsored by Senator Jeffords and approved by the Committee on Environment and Public Works on July 22, 1998. This item prohibits the import, export and trade in products that contain, or that are labeled or advertised as containing, rhino and tiger parts, in an effort to reduce the supply and demand of those products in the United States. It requires a public outreach program in the United States to complement the prohibitions. Lastly, it reauthorizes the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act through 2002. 
As a related matter, I would like to note that even as Congress reaffirms and strengthens the laws for the conservation of rhinos and tigers, funding for implementation of these laws is woefully inadequate. This year--the Year of the Tiger--the administration requested only $400,000 for implementing the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. The Act is authorized to be appropriated up to $10 million annually. I strongly urge the administration, for fiscal year 2000, to request funding commensurate with the dire situation facing rhinos, and particularly tigers, in the wild. 
The fourth item included in the package is S. 1677, the Wetlands and Wildlife Enhancement Act of 1998. This bill reauthorizes the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA)--a law that has played a central role in the conservation of wetlands habitat across the continent. I introduced the bill last February, and have been joined by 58 of my colleagues from 42 States in sponsoring S. 1677. There are 35 Republican cosponsors and 23 Democrat cosponsors. This tremendous showing of bipartisan support is a tribute to one of the great success stories in wildlife conservation. 
The fifth item in the package includes provisions relating to protection of the Chesapeake Bay, and the research of pfiesteria. 
Mr. President, this package contains some very popular bills and very worthwhile conservation programs. It represents the fruits of many months of work by both the House Resources Committee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. In particular, I would like to thank Chairman Don Young and his staff, Harry Burroughs, for their cooperation on these bills, and in putting together this package.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senators Mack and Lieberman today to introduce the Credit for Early Action Act of 1998. This bipartisan legislation is designed to encourage voluntary, meaningful, and early efforts by industry to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. This is a bill to address the threat of global climate change. 
Before I get into the details of this legislative proposal, let me spend a few moments discussing the science of climate change. 
Human influence on the global climate in an extraordinarily complex matter that has undergone more than a century of research. Indeed, in an 1896 lecture delivered to the Stockholm Physics Society by the Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Svante Arrhenius, it was predicted that large increases in carbon dioxide (CO2) would result in a corresponding warming of the globe. 
Professor Arrhenius was the first to predict that large increases in CO2 would result in a warming of the globe. What have the world's scientists told us at different intervals over the last one hundred years, since Mr. Arrhenius identified the warming effects of CO2? 
In 1924, a U.S. physicist speculated that industrial activity would double atmospheric CO2 in five hundred years, around the year 2424. Current projections, however, call for a doubling sometime before 2050--some four hundred years earlier than predicted just seventy years ago! 
In 1957, scientists from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography reported for the first time that much of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere is not absorbed by the oceans as some had argued, leaving significant amounts in the atmosphere. They are said to have called carbon dioxide emissions `a large-scale geophysical experiment' with the Earth's climate. 
In 1967, the first reliable computer simulation calculated that global average temperatures may increase by more than four degrees Fahrenheit when atmospheric CO2 levels are double that of preindustrial times. In 1985, a conference sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the International Council of Scientific Unions forged a consensus of the international scientific community on the issue of climate change. The conference report warned that some future warming appears inevitable due to past emissions, regardless of future actions, and recommended consideration of a global treaty to address climate change. 
In 1987, an ice core from Antarctica, analyzed by French and Russian scientists, revealed an extremely close correlation between CO2 and temperature going back more than one hundred thousand years. In 1990, an appeal signed by forty-nine Novel prize winners and seven hundred members of the National Academy of Science stated, `There is broad agreement within the scientific community that amplification of the Earth's natural greenhouse effect by the buildup of various gases introduced by human activity has the potential to produce dramatic changes in climate . . . only by taking action now can be ensure that future generations will not be put at risk.' 
Also in 1990, seven hundred and forty-seven participants from one hundred sixteen countries took part in the Second world Climate Conference. The conference statement reported that, `. . . if the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations is not limited, the predicted climate change would place stresses on natural and social systems unprecedented in the past ten thousand years.' 
Finally, Mr. President, in 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, representing the consensus of climate scientists worldwide, concluded that `. . . the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.' 
This last development is significant, because the overwhelming majority of climate scientists concluded, for the first time, that man is influencing the global climate system. That conclusion, while controversial in some quarters, was endorsed unanimously by the governments of the ninety-six countries involved in the panel's efforts. 
Are these forecasted outcomes a certainty? They are not. The predictions of climate change are indeed based on numerous variables. Although scientists are improving the state of their knowledge at a rapid pace, we still have a lot to learn about the role of the sun, clouds and oceans, for example. 
The question is, will we ever have absolute certainty? Will we ever be able to eliminate all of the variables? The overwhelming majority of independent, peer-reviewed scientific studies indicate that we do not have such a luxury. By the time we finally attain absolute certainty, it would likely take centuries to reverse atmospheric damage and oceanic warming. 
Mr. President, I am not alone in this thinking. There are an increasing number of business leaders in our country who have arrived at the same conclusion that we need to act swiftly. 
In a `dear colleague' letter sent out this week under my signature, I repeated a remarkable statement issued by an impressive group of companies that have joined with the newly established Pew Center on Climate Change. American Electric Power, Boeing, BP America, Enron, Lockheed Martin, 3M, Sun, United Technologies, Toyota, Weyerhaeuser, and several others said that, `we accept the views of most scientists that enough is known about the science and environmental impacts of climate change for us to take actions to address its consequences.' 
The legislation to be introduced today by Senator Mack, Senator Lieberman and I proposes an exciting framework that would appropriately recognize real and immediate action to combat climate change. While the climate debate will indeed continue over the next few years, we strongly believe that there is a voluntary, incentive-based approach which can be implemented now. Congressional approval of this approach, which the three of us and others will work for early next year, will provide the certainty necessary to encourage companies to move forward with practical, near-term emission reductions. 
Specifically, this legislation would provide a mechanism by which the President can enter into binding greenhouse gas reduction agreements with entities operating in the United States. Once executed, these agreements will provide credits for voluntary greenhouse gas reductions effected by those entities before 2008, or whenever we might have an imposition of any domestic or international emission reduction requirements. 
Importantly, this program is designed to work within the framework of whatever greenhouse gas control requirement may eventually become applicable within the United States. The credits would be usable beginning in the first five-year budget period (2008-2012) under the Kyoto Protocol, if the Kyoto Protocol is ratified. If the Protocol is not ratified, and we end up with a domestic program to regulate or otherwise control greenhouse gas emissions, the credits would be usable in that program. 
This sort of approach makes sense for a wide variety of reasons. Encouraging early reductions can begin to slow the rate of buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, helping to minimize the potential 
environmental risks of continued warming. Given the longevity of many climate gases, which continue to trap heat in the atmosphere for a century or more, it just makes sense to encourage practical actions now. 
By guaranteeing companies credit for voluntary early reductions, the bill would allow companies to protect themselves against the potential for steep reduction requirements or excessive costs in the future. For companies that want to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, providing credit for action now adds years to any potential compliance schedule, allowing companies to spread costs over broader time periods. A focus on early reductions can help stimulate the American search for strategies an technologies that are needed worldwide. Development of such strategies and technologies can improve American competitiveness in the $300 billion dollar global environmental marketplace. 
This `credit' program may also make the greenhouse gas reductions achieved before regulations are in place financially valuable to the companies who make such reductions. Given the likely inclusion of market based approaches to any eventual domestic regulatory requirements, similar to the successful acid rain program of the 1990 Clean Air Act, credit earned could be traded or sold to help other companies manage their own reduction efforts. 
Under a `no credit' approach, the status quo, it is more likely that early reduction companies will be penalized if greenhouse gas reductions are ultimately required, because their competitors who wait to reduce will get credit for later reductions. Such a `no credit' approach could even create perverse incentives to delay investments until emissions reductions would be credited. 
In anticipation of a potential global emissions market, decisions re being made now by entrepreneurial companies and countries. For example, Russia and Japan have already concluded a trade of greenhouse gas emission credits. Private companies such as Niagara-Mohawk and Canada-based Suncor are moving forward with cross-boundary trades. Aggressive global energy companies, such as British Petroleum, AEP, and PacifiCorp are already implementing agreements in Central and South America--sequestering carbon and developing credits against emissions--by protecting rain forests. 
Mr. President, America can and should reward companies that take such positive steps to position themselves, and the US, for the environmental and economic future. 
On the international side, passage by the U.S. Congress of a program to help stimulate early action will be clear example of American leadership and responsibility. Developing countries currently argue that nations such as the United States, with huge advantages in quality of life and dramatically higher per capita emissions of green house gases, should take a leadership role in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. And they argue that developing countries should not be asked to take steps until the U.S. begins to move forward. This bill can work directly to change that situation, therefore removing a barrier to essential developing country progress. 
There it is, Mr. President. We are here today because we believe that climate change presents a serious threat. We believe it makes sense to get started now. And, as many leading American companies do, we believe that there are sensible, fair and voluntary methods to get on the right track. 
We encourage our colleagues to use the time between now and next January to review this legislation carefully. We are open to suggestions. Most importantly, we are looking for others to join us in this effort.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the late Joseph Pinga, a community leader who passed away on September 1st, in West Warwick, Rhode Island. Mr. Pinga was best known for his community giving and his vigilance that helped to reform the West Warwick town government. 
Mr. Pinga served honorably in the U.S. Navy and worked to establish his business, Westcott Baking Company, of which he was the owner and operator for over forty years. In this capacity, Mr. Pinga was regarded not only as a local pioneer, but also as a defender of rights for small business owners. In fact, in 1978, Time Magazine recognized Joe's perseverance in an article about his struggle with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
Joseph Pinga certainly was a believer in community involvement. Numerous charitable organizations could always count on Mr. Pinga's generosity without ever requesting any public acknowledgement. In addition, Joe ran for mayor of West Warwick in 1990 and was a member of the local Elks Lodge. 
Mr. President, I join with all Rhode Islanders in extending to Mr. Pinga's family our sympathy and best wishes.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, next month a very special school will be celebrating its 20th anniversary. On November 15th, 1978, the Ruth and Max Alperian Schechter Day School in Providence, Rhode Island opened its doors to ten students. Today, its classrooms are filled with over 230 students, and it is one of the fastest growing Jewish institutions in Rhode Island. 
The Ruth and Max Alperian Schechter Day School is a state accredited, egalitarian, conservative Jewish Day School serving children from kindergarten through grade eight. In addition to having a fine reputation for providing its students with a well-rounded education, the Alperian Schechter Day School also focuses on academic growth, ethical values, and Jewish identity. Its academic programs are both rich and challenging in general and Judaic studies. 
Recognizing that a partnership with parents is essential to the education of our youngsters, the Alperian Schechter Day School continues to promote open communication with families. As a community of learners, the entire school body works together to create a community of successful, well-rounded members while encouraging continued learning and increased participation in school activities. 
In fact, students from the Alperian Schechter Day School continue to build on their education, even after graduating. As academic advisors work with families and students to ensure future success, Alperian Schechter Day School graduates have gone on to attend a variety of colleges and universities including, Yale University, Harvard University, University of Rhode Island, Georgetown University, Rhode Island School of Design, and many, many other fine institutions of higher learning. In addition, students have had the opportunity to serve as interns in our nation's capital, build houses with Habitat for Humanity, and work with disabled children. 
In closing, I want to congratulate the Ruth and Max Alperian Schechter Day School on its 20th Anniversary and hope for its continued success in providing academic excellence to our youngsters.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering S. 1970, the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1998, introduced by Senator Abraham. I am also pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation. The bill would establish a program to provide financial assistance for projects to promote the conservation of neotropical migratory birds in the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. 
Each autumn, some 5 billion birds from 500 species migrate between their breeding grounds in North America and tropical habitats in the Caribbean, Central and South America. These neotropical migrants--or New World tropical migrants--are birds that migrate between the biogeographic region stretching across Mexico, Central America, much of the Caribbean, and the northern part of South America. 
The natural challenges facing these migratory birds are profound. These challenges have been exacerbated by human-induced impacts, particularly the continuing loss of habitat in the Caribbean and Latin America. As a result, populations of migratory birds have declined generally in recent years. 
While there are numerous efforts underway to protect these species and their habitat, they generally focus on specific groups of migratory birds or specific regions in the Americas. There is a need for a more comprehensive program to address the varied and significant threats facing the numerous species of migratory birds across their range. 
Frequently there is little, if any, coordination among the existing programs, nor is there any one program that serves as a link among them. A broader, more holistic approach would bolster existing conservation efforts and programs, fill the gaps between these programs, and promote new initiatives.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider S. 2131, the Water Resources Development Act of 1998. This measure, similar to water resources legislation enacted in 1986, 1988, 19990, 1992, and 1996, is comprised of water resources project and study authorizations and policy modifications for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works program.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering S. 361, sponsored by Senator Jeffords and approved by the Committee on Environment and Public Works on July 22, 1998. Rhinos and tigers are some of the most critically endangered species on the planet. Fewer than 7,500 tigers survive in the world today, and of the eight subspecies that have been identified, three are extinct. Another subspecies in South China is on the brink of extinction, with a population of about 20 animals. 
Rhinos number between 11,000 and 13,500, with two species in Africa and three in Asia. Two of the Asian species themselves are on the verge of extinction, with the Javan rhino having less than 100 individuals, and the Sumatran rhino having less than 500. 
The reason for the recent decline of rhinos and tigers, and the primary immediate threat to their survival is the same--poaching. The reason for the poaching itself is also the same--parts of both rhinos and tigers are used in traditional Asian medicines. 
In 1994, Congress passed the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act to help conserve rhinos and tigers. The Act established the `Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund' to receive funds appropriated by Congress, as well as donations, to fund conservation projects. Since its enactment, Congress has appropriated $1 million for the program, funding 40 projects in 10 range countries in Africa and Asia. 
Despite this program and recent efforts by the Parties to CITES, trade of traditional Asian medicine containing rhino and tiger parts continues to be high, particularly in Asia and the United States. Neither the ESA not CITES allow for the interdiction of products that are labeled or advertised as containing substances derived from rhinos or tigers, without evidence that the products in fact contain these substances. Such evidence, at best, would be extremely difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to acquire, and at worst, would be impossible to acquire. 
The bill amends the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act to address this problem. It prohibits products that contain, or are labeled or advertised as containing, rhino and tiger parts, in an effort to reduce the supply and demand of those products in the United States. It requires a public outreach program in the United States to complement the prohibitions. Lastly, it reauthorizes the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act through 2002. 
As a related matter, I would like to note that even as Congress reaffirms and strengthens the laws for the conservation of rhinos and tigers, funding for implementation of these laws is woefully inadequate. This year--the Year of the Tiger--the Administration requested only $400,000 for implementing the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act. The Act is authorized to be appropriated up to $10 million annually. I strongly urge the Administration, for FY 2000, to request funding commensurate with the dire situation facing rhinos, and particularly tigers, in the wild. I also would like to note that the Act allows for donations to be made to the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund, and I urge both corporations and individuals to make donations to this Fund. 
I wish to thank my colleagues for considering this bill, and I urge the House to approve it expeditiously, so that it can then be signed by the President. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to commend my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, for her herculean efforts in developing this legislation. She has worked tirelessly with other Senators, the House, and numerous stakeholders, including industry groups and environmental groups alike. The bill she introduces today reflects her tremendous dedication to this issue. 
I also applaud Senator Landrieu's efforts to shape this legislation into a significant conservation initiative. Her legislation includes two titles devoted to environmental protection--title II for funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), and title III for funding non-game species protection by the States, known as Teaming with Wildlife. These worthwhile programs have not received the attention or funding they deserve on their own, and the inclusion in this legislation gives them an opportunity to fulfill their potential. In particular, the LWCF was created in 1964 with the principle that revenues from a resource extraction activity--offshore oil drilling--should be reinvested in the acquisition and protection of other natural resources with lasting value. Senator Landrieu's bill remains true to this principle.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with Senator Moynihan, the `Federal Employee Flexibility Act of 1998,' a bill that would provide flexibility and choices for Federal employees. This flexibility was provided to private sector employees in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, so-called TEA 21. We believe that these provisions provide to employers and employees important new flexibility which should reduce single occupant vehicle trips from our highways and therefore contribute to reduced congestion, a cleaner environment, and increased energy conservation. 
The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century include significant changes to the way the Internal Revenue Code treats employer-provided transportation fringe benefits. Unfortunately, we have become aware that personnel compensation law for Federal employees restricts implementation of this new flexibility. 
Prior to enactment of these two bills, the Federal tax code provided that employer-provided parking is not subject to Federal taxation, up to $170 per month. However, this tax exemption was lost for all employees if the parking was offered in lieu of compensation for just one employee. In other words, if an employer gave just one employee a choice between parking and some other benefit (such as a transit pass, or increased salary), the parking of all other employees in the company became taxable. It goes without saying that no employers jeopardized a 
tax benefit for the overwhelming majority of their employees to provide flexibility to others. In effect, the tax code prohibited employers from offering their employees a choice. Parking was a take-it or leave-it benefit. 
The changes in these two laws make it possible for employers to offer their employees more choices by eliminating the take-it or leave-it restriction in the Federal tax code. Employees whose only transportation benefit is parking can now instead accept a salary enhancement, and find other means to get to work such as car pooling, van pooling, biking, walking, or taking transit. 
Unfortunately, Federal employees will not be able to benefit from the increased flexibility available to private sector employees, unless Federal compensation law is modified. Current Federal law provides that a Federal employee may not receive additional pay unless specifically authorized by law. Therefore, a Federal employee could not `cash out' a parking space at work, and instead receive cash or other benefits. 
To address this limitation for transit passes and similar benefits, the `Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act' allows the Federal government to provide transit benefits, bicycle services, and non-monetary incentives to employees. However, when this legislation was enacted, the Federal tax code prohibited the so-called `cash out' option discussed above, and therefore was not included in the list of transportation-related exemptions in that statute. 
The short and simple bill we introduce today would add `taxable cash reimbursement for the value of an employer-provided parking space' to the list of benefits that can be received by Federal employees. 
Let me assure my colleagues and Federal employees that this bill would not require that Federal employees lose their parking spaces, as may be feared when there is discussion of Federal employee parking spaces. The bill simply provides Federal employees the same flexibility that is available to private sector employees. Employees who want to retain their tax-free parking space would be free to do so. 
We think it is vital that the Federal government show leadership on the application of new and innovative ways to solve our transportation and environmental problems. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill and that we can act swiftly on it in the next session of Congress.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support for the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Promotion Act of 1998, or the Duck Stamp Act as it is more commonly known. 
In 1934 President Roosevelt signed into law the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act (Act). The Act required that all waterfowl hunters 16 years of age and over must annually purchase and carry a Federal Duck Stamp. The revenue generated from duck stamp sales is earmarked for the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund to buy or lease waterfowl sanctuaries. As a result, many of the nation's wildlife refuges have been purchased in whole or part with duck stamp funds. 
Although the Duck Stamp program has been extremely successful, the Act does not provide funds to market and advertise duck stamps. This legislation authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to use up to $1 million a year in duck stamp receipts until 2003 for marketing purposes. To ensure that this program is a success the marketing plan has to be approved by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission prior to implementation. 
Duck stamp sales could increase substantially if funds were available to market the stamp, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support H.R. 4248.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support today for S. 2095, legislation to reauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act of 1984. This legislation makes important changes in the Foundation's charter, changes that I believe will allow the Foundation to build on its fine record of providing funding for conservation of our nation's fish, wildlife and plant resources. 
The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation was established in 1984, to bring together diverse groups to engage in conservation projects across America and, in some cases, around the world. Since its inception, the Foundation has made more than 2,300 grants totaling over $270 million. This is an impressive record of accomplishment. The Foundation has pioneered some notable conservation programs, including implementing the North American Waterfowl Management plan, Partners in Flight for neotropical birds, Bring Back the Natives Program, the Exxon Save the Tiger Fund, and the establishment of the Conservation Plan for Sterling Forest in New York and New Jersey, to name just a few. 
Mr. President, the Foundation has funded these programs by raising private funds to match federal appropriations on at least a 2 to 1 basis. During this time of fiscal constraint this is an impressive record of leveraging federal dollars. Moreover, all of the Foundation's operating costs are raised privately, which means that federal and private dollars given for conservation is spent only on conservation projects. 
Mr. President, this legislation is quite simple. It makes three key changes to current law. First, the bill would expand the Foundation's governing Board of Directors from 15 members to 25 members. This will allow a greater number of those with a strong interest in conservation to actively participate in, and contribute to, the Foundation's activities. 
The bill's second key feature authorizes the Foundation to work with other agencies within the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce, in addition to the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Mr. President, it is my view that the Foundation should continue to provide valuable assistance to government agencies within the Departments of the Interior and Commerce that may be faced with conservation issues. Finally, it would reauthorize appropriations to the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce through 2003. 
Mr. President, I believe that this legislation will produce real conservation benefits, and I strongly urge my colleagues to give the bill their support.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this bill contains a rider that addresses methyl bromide use. It is an anti-environmental rider offered by a few members of the other party, and slipped into the bill by the conference committee. It has not been debated by either body, and yet this language amends the Clean Air Act and constrains our ability to negotiate a more rapid phase-out of methyl bromide use with other nations. 
Just last week, the White House, and specifically Vice President Gore, called on the Congress to end what he called `backdoor assaults' on the environment. I sincerely hope that the President and Vice President mean that to apply to all anti-environmental riders, including the ones offered by their own party. 
This methyl bromide rider began as an effort to address a legitimate problem, but changes sought by a few members of the other party go too far. Methyl bromide is highly toxic and a potent ozone depleting compound. It is also one of the most widely used pesticides in the United States. The 1994 Montreal Protocol requires a gradual phase-out of methyl bromide beginning next year. Industrialized countries have agreed to a phase-out by 2005, while developing nations must phase-out methyl bromide by 2015. In the United States, the Clean Air Act requires an even earlier phase-out date for methyl bromide--January 1, 2001. 
I share the concern that the Clean Air Act's accelerated phase-out schedule might put our farmers at a competitive disadvantage. However, I believe that addressing this problem in the context of an appropriations bill is entirely inappropriate. Putting constraints on an international treaty and modifying a major environmental statute demands thoughtful debate. To do this with a rider on an appropriations bill allows almost no debate. 
The principle argument for action on methyl bromide has been the potential competitive disadvantage for American agriculture. As I said, I am sympathetic to that problem, and I support the idea that we should allow the Montreal Protocol to dictate the phase-out in this nation. But the language added to this bill would prohibit any phase-out earlier than the date currently contained in the Protocol--2005. 
Could the deadline for phase-out be accelerated if, a few years down the road, the international community decides that effective, affordable alternatives to methyl bromide exist? Not if we approve this rider. This language says that--no matter what--the United States will not end methyl bromide use before 2005. The international community is not going to negotiate an earlier date, because they know that the U.S. will not comply with an earlier date. Inclusion of that language guarantees that worldwide methyl bromide use will continue until 2005. 
This is an inappropriate limitation on our options regarding methyl bromide and our ability to negotiate changes to an international treaty. More importantly, a last minute appropriations rider is a bad way to amend the Clean Air Act. I can only hope that the President, the Vice President, and Democratic Senators who have spoken against other riders intend to oppose all anti-environmental riders, not just those offered by Republicans. 
Mr. President, I am distressed over the methyl bromide amendment which is an antienvironmental rider that was put into this conference report. It wasn't debated by either body, yet the language amends the Clean Air Act and constrains our ability to negotiate a more rapid phaseout of methyl bromide when used by other nations. 
I point out that the principal argument for action on methyl bromide has been the potential competitive disadvantage for American agriculture. I am sympathetic of that, and I support the idea we should allow the Montreal Protocol to dictate the phaseout of this. If we don't like it, then we should amend it. 
The present time for the phaseout is 2005 but could be earlier. What this legislation does is makes it no later than 2005 but prevents it from being earlier than 2005. In those intervening 7 years, there well could be developed an alternative to methyl bromide. I think this is an unfortunate provision in the bill. I thank the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have sent to the desk a manager's amendment to H.R. 8, a bill that was reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee on a voice vote. Mr. President, H.R. 8 was developed to address part of the air pollution in southern California that has proven difficult to control. The pollution source in question is emissions from cars and trucks crossing into the San Diego area from Mexico. Those of us who work on the problems of air pollution are well aware of the strict auto emissions standards California has put in place in an effort to meet national air quality standards. Many of the cars crossing the border from Mexico greatly exceed the standards that California cars are expected to meet. 
California has an extremely difficult task in trying to improve its air quality. The State is working to reduce emissions from nearly every conceivable source. The excess emissions from cross-border traffic is estimated to be 13 percent of the excess pollution from cars and trucks in the San Diego area. 
So, H.R. 8 was written to allow cars to be checked as they come across the border to ensure that those cars coming into the U.S. on a regular basis comply with State emission standards. California State law already requires this, but without a border check, the law has been impossible to enforce. 
This matter has been widely recognized as one that H.R. 8 can be helpful in addressing, and as I have said, the bill was approved by a voice vote in the committee. 
Today, I am submitting a manager's amendment to remedy some concerns raised by a few Senators about how the bill might apply to other states. The amendment will ensure that this bill is neutral with respect to all parts of the U.S. border with Mexico or Canada except the California-Mexico border, where the real problem is. Another change made by the amendment will focus the bill more narrowly on regular commuters as opposed to the occasional visitor on a shopping trip. 
Mr. President, it is my understanding that this amendment has already been reviewed and approved by the minority. These changes also have been cleared by both the majority and minority on the House Commerce Committee, as well as by Congressman Bilbray, the bill's sponsor. 
I would urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and pass H.R. 8.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to provide relief to communities for whom air transportation is vital to their survival. 
Last year, Congress altered the structure of the aviation excise tax which funds the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. As part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the 10% ad valorem ticket tax was replaced with a combination ad valorem/flight segment charge. When fully phased in, the tax will consist of an ad valorem tax of 7.5% of the price of a ticket and a $3.00 charge per flight segment. 
This change has dramatically increased the tax imposed on low-fare flights. A typical flight to or from the Block Island community located in my state costs $28. Prior to last year, the tax on this flight would be 10% or $2.80. When fully implemented, however, the new structure will increase the tax on the same ticket by 82%, to $5.10. 
This new structure was intended to provide a user-based approach to paying for the use of FAA services and facilities. However, short distance flights between islands and a mainland make little demand on Air Traffic Control services as these flight segments do not use ATC centers, rarely use departure or arrive control, often operate under visual flight rules and usually are transferred from the departure control tower to the destination control tower. 
Congress recognized that this new tax structure would adversely affect rural communities. Consequently, flights to or from rural airports are taxed at a rate of 7.5% of the ticket price, with no per passenger segment charge. For purposes of this exemption, a rural airport is one that is located at least 75 miles away from an airport with more than 100,000 passengers. Unfortunately, this restrictive definition fails to recognize the unique nature of island communities. 
Island communities face transportation problems similar to those encountered by passengers from rural areas. Air and ferry transportation provide islands with a vital link to the mainland for shopping, employment, health care, and other needs. Most commercial passenger enplanements at island airports are for short-distance flights simply to get off the island. For those communities, air and ferry service maintain a delicate balance, and both are needed to meet the communities' needs for mainland access. 
The current excise tax structure provides a disincentive to providing service to remote island communities. This result is contrary to Congress' intent to increase air service to these remote communities. 
My legislation reinstates the prior tax structure for flights to or from an island community. Thus, a passenger flying to or from such a community would pay a tax equal to 10% of the price of a ticket. It is important to note that this is less favorable than the exemption currently provided to passengers to and from rural airports. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this important health initiative.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, together with Senators Baucus, Grassley, Moseley-Braun, Rockefeller, and Kerrey of Nebraska, the Structured Settlement Protection Act. Companion legislation has been introduced in the House as H.R. 4314, cosponsored by Representative Clay Shaw and Pete Stark and a broad bipartisan group of members of the House Ways and Means Committee. 
The Act protects structured settlements and the injured victims who are the recipients of the structured settlement payments from the problems caused by a growing practice known as structured settlement factoring. 
Structured settlements were developed because of the pitfalls associated with the traditional lump sum form of recovery in serious personal injury cases, where all too often a lump sum meant to last for decades or even a lifetime swiftly eroded away. Structured settlements have proven to be a very valuable tool. They provide long-term financial security in the form of an assured stream of payments to persons suffering serious, often profoundly disabling, physical injuries. These payments enable the recipients to meet ongoing medical and basic living expenses without having to resort to the social safety net. 
Congress has adopted special tax rules to encourage and govern the use of structured settlements in physical injury cases. By encouraging the use of structured settlements Congress sought to shield victims and their families from pressures to prematurely dissipate their recoveries. Structured settlement payments are nonassignable. This is consistent with worker's compensation payments and various types of Federal disability payments which 
are also non-assignable under applicable law. In each case, this is done to preserve the injured person's long-term financial security. 
I am very concerned that in recent months there has been sharp growth in so-called structured settlement factoring transactions. In these transactions, companies induce injured victims to sell off future structured settlement payments for a steeply-discounted lump sum, thereby unraveling the structured settlement and the crucial long-term financial security that it provides to the injured victim. These factoring company purchases directly contravene the intent and policy of Congress in enacting the special structured settlement tax rules. The Treasury Department shares these concerns as is evidenced with a similar proposal included in the Administration's FY 1999 budget. 
Court records from across the country are shedding light on factoring company purchases of structured settlement payments from gravely-injured victims. Recent cases involve a quadriplegic in Oklahoma, a paraplegic in Texas, a person in Connecticut with traumatic brain injuries dating from childhood, and an injured worker receiving workers' compensation in Mississippi. Realizing the long-term risk being inflicted on these seriously-injured individuals, this legislation has the active support of the National Spinal Cord Injury Association, as well as the American Association of Persons With Disabilities (AAPD). 
The National Spinal Cord Injury Association recently wrote to the Chairman of the Finance Committee strongly supporting the legislation. They state: `[o]ver the past 16 years, structured settlements have proven to be an ideal method for ensuring that persons with disabilities, particularly minors, are not tempted to squander resources designed to last years or even a lifetime. That is why the National Spinal Cord Injury Association is so deeply concerned about the emergence of companies that purchase payments intended for disabled persons at drastic discount. This strikes at the heart of the security Congress intended when it created structured settlements.' 
It is appropriate to address this problem through the federal tax system because these purchases directly contravene the Congressional policy reflected in the structured settlement tax rules and jeopardize the long-term financial security that Congress intended to provide for the injured victim. This problem is nationwide, and it is growing rapidly. 
Accordingly, the legislation we are introducing would impose substantial penalty tax on a factoring company that purchases the structured settlement payments from the injured victim. This is a penalty, not a tax increase. Similar penalties are imposed in a variety of other contexts in the Internal Revenue Code to discourage transactions that undermine Code provisions, such as private foundation prohibited transactions and greenmail. The factoring company would pay the penalty only if it engages in the transaction that Congress has sought to discourage. An exception is provided for genuine court-approved hardship cases to protect the limited instances where a true hardship warrants the sale of a structured settlement. 
This bipartisan legislation, which is supported by the Treasury Department, should be enacted as soon as possible to stem this growing nationwide problem.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, like my friend from Arkansas, I am concerned about the effect that mail order sales companies have on local retailers. I have no axe to grind with these businesses, and in fact applaud their ability to provide a very important service to many Americans. The convenience of this type of purchasing is good for the consumer. 
What does concern me is the possibility that mail order and other direct sales companies' popularity is on the rise simply because they are not required to collect state sales taxes. I do not know if that is the true reason for their growth, but I would be concerned if they are taking advantage of what may be, in effect, an uneven playing field. Remember, local merchants, who compete with direct sales companies for business, have no opportunity to avoid collecting sales tax on their transactions. 
Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas raises a very important issue, and I am glad that the Senate has had the opportunity to debate it this morning. But this is a complicated issue, and cannot be fully considered over a few hours of debate on the floor of the Senate. 
I have several questions about the proposal offered by the Senator from Arkansas. For example, is it reasonable to set the exemption level at $3 million of annual sales? Is the per state exemption level of $100,000 in annual sales an appropriate level? On whom should this obligation be imposed? 
Mr. President, these are just some of the questions that the Advisory Commission should be given the opportunity to explore. It may be that when this issue is fully reviewed, the Congress will decide that the approach proposed by the Senator from Arkansas is the correct one. But I don't think we can make that judgment today, and that is why I am voting to table this amendment. 
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has approved legislation which I cosponsored to help ensure the safety of our nation's schools. Senators Campbell, Jeffords, and Faircloth introduced S.2235, `The School Resource Officers Partnership Grant Act of 1998,' in June. It was approved unanimously by the Judiciary Committee and approved by the Senate yesterday. 
The goal of this legislation is to help put a stop to crime and violence in our nation's schools. Through this legislation, partnerships will be developed between state and local law enforcement agencies and the school districts in which they serve. While national statistics on violence in schools indicate an overall downward trend, the types of violence that have occurred recently, particularly in the last school year, are nothing short of traumatic. 
The sight and sound of schoolyard shootings have become all too familiar. Americans were shocked, time and time again, by the devastating sight on the evening news of youngsters being carried to ambulances from school grounds following shooting sprees by other youngsters. Looking back at the 1997-1998 school year, several particularly alarming incidents occurred: 
In October, a 16-year-old at Pearl High School in Mississippi went to school with a hunting rifle. He shot and killed a student and a teacher, leaving a second teacher with a bullet wound in the head. 
In December, a student at Heath High School in West Paducah, Kentucky used a pistol to kill 3 other students. The shooter was 14-years-old. 
In March, 2 boys in Jonesboro, Arkansas, an eleven year-old and a thirteen year-old, pulled the fire alarm in their school. As students and teachers left the building, the two boys began shooting. They killed five people: four young girls and a teacher. 
In April, a 14-year-old boy in Edinboro, Pennsylvania went to a school dance with a gun he apparently removed from his father's bureau drawer. He killed a science teacher and injured two students and another teacher. 
At Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon a 15-year-old who was suspended for carrying a gun to school, returned to school the next day and opened fire in a crowded cafeteria. He killed two students and wounded 19 others. Police suspect he shot and killed his parents, as well. 
It is no secret that I support tougher restrictions on gun ownership. Earlier this year, Senator Durbin and I offered an amendment to the spending bill for the Departments of Commerce, State and Justice. Our amendment would have held adult gun owners responsible if their weapon--which had not been stored properly--was used by a child to injure himself or someone else. I felt that this was the least we could do to help protect children from needless gun violence. Unfortunately, the majority of my Senate colleagues didn't agree, and our amendment was defeated. 
Despite that setback, I believe that it is Congress' responsibility to take steps to assist local communities in their battle against school violence. Children bringing weapons to school and drug use among youngsters aren't problems of big city schools alone. In my own State of Rhode Island during the last school year, there were more than 400 weapons-related suspensions. To put that number in the proper perspective, we have fewer than 450 elementary and secondary schools in Rhode Island, including private and religious schools. We should not fool ourselves into thinking that the kind of atrocities that all of America witnessed in schools last year can't happen in our children's schools. 
It is my sincere belief that The School Resource Officers Partnership Grant Act is a step in the right direction. This legislation will make federal funds available to local law enforcement agencies, working in partnership with local school districts, for `school resource officers.' These SROs, who must be professional law enforcement officers, would address gang-related crime and violence, including drug use, in and around schools. They would work with students, teachers, and administrators on crime prevention and personal safety. And perhaps most importantly, they would work directly with students on conflict resolution to help avert violent oubursts that can leave innocent children dead or injured. 
There are communities throughout our nation whose police officers have undertaken these very tasks. In Rhode Island, police officers in Newport, Providence, and West Warwick, to name a few, already are working within schools on crime prevention, mentoring, and conflict resolution. Our bill would allow local law enforcement agencies to use a portion of their federal Community Policing funds for these officers. 
I applaud our teachers and administrators for their efforts to confront and address violence in schools, but we cannot expect them to undertake this battle alone. This bill will make the knowledge and resources of professional law enforcement agencies available to our schools. I know it will help keep our children safe.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to have an opportunity to talk about S. 1677, the Wetlands and Wildlife Enhancement Act of 1998. This bill will reauthorize the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA)--a law that has played a central role in the conservation of wetlands habitat across the continent. 
I am joined by 58 of my colleagues from 42 states in sponsoring S. 1677. There are 35 Republican cosponsors and 23 Democrat cosponsors. This tremendous showing of bipartisan support is a tribute to one of the great success stories in wildlife conservation. NAWCA has helped to bring about the recovery of more than 30 species of ducks, geese, and other waterfowl and migratory birds from their lowest population numbers just 12 years ago to some of their highest population numbers this year. 
Why was NAWCA originally enacted? In the early 1980's, we were alarmed to discover that populations of duck and other waterfowl had plummeted precipitously. The numbers were stark: in only ten years, breeding populations of ducks fell an average of 31 percent, with some species declining by as much as 61 percent. This decline was due to several factors, including loss of habitat and an extended drought in many parts of the U.S. 
In 1986, the U.S. and Canada worked cooperatively to develop the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. Mexico joined the plan in 1994, so that the entire continent now participates in this effort. The Plan established ambitious goals and innovative strategies for conserving waterfowl habitat. 
Under the leadership of Senator George Mitchell, Congress approved NAWCA in 1989, primarily as a vehicle to implement the Plan. The law provides a permanent funding source for wetlands conservation projects, many of which fall under the auspices of the plan. 
These sources include Federal appropriations, interest generated from short-term investments on the Pitman-Robertson Fund, money from the Wallop-Breaux Fund, and fines collected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. All told, NAWCA received $43 million this past year, of which $11.7 million was appropriated. 
Since NAWCA's inception, 575 projects involving more than 800 partners have received $240 million in Federal funds under NAWCA, matched by more than $360 million in non-Federal funds. These projects have covered about 3.8 million acres throughout the continent. 
These numbers are impressive, but in the scheme of things, NAWCA is a relatively modest law. Even so, it enjoys broad support. This is because, quite simply, NAWCA works. In fact, it works so well that it should serve as a model for other environmental laws. I would like to outline what I believe are the four components of its success--and thus, it popularity. 
1. NAWCA focuses on habitat conservation as the key to saving species. 
Ducks and other waterfowl are extraordinarily dependent on climate. They need wet weather to thrive. During years of drought, waterfowl populations dwindle. If their habitat vanishes as well, waterfowl populations do not stand a chance of rebounding when the rains return. 
The beauty of NAWCA is that it seeks to protect the habitat itself, whether the waterfowl are there or not. That way, when the rains come and the waterfowl return, the habitat is waiting for them. Thus, habitat conservation is the means to achieve the end of waterfowl protection. If waterfowl--or any other creatures threatened with population decline or extinction--are going to survive, they must have available habitat capable of sustaining them. 
In focusing on wetlands habitat, NAWCA reaches far 
beyond waterfowl species. Also sharing the same habitat are migratory birds, raptors, songbirds, shorebirds, and even black bears, otters, and other mammals. Among these species, the habitat is the common currency--protect the habitat and you protect all of them. 
Professor E.O. Wilson has said,  
When a natural ecosystem, say a forest remnant or a freshwater stream, is protected to save a particular species, an umbrella is thrown over hundreds or thousands of other species . . . [and,] the great panoply of lesser known, often unknown, and frequently invisible organisms are what sustain natural environments. 
This is a basic principle of biology. However, NAWCA has transformed this principle into design. Let me read from the 1989 Senate Committee Report on the original NAWCA: 
One of the purposes of this legislation . . . is to broaden the focus of [the North American Waterfowl Management] Plan with respect to conservation of wetland ecosystems and the other migratory birds and other fish and wildlife dependent thereon. 
This purpose was further reinforced in 1994, when the plan was amended to explicitly consider the needs of migratory birds when developing projects. 
2. NAWCA makes use of coordinated, comprehensive, continent-wide planning to achieve its wetlands conservation goals. 
It is important to protect habitat, but the key is knowing which land to protect. This is where the North American Waterfowl Management Plan comes in. Without the Plan, NAWCA would be just another grants program, giving money to worthy projects for a worthy cause, but without any sense of the whole picture. The Plan identifies broad goals and strategies for recovering waterfowl populations across North America. Ten joint ventures across all four flyways have been formed to refine the goals and strategies for their specific regions. The joint ventures also coordinate projects to conserve wetlands. 
Partnerships among Federal, State, conservation groups, and landowners--big or small--form to develop projects and submit proposals for Federal matching money under NAWCA. The proposals are then reviewed by the North American Wetlands Conservation Council, which makes recommendations to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, which then approves the funding. The Council consists of nine members, as follows: the Director of the Service; the Secretary of the Board for the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; four directors of State and wildlife agencies, one from each of the four flyways; and three representatives of charitable and nonprofit organizations actively participating in wetlands conservation projects. The State agency directors and the representatives of charitable and nonprofit organizations are appointed by the Secretary for three-year terms. 
Thus, the plan and act work in concert with one another, beginning with broad planning guidelines for the entire continent, and ending with individual projects for protecting and managing specific acres in our very communities. 
A perfect example of this holistic approach is an initiative in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, which stretches from the mouth of the Mississippi River up into Tennessee. This is where the cutting edge of conservation planning is taking place. Through modern satellite imagery and GIS technology, habitat types can be identified and mapped. This ecological mapping is then compared with land ownership, giving Federal, State, and local governments, as well as private owners, an idea of the most important lands to conserve. The result? Areas of habitat fragmentation can be pinpointed, and reforestation and wetlands restoration can be targeted to meet the needs of sensitive and declining species. 
3. NAWCA relies on public-private partnerships to achieve its wetlands conservation goals. 
The partners are a big reason for NAWCA's success. Instead of the heavy hand of government regulation, NAWCA's wetlands conservation goals are achieved by voluntary cooperative partnerships involving very diverse people and organizations--businesses, nonprofit environmental groups, hunters, farmers, state, tribal, and local governments, and of course the federal government. Under the auspices of NAWCA, people and groups with widely divergent, often opposing points of view have found common ground in wetlands. The kind of cooperation that NAWCA has engendered is heartening indeed. Through this work to achieve the goals of the plan, a broad array of people have had the opportunity to develop a deep and abiding appreciation of wetlands and the need to protect them. 
None has contributed to the program more than Ducks Unlimited, nor has anyone been more vital to its success. That organization alone has contributed in total about $20 million to the projects in the U.S., and about another $60 million to projects in Canada and Mexico. The Nature Conservancy has also been a tremendous supporter of the program, contributing $17 million to projects in the U.S. and another $4 million to projects in Canada. However, these groups do more than raise money. They educate landowners, coordinate partnerships, and give the program the exposure it deserves. Because DU plays such an important role, we are amending S. 1677 to place them on the Council for one additional term of 3 years, while at the same time requiring the Service to develop a policy, subject to notice and comment rulemaking procedures, to develop a fair and formal process for making future appointments to the Council. I expect the Service to balance the policy between groups such as DU and TNC, whose support is invaluable, and between other groups that might be smaller but who bring new ideas and new forms of participation to the program. 
NAWCA has also reached out to private landowners across the continent--small, family owned farms, large developers, and private individuals. In my own State of Rhode Island, it is private individuals who have made the difference for some of the best remaining waterfowl habitat in the state, in conjunction with The Nature Conservancy and State and Federal government agencies. We have a phased restoration in progress to rectify years of damage as a result of dredge spoil deposited along a tidal channel, poorly planned road construction, and a recent oil spill. In Phase I of the South Shore Habitat Protection project, Mr. Oliver Hazard donated an 80 acre tract of land to The Nature Conservancy valued at $900,000. In Phase II, William Viall donated 110 acres valued at $640,000 to the town of North Kingston. 
On the opposite side of the continent, it was a partnership among two State agencies, the Metropolitan Services District of Portland, several national and local conservation groups, and a local dairy farmer, E.F. Steinborn, who collaborated to restore 500 acress within the Tualatin River Floodplain near Portland, Oregon. The project converted a large dairy farm to seasonal and permanent wetlands providing habitat for thousands of waterfowl, shorebirds, and songbirds, complementing wetlands on the adjacent refuge. The project--located on the outskirts of Portland--is a wonderful example of how we can reclaim lands for conservation before they get swallowed up by urban expansion. 
Another example is an area in Swan Lake basin, located in a wildlife refuge in the San Joaquin valley of California. Swan Lake basin was a dry channeled area, but with NAWCA funds and four months of restoration work it has been transformed into a lake with free-flowing drainage. The area now provides nesting and resting groups for hundreds of white pelicans, as well as double-crested comorants, grebes, 8,000 canvasback ducks, 6,000 northern shovelers, and 40,000 gadwalls. 
The benefits of these partnerships go far beyond specific projects, however. They facilitate the flow of ideas 
and innovations across borders. Only in the last decade, for example, has Canada begun to use conservation easements and servitudes to protect land from development. Legislation within the provinces has been enacted to broaden the use of this valuable tool for conservation. It is without doubt that the partnerships under NAWCA have stimulated this awareness and can take part of the credit for these new developments in Canada. 
Here is a case where the United States, Canada and Mexico have come together to identify a common need. Consider just one NAWCA site in Quill Lake, Canada. Banding data reveal that waterfowl using that site have visited other NAWCA sites, represented by the blue circles, all across the continent. Imagine the synergies of all NAWCA projects helping each other. And, by enacting NAWCA, the United States has lead the way in providing a reliable funding structure to address it. We have been able to turn good international intentions into superlative international action. 
4. NAWCA leverages federal dollars with private funds for wetlands conservation. 
We all know how tight the federal budget is. Innovative funding mechanisms are the best hope for ensuring the viability of important environmental programs. The North American Wetlands Conservation Fund, which was established by NAWCA, provides grant money with a matching requirement to leverage each federal dollar. In fact, the ratio of NAWCA funds to contributions from other partners usually approaches 1:2. 
Now let me inject a word of caution. We cannot afford complacency. NAWCA has been a success, but part of the credit for the recovery of waterfowl species has to go to the heavy rains we've had in the past few years. This year is drier than it has been in the past. Already, duck counts are leveling off. In drier conditions, the need to conserve duck habitat is ever more urgent. 
And this urgent need to conserve wetlands is in direct competition with severe development pressures on wetlands. By the year 2020, more than half of the U.S. population will live in coastal plains. Laws like NAWCA will become ever more important in protecting these fragile areas. 
The proper tribute to the success of NAWCA is to let it inspire us to do more. Let us reauthorize this fine bill. Let us ensure it is adequately funded. Let us support the other important laws that protect wetlands--such as Swampbuster and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. And most of all, let us build on the strengths of NAWCA in all our environmental protection endeavors. Again, those strengths are: 
1. Focus on conserving habitat. 
2. Use a comprehensive plan--continent-wide, if possible. 
3. Rely on public-private partnerships--both national and international. 
4. Leverage federal dollars with private funds. 
I exhort my colleagues to support S. 1677, and reauthorize the very worthy North American Wetlands Conservation Act. I thank the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I introduced this bill last July on behalf of the administration. S. 2317 makes several changes to the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966. First, it removes three areas from the Refuge System that have lost the habitat value that led to their being incorporated into the Refuge System. Second, it changes the name of the Klamath Forest National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon to the Klamath Marsh National Wildlife Refuge. The current name leads visitors to believe that it is a national forest, causing confusion over what activities are permitted. 
Mr. President, although no one like to see areas removed from the Refuge System, the three areas in question have truly lost their original wildlife value. Thirty-seven acres within the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge has been developed for recreational purposes when it was leased to the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). The area in question would be transferred to the Corps, which owns the adjoining lands, and its recreational use would be continued. 
In 1934 an Executive order established the Killcohook Coordination Area as a migratory bird refuge as long as the Corps could continue to use the area as a dredge disposal site. Sixty years later this area is completely covered with piles of spoil and, not surprisingly, no remaining waterfowl habitat. This bill would eliminate the Fish and Wildlife Service's secondary jurisdiction. 
The final change will revoke an easement that allows the Fish and Wildlife Service to prohibit hunting of migratory birds at Lake Elsie, North Dakota. The easement was granted in 1939 and the surrounding land is privately owned and the State owns the lake. Due to substantial development, the area is no longer suitable for migratory birds.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, the Committee on Environment and Public works favorably reported out this bill last May. The area in question was correctly mapped as an undeveloped coastal barrier, but extraordinary miscommunication at the Federal, State and local levels failed to ensure that the appropriate maps were being provided to the public. As a result, when the landowner inquired from Colleton County about the status of his land with respect to the Coastal Barrier Resources System, he was given inaccurate information. The sole reason that we supported the changes made by Senator Hollings' bill was because of the unprecedented and unique procedural circumstances in this case, and we do not anticipate that there would be other instances that would warrant similar changes. The law only requires Coastal Barrier Resources System maps to be on file at the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and reporting this bill does not imply that landowners should rely on maps filed at any other location to determine whether or not their property is located within the Coastal Barrier Resources System.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering H.R. 1856, a bipartisan bill that has tremendous potential to improve management and operations of the National Wildlife Refuge System by supplementing scarce Federal dollars with outside services and donations by local groups and individuals. 
As budgets continue to shrink, the Federal Government must look for alternative sources of funding and assistance. Volunteers have helped the Refuge System since volunteer wardens staffed the very first refuge on Pelican Island, Florida in 1903. Since 1982, when the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) established a formal volunteer program, the program has grown from 4,251 volunteers donating 128,400 hours of time to 28,800 volunteers donating more than 1.5 million hours in 1997. This 1997 figure represents almost 20 percent of all work done by the FWS on the Refuge System, amounting to about $14 million worth of services, at a support cost of $780,000. 
The five refuges in my own state of Rhode Island, which are managed as a single complex, provide a wonderful illustration of how important these efforts are. With only five full-time employees working among the five Rhode Island refuges, volunteers contributed more than one-third of all work performed on these refuges. At several of our refuges, the typical visitor will interact with only volunteer staff. 
The `National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer and Community Partnership Enhancement Act' lends much needed support to the efforts of the Service to maintain and operate the Refuge System. Specifically, it establishes pilot projects for the Service to hire volunteer coordinators; it also authorizes the creation of a Senior Volunteer Corps, which is expected to be part of the Service's existing volunteer program, and for which the Secretary should explore coordination with National Senior Service Corps programs operated by the Corporation for the National Service. In addition to encouraging volunteer efforts within the System, the bill encourages financial contributions, community partnership initiatives, and educational programs to benefit the System. 
H.R. 1856 was introduced by Congressman Saxton on June 10, 1997, and subsequently passed by the House. On June 26, 1998, I introduced a similar bill, S. 2244, within 14 cosponsors. The Committee on Environment and Public Works amended the House-passed bill to conform with S. 2244, and I now ask that the Senate take up H.R. 1856 as amended. I have been pleased to work with Congressman Saxton on this wonderful initiative, and I urge expeditious approval by both the Senate and House, as well as by the President.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering S. 2094, the Fish and Wildlife Revenue Enhancement Act, a bill introduced by my colleague Senator Allard and cosponsored by me. This bill represents a move towards efficient use of government funds, and support for the valuable programs carried out by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service with those scarce funds. 
Each year, the Service receives thousands of items derived from fish, wildlife and plants, such as boots, purses and wallets, made from furs and skins. These items can be forfeited or abandoned during enforcement of Federal wildlife laws, and they are eventually shipped to the National Wildlife Property Repository in Colorado. The Repository currently has about 450,000 items, of which 200,000 can be legally sold. 
However, under current law, revenue from the sale of forfeited items go to the Service for certain program operations, while revenue from the sale of abandoned items go to the General Treasury. More than 90 percent of the fish and wildlife items are abandoned, so that the Service would receive very little revenue from sales of items in its Repository. 
The Repository was appropriated $310,000 for operations last year. After overhead and operations, only $30,000 was available for carrying out the programs that loan these items to schools, universities, museums, zoos for educational purposes, and to Native American groups for religious and ceremonial purposes. 
The bill would initially generate approximately $1 million for the Service through the sale of items derived from fish and wildlife that are currently stored by the Service. This money would be used to cover the costs of storing and disposing of these items--which is now a financial drain on the Service--and to fund the worthwhile programs benefiting education, research and Native American religious and ceremonial purposes. 
I would like to note that this bill does not change existing authority with respect to items that may be sold by the Service. Indeed, it clarifies that other laws prohibiting the sale of fish, plants or wildlife equally apply to this law. Specifically, current law prohibits the sale of items derived from threatened and endangered species, marine mammals, and migratory birds. 
In summary, I am pleased to cosponsor this bill with Senator Allard, and urge the Senate and House to approve it expeditiously.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, twice during this Congress, the Senate has debated reforming the manner in which campaign funds are raised and spent. A majority of Senators clearly believes that the current system is in need of reform. Progress has been made during this Congress in two important areas: in the substance of the issue and in gaining greater Congressional support for reform. 
It would be a shame to sully this bipartisan progress by resorting to political tactics, as too often has occurred in past debates. In 1992, both the House and the Senate approved a campaign reform bill that had no hope of becoming law. It was wholly unacceptable to President Bush, and he had no recourse but to veto it. In 1993 some of us worked hard with Members from the other side to craft serious legislation. But the Senate bill was not agreeable to House Democrats, and it languished in the House for months before any action occurred. As the election year adjournment neared, the Democratic leadership reached an agreement on what would be included in a conference report before the conferees had ever met, and that agreement was far from the reform that I had hoped for and supported. In 1996, another election year, a far less acceptable version of the McCain-Feingold bill was debated and defeated. 
This year, supporters of reform find themselves in a slightly more hopeful position. The bill before us has been greatly improved; it has bipartisan support; and the House has already approved very similar legislation. 
The paramount goal of any true effort to reform the system of financing elections for federal office must be to reduce the influence of special interest money on elected officials. Although the proposal before us may not be the final resolution to the problems that afflict the current system of campaign fundraising, it provides a better starting point than we have had in previous years. 
I urge my colleagues on this side of the aisle to take another look at the modified version of McCain-Feingold that is before us today. This is a solid proposal that addresses the soft money abuses that have effectively obliterated federal election law. It addresses the problem of unregulated, unrestricted, and unreported spending by anonymous donors. It addresses blatant electioneering disguised as issue advocacy. And it eliminates enormous soft money contributions from corporations and big donors. In other words, it goes a long way to reducing the influence of special interests. 
And I urge my colleagues on the other side not to let this debate degenerate into political gamesmanship.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, for the past year, the Majority Leader, Senator Bob Smith, and I have been working with our colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Administration to draft legislation to address some of the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (`RCRA') that currently impede the cleanup of literally thousands of contaminated sites across the nation. This so-called `RCRA rifle-shot' would have been an important piece of legislation. It would have demonstrated once again that we can improve our environmental laws, without jeopardizing human health or the environment, and reduce unnecessary costs. Just last year, the Government Accounting Office reported that eliminating those impediments to cleanup could save up to $2.1 billion per year and, at the same time, significantly expedite environmentally responsible cleanups. 
It was our hope to craft a bipartisan bill that could be enacted this year. Our goal was a shared one--to develop legislation to eliminate overly restrictive treatment standards for mediation waste, to streamline permitting requirements, and preserve existing State cleanup programs, all while still ensuring that human health and the environment are protected. Under Senator Lott's leadership, we worked hard to achieve that goal and I believe that we made significant progress in resolving our differences. Unfortunately, we were not able to reach a final agreement and we have essentially run out of time. 
I remain committed, however, to the goal of improving the remediation waste program. I continue to believe that this is an important issue and that with appropriate legislation we can achieve a significant environment benefit--cleaning up thousands of contaminate sites and saving billions of dollars. That is clearly a worthwhile goal. Therefore, I intend to make RCRA reform a priority for the Environment and Public Works Committee in the next Congress. Building on the progress that we have made this year, and with Senator Lott's continued leadership, it is my hope that we will move legislation through the Senate early in the next Congress.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the bill now before the Senate is the `John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Authorization Act.' 
The concept of a national Center for the performing arts originated during the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. President Eisenhower envisioned a national cultural center in the nation's capital, and in 1958, with the support of Congress, he signed into law the National Cultural Center Act, which established the Center as an independently administered bureau of the Smithsonian Institution. Following the death of President Kennedy, the Congress in 1964 renamed the Center in honor of the late president. 
The Kennedy Center was opened to the public in September 1971. The response was overwhelming--so much so that the Center's Board of Trustees requested help from Congress in maintaining and operating the Center, for the benefit of the millions of visitors. In 1972, Congress authorized the National Park Service to provide maintenance, security, and other services necessary to maintain the facility. For the next two decades, the Park Service received federal appropriations for the maintenance and operation of the Presidential monument. 
In the early part of this decade, however, it became clear that the Kennedy Center facility--which had not seen comprehensive capital repair since its opening--had deteriorated significantly due to both age and intensive public use. Those repairs that had taken place--such as the 1977 repair of the leaking roof--were undertaken in response to threatening conditions. The Board of Trustees, with the support of the Park Service, therefore set out to achieve a more effective long-term approach to management of the facility, with one entity responsible for both the care of the physical plant and the staging of performance activities. 
In 1994, therefore, Congress approved and the President signed the John F. Kennedy Center Act Amendments (Public Law 103-279). That Act authorized the transfer of all capital repair, operations, and maintenance of the Center from the Park Service to the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees. 
The Act also directed the Board to develop a comprehensive, multi-year plan for the restoration and ongoing maintenance of the Kennedy Center. In 1995, the Board delivered the Comprehensive Building Plan, which set forth a long-term, two-stage program for the remediation of substandard building conditions, as well as continuous maintenance for the future. Phase I, scheduled for Fiscal Years 1995 through 1998, has concluded successfully. During this time, several major projects were completed, including the installation of a new, energy-efficient heating and cooling system, replacement of the leaking roof and roof terrace, and the major renovation of the Concert Hall. Phase II is scheduled to take place over the next eleven fiscal years, through Fiscal Year 2009. This stage will involve the massive `Center Block' project, during which the Opera House will be overhauled, as well as projects to make improvements to the plaza, improve accessibility to the theaters, install fire and other safety technology, and make a host of other repairs designed to ensure that the facility meets life safety standards. 
That brings us to the legislation we are considering today. For the major Phase II projects to get underway, Congress must revise the 1994 Act to authorize appropriate funding for the next several fiscal years. This bill authorizes significant funding levels for the next eleven fiscal years for maintenance as well as capital repair work. 
The bill before the Senate is H.R. 3504, the House-passed bill. It is almost identical to S. 2038, legislation that I introduced and that was reported by the Environment and Public Works Committee on June 12, 1998. Because of the similarity in the two bills, we are pleased to pass the House bill without amendment sending it to the President for his signature. 
The Kennedy Center is a living Presidential memorial and a national monument, and as such demands a high standard of maintenance and upkeep. As an ex-officio member of the Board, and Chairman of the authorizing Committee, I am dedicated to the appropriate restoration and preservation of the facility, which millions of Americans have enjoyed for more than a quarter of a century.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Adoption Equality Act of 1998, legislation that will make it easier for children with special needs to find permanent, adoptive homes. I want to extend my sincere thanks to Senator Rockefeller for his commitment to this legislation and to foster and adoptive children generally. Senator Rockefeller joins me as an original cosponsor, as do Senators DeWine, Kerrey, Bond, Levin, Landrieu, Dorgan and Moynihan. 
Nationwide there are 500,000 children in foster care. In Rhode Island there are approximately 1,600 children in foster care. On average, these children will spend more than two years in out-of-home care before they are either returned home to their biological families or freed for adoption. 
The majority of the children who have been legally freed for adoption--95 percent--have special-needs, which in the world of child welfare means that they are children who are hard to place. They may be older children, they may be children in sibling groups that the state does not want to separate, they may have physical disabilities or mental or emotional problems, or they may belong to a minority group. 
The federal government provides an incentive to families wishing to open their homes to these children by offering some of them a monthly subsidy to help defray the cost of adopting these children. It is expensive to care for children, and even more expensive if the child has special needs. The monthly subsidy, which is less than the monthly payment for the child to be in foster care, is used to defray some of these additional costs. 
What makes no sense about the current system is that the federal government only makes these subsidies available to special-needs children who are being adopted whose biological families were poor. If the child is being adopted by a low-income family, but their biological family was not low-income, that child will not receive a federal adoption subsidy. 
This system makes no sense to me, and that is why we are introducing the Adoption Equality Act today. This measure would make all special-needs children eligible for a modest federal adoption subsidy, regardless of the income of their biological parents. The income of the prospective adoptive parents would be taken into account when calculating the amount of the subsidy, as it is under current law.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with Senators Bob Graham, Joe Lieberman, Arlen Specter and Max Baucus in introducing a bipartisan managed care reform bill--the Promoting Responsible Managed Care Act of 1998. 
In November 1997, a number of us formed the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Task Force on Health Care Quality to better understand the mounting public frustration over managed care. The task force heard from numerous consumer and provider groups, and received presentations from the sponsors of all of the major managed care reform bills now pending in Congress. The bill we are introducing today, the Promoting Responsible Managed Care Act of 1998, has benefited greatly from the efforts of the task force, and we wish to thank all participants, on both sides of the aisle, for their attentiveness and diligence. 
This legislation was developed in accordance with the following principles: 
Bipartisan legislation which can be enacted this year. 
Provides all Americans in privately insured health plans with basic federal protections. 
Meaningful enforcement which holds managed care plans accountable, and provides individuals harmed by such plans with just compensation. 
Report cards to enable consumers to make informed health care choices based on plan performance. 
As my colleagues well know, next month the Senate is headed for a polarized debate on managed care reform, which may well result in gridlock. Each party has put forward a plan which contains features unacceptable to the other side--such as exposing insurers to lawsuits in state court in the case of the Daschle plan, and the broad expansion of medical savings accounts (MSAs) in the case of the Nickles plan. 
It is for this very reason that we have put forward a bipartisan plan--one which blends the best features of both the Democratic and Republican plans, but omits the so-called poison pills. When it comes to restoring public confidence in managed care and ensuring a basic floor of federal patient protections, gridlock simply will not be an acceptable outcome. 
We believe Congress has the responsibility to step up to the plate in the remaining weeks of this session and to enact legislation which the President can sign into law to address the outstanding concerns Americans have about their managed care. Indeed, despite continuing opposition from the insurance industry to the enactment of any reform legislation, many of the managed care industry's own leaders have privately expressed concern about the future of managed care if legislative action is not taken soon to strengthen public confidence. 
In our estimation, given the hardened positions of both parties, the only way Congress can succeed in that endeavor this year is for a bipartisan centrist plan to emerge once it becomes clear that neither the Daschle or Nickles plan has the requisite support to cross the finish line. 
What we would like to do now is to take a few minutes to lay out the key components of our proposal. First, I will talk about the scope of the bill--a topic which you will be hearing a lot about in the coming weeks. Then, Senator Graham will outline our patient protection provisions, and Senator Lieberman will discuss the importance of arming consumers with meaningful Report Card information, and a credible enforcement regime to ensure that managed care plans play by the rules. 
In 1996, Congress passed significant reforms of the private health insurance marketplace with respect to the issue of portability. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, also known as the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, established a federal floor of portability protections for all 161 million privately insured Americans. 
We see no reason for narrowing the scope of the patient protections in this next and far more consequential area of reform. Thus, like the Daschle plan and the House-passed GOP bill, the Promoting Responsible Managed Care Act would apply to all privately insured Americans. 
This approach preserves state prerogatives to enact more stringent standards, while assuring a minimum floor of federal protections for all Americans in private health plans--whether those plans are regulated at the state or federal level. In contrast, the Senate Republican plan proposes to provide a more limited range of patient protections to a much narrower band of the American population--primarily those 48 million enrollees in self-funded ERISA plans. 
While it is true that individuals in these plans have fewer protections than those in state-regulated plans, that alone is insufficient reason for denying these basic quality improvements and safeguards to all 161 million Americans in privately insured managed care plans. Such a bifurcation would, in our judgment, create many unnecessary and inequitable circumstances for consumers, and exacerbate the already unlevel playing field which exists in the health insurance marketplace.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to clarify a point that was raised on the floor yesterday concerning an unfortunate event that occurred in my home State of Rhode Island almost a decade ago: the failure of the Rhode Island Share Deposit Insurance Corporation (RISDIC). Some Senators have suggested that the failure of RISDIC was triggered by credit unions getting overly involved in business lending. That is not entirely accurate. 
The credit unions did not trigger the RISDIC crisis. Instead, the collapse of the system can be traced to a substantial embezzlement from the Heritage Loan and Investment Corporation, a type of state-chartered bank. In fact, of all the credit unions that were closed in Rhode Island during that crisis, none was federally insured and none was either supervised or examined by federal regulators. Indeed, during that entire period of the so-called credit union crisis, those credit unions that were chartered, insured, supervised, and regulated by the federal government continued to perform flawlessly, despite the disastrous economic turmoil around them. 
So I just want to say again that the RISDIC crisis was not caused by credit unions. Rather, the credit unions were the unfortunate victims of a crisis brought about by embezzlement from a bank.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gregg. 
On page 93 of the report accompanying the FY99 Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary Appropriations Act (S. Rept. 105-235) is a provision appropriating $1 million for a data survey of Narragansett Bay, to be conducted in conjunction with the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC). I would like to outline to the chairman my understanding of the purpose of these funds, and request his concurrence. 
The $1 million appropriated for this project is to be used by CRMC for a Geographic Information System (GIS) software program to develop digital data on Narragansett Bay's resource conditions, availability and use. Advanced sonar technology would be employed to assess the Bay's bottom sediment types, habitat and use conflicts. A previous EPA study, the Narragansett Bay Critical Resource mapping project, was unable to collect data on bottom habitat, due to the limitations of research methods used at the time. 
The data collected by this project would provide CRMC with information that, combined with input from other sources, would be helpful in determining appropriate sites for aquaculture leases, a function currently hindered by inadequate data and ongoing disputes over use. The data would also be useful in making several other decisions related to marine management issues. In addition, the project is intended to provide for studies relating to questions regarding environmentally sound and economically sustainable forms of aquaculture by the University of Rhode Island's Partnership for the Coastal Environment. 
It is intended that the data collected and developed under this project not only be utilized by CRMC, but will also be made available to other Federal and State agencies as well as private fishery and conservation groups. I would like to briefly describe some of the entities that could potentially benefit from this data and ought to have access to it. 
First, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) could use the data to identify existing essential fish habitats (EFH) not only in Narragansett Bay, but also in nearby Rhode Island and Block Island sounds. In addition, the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation (RIEDC) ought to have access to the data in order to help establish suitable shipping lanes for larger vessels serving the cargo port at Quonset Point. Further, the data could be useful to NOAA's National Estuary Research Reserve NERR in selecting eelgrass restoration sites, identifying areas impacted by fishing gear, and areas suitable for habitat restoration. Finally, the data should be accessible to interested private fishery and conservation groups, such as the Rhode Island Shellfishermen's Association, the Ocean State Fisherman's Association and Save the Bay. 
Let me also point out what this project is not intended for. This initiative is not aimed at giving preference to one group or interest over another in the use of, or issuance of permits in, Narragansett Bay and other marine resources in Rhode Island. Instead, it is simply intended to provide State and Federal authorities with the best possible information to assist them in making the most responsible public policy decisions not just on aquaculture permitting, but also on a variety of matters involving our precious natural resources. 
I would ask Chairman Gregg if he concurs that the description I have provided on this funding is the Committee's intent?

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering H.R. 39, the African Elephant Conservation Reauthorization Act. The bill was introduced by Congressmen Young on January 7, 1997, favorably reported by the House Resources Committee on April 21, 1997, passed by the House the same day, and referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senator Jeffords introduced a companion bill, S. 627, on April 22, 1997. The Committee held a hearing on both bills on November 4, 1997, and favorably reported them on May 21, 1998. Today we take up the House passed bill to expedite Congressional action on this important legislation. 
The bill reauthorizes the African Elephant Conservation Act for four years, through 2002, at the current authorization level of $5 million annually. The current law was enacted in 1989, in response to a sharp decline in many populations of African elephants due primarily to poaching for ivory. Population estimates vary widely across its range, but the total population is estimated to have declined by as much as 50 percent, from 1.3 million elephants in the late 1970's, to less than 700,000 in 1987. The species continues to decline, with a population of about 540,000 elephants in 1996. 
The Act established a process for implementing strict ivory import controls, and established a dedicated fund for cooperative conservation projects in African countries. The Act has been tremendously effective in assisting in conservation efforts worldwide. Under the authority of the Act, President Bush established a moratorium on all ivory imports into the United States, which served as the impetus for the worldwide ban on trade in elephant parts and products, approved by the Parties to the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES) one year later. 
Through the Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service has funded 60 projects in 19 countries since 1990. The law has generated approximately $22 million for elephant conservation programs, of which $6.8 million has been provided by the U.S. Government, with $15.8 million from other sources. Indeed, the success of this law has led to similar laws for Asian elephants, rhinos and tigers. 
Again, I am pleased that the Senate is considering this legislation, and I hope that the President will sign it into law soon. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the Senator from Idaho and his remarks. 
He indicated that it was a `shocking'--if I am quoting him correctly--`shocking' event to punish the person whose weapon caused the damage; the person who is careless in the storage of that firearm under this legislation pays a penalty. The Senator from Idaho, as I understood him, thought that was a very strange procedure. 
I will say this, Mr. President. I think every one of us know that if you own a pit bull, and you don't keep that pit bull tied up properly, and it mauls some innocent child, that the owner of that pit bull is liable. We have a situation akin to that--not pit bulls, but dangerously loaded weapons that are carelessly strewn about someone's home. A youngster comes in and gets hold of them and uses it for destructive purposes. That person that owns that weapon ought to pay the penalty. The suggestion that this is something strange and unheard of strikes me in itself as being strange. 
Mr. President, we have seen, all of us, these horrible incidents that have taken place over the past year in schools where youngsters have obtained weapons frequently because the weapons are not properly stored. They are not properly locked up. They are left around not only carelessly, but they are loaded. 
Let's just review these, if we might. 
In October, a 16-year-old at Pearl High School in Mississippi went to school with a hunting rifle. He shot and killed a student and a teacher, leaving a second teacher with a bullet wound in the head. 
In December, a student at Heath High School in West Paducah, KY, used a pistol to kill three other students. 
I mean, this is what is happening in our schools. 
The shooter was 14 years old. 
In March, two boys in Jonesboro, AR, one 11 years old and the other 13 years old, pulled the fire alarm in their school. As students and teachers left the building, the two boys began shooting. They killed five people: Four young girls, and a teacher. 
In April, a 14-year-old boy in Edinboro, PA, went to a school dance with a gun he apparently removed from his father's bureau drawer. He killed a science teacher and injured two students and another teacher. 
At Thurston High School in Springfield, OR, a 15-year-old who was suspended for carrying a gun to school returned to 
school the next day and opened fire in a crowded cafeteria. He killed two students and wounded 19 others--19 others. He killed two, and wounded 19 others. Police suspect he shot and killed his parents as well. 
These are terrible, tragic shootings. 
According to Handgun Control, 91 percent of handguns involved in unintentional shootings come from the home where the shootings occur. 
Mr. President, this is a national disaster. There are 192 million firearms--192 million firearms--in the possession of private citizens in our Nation, and 35 percent of American homes contain at least one gun. 
Each year, more than 500 children accidentally shoot themselves or a sibling, a family member, with a family gun. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control, the firearms-related death rate for American children under the age of 15--I mean, I think it is important we realize what we are talking about here. These youngsters are under 15. The rate in the United States for the death rate of these children through guns is 12 times higher than that of the other 25 industrialized nations combined. 
One thing is certain. It is simply too easy for children to get a gun. At the very least, adults should be encouraged to store their guns in a manner and a place that is inaccessible to children. If they don't, and if the child uses the gun to harm himself or someone else, the adult should be held responsible. 
I find it hard to argue with that premise. As I say, if there is a pit bull, no one would argue a bit that the pit bull should be chained up. We have seen incidents--certainly, I have seen them in my State--where they are not chained and they maul some youngster terribly. The owner of that dog, that pit bull, is held responsible. And the owner of a gun that is far more dangerous than that pit bull should likewise be held responsible. 
Are we embarking on something radical here, something that is unacceptable by the public? 
In April, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll was taken--a bipartisan poll by Peter Hart and Bob Teeter, whom most of us know. We know Bob Teeter. We have worked with him. Others on the other side have worked with Peter Hart. 
This is the question:  
Congress is considering legislation that holds adults criminally responsible if they allow young children to have access to firearms that are used to injure or kill another person. Do you favor or oppose this legislation? 
That was the question. You are going to hold adults criminally responsible if young children have access to firearms that are used to injure or kill another. 
The answer was 75 percent said they favored this type of legislation; 21 percent said they opposed it, and 4 percent were undecided. 
It seems to me that it is time that we in Congress caught up with the American people on this issue. Here is an opportunity to encourage gun owners to act responsibly by keeping their weapons out of the reach of children. 
This amendment does not prevent anybody from owning a gun. That is a red herring, if anybody suggests that. It says if you are a gun owner who has reason to expect a child to be on the premises, you must store your gun safely. I don't think the National Rifle Association would object to that. Certainly, it seems to me, they would encourage people to store their weapons safely. If they failed to store them safely, and a child uses it to harm himself, or someone else, the gun owner can be held criminally liable. That makes total common sense to me. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this commonsense approach to gun safety. 
I thank my cosponsor who worked so hard on this, and I thank the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is clearly recognized that if you own a pit bull and it is recognized as dangerous, you better control that pit bull. And if that pit bull slips away and injures, severely mauls a child, you are liable. So it is with guns. If you leave a gun lying around that a juvenile gets to and that juvenile causes severe damage with that gun either to himself or to another individual, then you are to be liable, likewise. 
If you are liable for a pit bull, you certainly ought to be liable for a dangerous weapon like a rifle or a handgun that is left lying around. If you keep it under lock and key, that is a different matter, you are not liable. I urge everyone to support this amendment.

Mr. CHAFEE. I agree with the senior senator from Vermont that although the EPA Mercury Report does the best job so far in quantifying mercury emissions, many believe that the report understates the actual amount of mercury being released to the environment. Along with Senator Leahy, I voiced my concern when the release of the EPA Mercury Report was delayed. It is my understanding the EPA is taking a number of long-overdue steps to address mercury emissions. Toward the end of obtaining better data on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, we should begin collecting information from these facilities on the mercury that they emit. As Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I intend to hold hearings in September on the issues raised by the EPA Mercury Report and Senator Leahy's amendment in order to foster a broader public discussion from all concerned parties about the information and findings that are contained in the EPA Mercury Report.

Mr. CHAFEE. I agree with Senator Leahy. The American taxpayers have already spent over $1 million on the EPA Mercury Report. The Report does not need to be redone. I do not believe that anyone who actually reads it objectively would conclude that we need to study mercury all over again before Congress or EPA can make any decision about mercury emissions. But that is precisely what the House report language would require. This report language is an inappropriate use of the appropriations process.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, page 71 of the committee report accompanying the fiscal year 1999 VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill states that, `[n]one of the funds provided to the EPA are to be used to support activities related to implementation of the Kyoto Protocol prior to its ratification.' I want to try to get a clarification on this report language from the distinguished chairman of the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Subcommittee, Senator Bond. I would agree that the EPA should not use appropriated funds for the purpose of issuing regulations to implement the Kyoto Protocol, unless and until such treaty is ratified by the United States. 
I would like to point out, however, that the United States is a full participating signatory nation to the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change. Under the 1992 Framework Convention, which was agreed to in Rio de Janeiro by President Bush and later consented to by the U.S. Senate, the United States pledged to carry out a wide variety of voluntary initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. These initiatives, being implemented by the EPA, the Department of Energy, and other agencies, are in place today. The Congress has funded these initiatives for several years now, indeed, long before the December 1997 climate conference in Kyoto, Japan. These initiatives; the Climate Challenge program, the Program for a New Generation of Vehicles, Green Lights, Energy Star, and others, have to varying degrees reduced greenhouse gas emissions by increasing energy efficiency across a broad range of domestic industrial sectors. They make sense for other reasons, Madam President. We have found with these programs and others that our companies and American consumers benefit economically. When we conserve resources and reduce energy consumption in a sensible way, we save money. When we research, manufacture and market new energy efficient goods and services, we create export opportunities and jobs. We also increase U.S. energy security by reducing our dependence on imported oil, natural gas and coal. Finally, when we find cost effective ways to reduce greenhouse gases, we oftentimes reduce other air pollutants like mercury, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide. 
So, I want to make sure that the committee report language that I cited previously does not interfere with these important and worthwhile efforts. I would ask my friend from Missouri if these ongoing energy conservation and climate-related programs and initiatives, which are not intended to directly implement actions called for under the Kyoto Protocol, would go forward under this bill?

Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, I would be happy to. The DWSRF is to be used to assist pubiic water systems to finance infrastructure projects needed to comply with federal drinking water regulations. Public water systems that regularly serve at least 25 year-round residents or have a least 15 service connections qualify for assistance. The DWSRF may be used if it will significantly further the public health objectives of the Act. We recognize that there are a few communities that are currently serviced by wells that are contaminated, and the best way to solve the existing public health problems intended to be addressed by the Act may be to create a federally regulated public water system.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Lugar and others in offering this amendment today. The proposal seeks to establish a more balanced, deliberative U.S. policy as regards international sanctions. 
Today, nations throughout the world look to the United States for leadership. The end of the cold war has clearly left the United States as the sole remaining superpower. We are sought after for many reasons: Financial assistance, military might, political leadership, and the advocacy of democratic ideals. 
When the world looks to us for leadership on international sanctions, I am afraid that the administration and Congress have taken steps that increasingly have undermined our Government's reputation and influence abroad. The tendency--and it is particularly true with regard to Congress--to impose sweeping unilateral--that is, we do it alone--economic sanctions against nations whose behavior we disapprove of, I believe, is detrimental to our national interest and certainly has not succeeded in producing the results that we seek. 
Let us look at several recent examples. We have heard much about the situation with respect to Pakistan, in which the threat of tough, mandatory U.S. sanctions did nothing to dissuade the Pakistanis from testing nuclear weapons. The 30-year embargo on Cuba, has done nothing to hasten the end of the Castro regime or ease the suffering of the Cuban people. And just this year, we passed legislation to impose sanctions on entities suspected of assisting Iran's missile program. 
Moreover, when our sanctions have been structured to punish countries who continue to deal with the rogue nation we are trying to isolate, the outcome has been even murkier. All that these secondary sanctions end up doing is generating bad feeling among our allies about `American imperiousness,' and precipitating complaints from our trading partners to the World Trade Organization. As a result, the world's attention turns away from the rogue nation in question, and instead focuses on the United States and its actions. 
Mr. President, if Congress continues this habit of imposing, on an ad hoc basis, unilateral sanctions against any nation because of a form of behavior we find objectionable, our influence in the world will be diminished. While sanctions laws may feel good and bolster our sense of righteous indignation, sanctions imposed under these laws far too often do nothing more than antagonize nations and their peoples, and get us into trouble with our trading partners. Moreover, sanctions mean that our influence on the region in question drops sharply. And less U.S. influence means that the values we hold dear--democratic government, market economics and respect for human rights--will not be promoted worldwide. There must be a better way. 
I am an original cosponsor of S. 1413, the original Lugar bill to make wide-ranging reforms of our laws on unilateral sanctions. The amendment before us today, which is based on that legislation, would establish procedural guidelines and informational requirements before any further unilateral sanctions are imposed. It also provides for enhanced consultation between the executive and legislative branches of government prior to the imposition of sanctions. Finally, it mandates a two-year sunset for such sanctions, unless Congress specifically chooses to renew them. 
This amendment does not preclude Congress or the President from taking action necessary to achieve vital national security and trade objectives. However, it does ensure that such measures first will be considered in a thoughtful and responsible manner, and that we at least will have some idea as to whether these policies may actually achieve their intended goals. Thus, I urge my colleagues to support the Lugar amendment. 
I do want to stress that I think it is a great mistake for us to embark on these unilateral sanctions as freely as we do. This amendment, I believe, is a good one. Furthermore, it says that if we do impose sanctions, that there is to be a sunset provision. That sunset provision goes into effect after 2 years, unless, of course, Congress chooses to renew the sanctions. 
This amendment does not preclude Congress or the United States from taking action necessary to achieve vital national security or trade objectives, but it does assure that such measures are, first, very carefully considered in a responsible manner and that we at least have some idea as to whether the policies may actually achieve their stated goal.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President I am pleased to be here today with my distinguished colleagues to offer my support for the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998. This bipartisan legislation addresses one of the most important global environmental issues today--the protection and preservation of tropical rain forests. 
Since 1950 the world has lost as much as half of its tropical forests, and the destruction is continuing unabated. The most comprehensive survey of global deforestation estimated that, last year alone, we lost more than 30 million acres of tropical rain forest--an area the size of the State of Washington. This is a devastating loss because of the potential biological impacts deforestation can have both regionally and globally. 
Tropical forests contain the world's richest stores of biological diversity, and their health is essential for life on Earth. Scientists estimate that more than 50 percent of the Earth's terrestrial biological diversity is contained within these forests, which account for less than 2 percent of the planet's land surface. Almost 40 percent of all terrestrial plants and at least 25 percent of terrestrial vertebrate species are endemic to these areas. Many of these species are found only in a small area of the forests. And as the forests are destroyed, Mr. President, the species are permanently lost through extinction. 
Tropical forests also function as carbon `sinks,' storing greenhouse gasses that could otherwise contribute to global climate change. While there are still many scientific uncertainties related to climate change, it is undeniable that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are rising rapidly. A significant number of scientists believe that humans have already influenced our global climate. In order to lessen the risks associated with this change, such as sea level rise, extreme weather conditions, and higher average temperatures, it is important that the United States join with other nations to take preventative action. Protecting our tropical rain forests, and thus preserving their vital function of reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is one such action. 
Many of the world's tropical forests are located in developing countries that, since the international debt crisis of the 1970s, have been unable to repay loans to foreign lenders. These countries are in need of hard currency, and to come up with cash, they have resorted to exploiting their natural resources with little regard for environmental planning. Vast areas of tropical forests are destroyed each year for logging, agriculture and livestock operations. This trend will continue as debt continues to mount. 
Mr. President, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act will help turn the tide against this deforestation. This legislation builds upon President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, or EAI. EAI created a system by which Latin American and Carribean governments could restructure some of their official debt to the United States, while channeling local currency into funds to support environmental and child development programs. 
Using so-called `debt-for-nature swaps,' EAI restructured bilateral debt to provide $154 million to environmental trust funds in Latin America. Under these swaps, a nation's debt is modified, rescheduled, or written off, in return for the borrower nation's commitment of its own currency towards local conservation. The legislation before us today would extend the debt-for-nature mechanism of the EAI to the protection of significant tropical forests in lower and middle income countries throughout the world, not just those in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
The Tropical Forest Conservation Act will authorize $325 million over three years to be used for debt-for-nature swaps with developing countries that have forests with the greatest biodiversity and the highest risk of threat. S. 1758 assists countries with tropical forests that are globally outstanding in terms of their biodiversity, and applies to any lesser developed country with tropical forests and qualified U.S. debt. The authorized amount would be used to compensate the Treasury Department for any revenues lost due to the restructuring of outstanding debt. 
The legislation gives the President authority to reduce debt owed to the United States as a result of any credit extended through specific loan programs. In exchange, the developing countries would establish funds in their local currency to preserve and restore tropical forests. To ensure accountability, funds shall be administered and overseen by U.S. Government officials, environmental nongovernmental organizations active in the beneficiary country, and scientific or academic organizations. 
To qualify for assistance, countries must meet the criteria established by Congress under EAI, including that the government must be democratically elected, has not provided support for acts of international terrorism, is not failing to cooperate on international narcotics control matters, and does not participate in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. 
Mr. President, I believe this is an important bill that will go a long way in helping protect some of the world's most ecologically sensitive and vital areas. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act promotes debt reduction, investment reforms, community based conservation and sustainable use of the environment. In addition, it stretches limited Federal dollars making an effective use of international environmental assistance. I urge my colleagues here in the Senate to support S. 1758.

Mr. CHAFEE. Thank you very much, Madam President. 
I want to thank the distinguished senior Senator from Vermont for permitting me to proceed. 
Madam President, I oppose the motion to proceed to consider S. 2271, the so-called Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998. I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture. Quite simply, S. 2271 is a bad bill and we should not be spending any further time on this legislation, in my judgment. 
The bill would put Federal courts in the position of second-guessing local land management decisions. It would make it significantly more difficult for State and local governments to implement zoning restrictions, preserve neighborhoods, or protect environmentally sensitive areas. 
Madam President, this bill is opposed by virtually every national organization representing State and local governments--the National Governors' Association, the National Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, the Conference of Mayors, the National Conference of State Legislatures, amongst others. 
The Nation's largest environmental groups are also strongly opposed to this legislation. I might say, Madam President, if anybody wonders whether this is an environmental vote, it is. And I know that many around here say that the environmentalists are not very fair in their scoring. Well, here they have given clear notice that this is an item that resonates deeply with them. They are strongly opposed to this legislation, the environmental groups. 
The administration is strongly opposed. The Attorney General and the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the EPA and the Chairwoman of the Council on Environmental Quality--all of them oppose this. 
Madam President, I do not know whether these letters have been put in the Record previously, but I would just like to read, if I might--I wish the Senator from Utah were here, but perhaps he will be back. But I am going to just read, if I might, a couple of these letters. 
This is from the National Governors' Association, the National Association of Counties, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the National League of Cities, the United States Conference of Mayors. This is dated July 10, 1998. This isn't some old letter we dragged out; this is dated July 10--3 days ago. 
To all Senators: On behalf of the nation's governors, state legislators, and local elected officials, we are writing to express our strong opposition to S. 2271, the `Private Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998.' We believe the proposed legislation, including the proposed technical amendments, would fundamentally interfere with and preempt the traditional and historic rights and responsibilities of state and local governments and would mandate significant new unfunded costs for all state and local taxpayers. 
State and local elected officials are as deeply committed to protecting private property rights as are members of Congress. A review of the most recent proposed revisions to the legislation-- 
Your legislation, I say to Senator Hatch. I thought you might be interested in what the Governors and others have to say about it. They say your most recent revisions: . . . do not address our fundamental problems with the bill. We continue to believe that S. 2271 goes far beyond its stated objectives. 
If passed, the bill would undermine state and local government authority over land use and regulatory decisions by allowing developers and property owners to take their grievances directly to federal court, circumventing legal remedies on the state and local level. Such an `end run' around the processes established by our state law runs counter to the foundations of federalism . . . The bill preempts the traditional systems for resolving local zoning, land use, and regulatory disputes; it creates a disincentive for developers to negotiate with localities in order to reach mutually agreeable solutions; and it puts federal judges . . . 
Imagine this: the Federal Government, Federal judges, the very group we are so warned about frequently on this floor. And what is more, they are labeled frequently as activist Federal judges. 
Suddenly we are putting them in charge. I am shocked by this.

Mr. CHAFEE. Let me finish, if I might. 
I have here a letter, dated July 10, as I was saying just before the Senator from Utah came in. This is not some musty letter I dragged out of the files from a couple of years ago. This was written 3 days ago. 
In it, it says: 
We believe the proposed legislation, including the proposed technical amendments [i.e. those you have been referring to] would fundamentally interfere with the preemptive traditional and historic rights. 
And who signed it? Well, the Governor George Voinovich, chairman, National Governors' Association; Richard Finan, president, Ohio State Senate and president, National Conference of State Legislatures; Randy Johnson, president, National Association of Counties; Councilmember Brian O'Neill of Philadelphia, president, National League of Cities; and then, of course the mayor of Salt Lake City. Here is her signature, Deedee Corradini. 
I am sure she is a very able, intelligent, and fine lady, and an excellent administrator. So she directs this to all Senators. I am sure the Senator has received a copy. 
Now, Madam President, let me just say this. In each of our cities and each of our States, we have a system for resolving zoning problems, for example. The way it works in my State--it might be entirely different in the State of the Presiding Officer or the State of the principal proponent of this legislation--if my property is zoned residential and I want to put a gas station next to my house and I think that would be a real winner, I could make a lot of money from that gas station--now it is true that 30 other houses on the plat might not like it, but I like it, so I go before, in our State, I go before the zoning board of review. I go before the zoning board. I would seek a variance. I presume I might well be turned down. Then I go to the zoning board of appeals. In other words, I take the second step. 
Now, under this legislation, if I took that first step before the zoning board and was turned down and then I went to the zoning board of appeals, I wouldn't even have to wait for a decision. All I have to do is go before that, take that second step--in other words, one appeal--and then I can say, `This is taking too long,' and `I want to go into the Federal court,' and I can go into the Federal court. Then the Federal court, under this legislation, takes up the matter. 
I just don't think that is what we want. So many times on the floor of this Senate we inveigh, all of us have, against one size fits all. Yet that is exactly what we are doing here. We are saying, no, no, no, we don't like your system that you have in Maine, in Bangor, the way they are handling these appeals. 
We will let that person go into that Federal court and there is no incentive to negotiate, to come up with a compromise. When it is done on a city level or town level, as it is in my State, having the zoning board say, can't you people work this out, a gas station, that sounds like a little much, but talk with your neighbors and see what they say. Perhaps in some other area you can work this out, but we want to negotiate. 
That is not true when you get this thing in the Federal court. They then come down with a decision and they direct the zoning board--issue a permit for such and such. Is that really what we want? 
I find this an astonishing proposal. I certainly hope that we are not going to get in this situation where powers that--200 years, these powers have resided in the local communities. Because somebody said, `Oh, they take too long, we don't like those long delays, so we are going to make it so you can go into the Federal court.' Well, apparently the people who live there don't think it is taking too long or they would change it. We are not helpless in our local communities, and wherever one is, whether it is each Greenwich, RI, or Ellsworth, ME, the people don't like the situation, they can change it. That is perfectly possible. 
What the law is saying, we don't like the way you are doing things down there, you are taking too long, so we will have those activist Federal judges that we have heard Senators on the floor inveigh against so often--I certainly hope that this cloture will not be invoked on this matter. 
I might say, this issue isn't whether private property owners should be protected or whether private property owners are entitled to just compensation if their property is taken for public use. The fifth amendment already provides for that. You can get into the Federal court under the present system. You don't need this legislation. You have to permit the case to ripen. That is what the courts have been saying. In other words, exhaust your remedies on the local level before you can go into the Federal courts. 
I greatly hope, as I said before, that for the sake of the locals and those who believe that powers should be at the local level, that a system that has been in place for the past 200 years is not arbitrarily changed as is proposed by this legislation here. I thank the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there has been considerable discussion this afternoon about compensation and takings and so forth, but what this really is all about is, are we going to permit the local authorities to have the powers that they have had in the past to deal with local zoning matters and matters similarly associated therewith. 
What the proponents of this legislation are saying is that we don't want that, we don't want to have a situation whereby you must exhaust your local remedies. Even though that is recognized to apply in the fourth amendment where we are dealing with unlawful searches and seizures, for example--and there the courts have said you have to exhaust your local remedies--here is what they are also saying in connection with these so-called property rights under the fifth amendment. 
For some peculiar reason that I haven't quite been able to fathom here, those people who have long been stalwarts of the local authority and the powers of the locals--local elected officials, for example--are suddenly saying, `No, no, no, you don't know how to do this; we're a lot smarter than you are; we're Federal officials, we live inside the beltway, this is where we make our decisions and we're going to tell you how to run these matters on your local level.' 
Even though the Supreme Court recognizes that, yes, there can be no taking of private property without just compensation, they are saying that, first, you must exhaust your local remedies, you must let this what they call `ripen.' We have gotten adjusted to that. For over 200 years, this is the way this system has worked. But, `No, no,' say the proponents of this legislation, `that's not fast enough. Your local officials really don't know how to do this. What they are doing is they are holding up matters too long.' 
It is true that you, the local voters, for example, from your town or your city, your county, wherever it might be, you are tolerant of this, you are satisfied with the way the system works. 
But we are in Washington, DC. And we say, `No, we don't like that. We're going to change it for you. And, yes, your mayors can come to us and your Governors can come to us and your local legislators. We're going to dismiss you. We don't care what you want, we're going to tell you how to do this. We're pretty smart here in the U.S. Government, and we're going to straighten this thing out. No, we don't have to bother having any hearings. We'll tinker with this and change it all around and bring it to the floor. That's all right.' 
As the senior Senator from Vermont has pointed out, there has not been 30 seconds of hearings on this bill we have before us, but they say that is all right because we are all very, very smart around here and we know what is best. And so we are saying to the president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the president of the National Association of Counties, the president of the National League of Cities, and the vice chairman of the National Conference of State Legislatures, and so forth, this is the way we are going to do it. 
We are going to say, `You don't have to exhaust your remedies.' All you have to do in my State--I am not familiar how it works in every State; I know how it works in my State--if you want to make a dramatic change in zoning where you live, you want to put a multifamily structure up in a single family development, you say, `I'm going to go to the zoning board.' And you ask permission for this. And if the zoning board says no, then you file with the zoning board of review. And that is all you have to do. You do not have to do anything else. 
You do not have to go through that. And you do not have to take the steps and go to the State district court. Bang, you can go into Federal court. And there some federally appointed judge is going to tell you just how to straighten this thing out. He is going to tell you what to do, not your local officials, not your elected members of the zoning board or the zoning board of review. Not your mayor--he has nothing to do with this. It is going to be a federally appointed judge. And we have heard all --I do not know how many times on this floor we have heard about the dangers of activist Federal judges. And so we are going to have an activist Federal judge tell us what to do in East Greenwich, RI, or wherever it might be. 
Mr. President, I do not think that is right. I can see why they avoided having a hearing on this final bill, because it would have been trash. And it came out on practically a straight party-line vote. It indicates the lack of support for this legislation. 
Mr. President, I want to make one more point. When we have these things come up, a zoning request on the local level, there is great effort made to compromise it, to negotiate it in some fashion. `All right. You want to fill in a wetland? No, you can't fill in that wetland. There's a place where you can work out a situation, restore a wetland just right up the road. And this is the way we will work it out.' 
That is what local officials do. They know they are living there. They are dealing with their neighbors and people they know. They are not some Federal judge from some distant place who comes into town riding the circuit every now and then and says, `This is the way it's going to be.' But the problem is, you do not have that negotiation, that attempt to compromise, that attempt to work these matters out. 
I also might say, this has a very, very chilling effect on the local officials, because if the local officials are in a situation where they know they can be jerked into the Federal court--they make a decision on whether it is the preservation of a wetland or the preservation of the zoning, the one-acre zoning, whatever it might be--they are going to be very leery of making a decision against the wishes of the home builders, for example. 
Why are the home builders so enthusiastic about this legislation? Are they trying to preserve the environment or preserve some open space or do what is best for the community? Well, it is totally understandable. They are looking after their own interests. That is what they want. So, Mr. President, they are going to be going right into the Federal court. They have plenty of money. 
If I come from a relatively small town, and my little town is jerked into the Federal court--and we have a city solicitor--the town solicitor, who isn't paid much, if he is going to start going to Federal court and have to answer to every request for a change in the zoning, it is going to be a big bill that he is going to submit to this town. 
Mr. President, I certainly hope that this so-called Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998, which is going to come before us in a half an hour on a question of cloture--I certainly hope that everybody will vote against cloture. 
I thank the distinguished Senator from Washington for letting me speak.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, at the proper time I will move to table the appeal of the distinguished Senator from the State of Washington, but I want to let people debate on this. Obviously, a motion to table is not debatable, so I am not going to raise the motion to table until everybody has had a chance to have his or her say here. 
Mr. President, I would make a correction, if I might, to what I understood the Senator from Washington was saying. She seemed to indicate that this technical corrections measure that is included within the IRS reform--she indicates it takes $17 billion from veterans. I argue, of course, whether there is any taking from veterans at all, period. But the important point is that the technical corrections measure is strictly a technical corrections measure. The $17 billion that the Senator from Washington is referring to was a provision that was in the conference report on H.R. 2400--in other words, the conference report on the transportation legislation which I like to call ISTEA II. 
That was adopted by the Senate here, 88 to 5. That is where we handled that particular measure. Then we came to the technical corrections, and there, those technical corrections indeed do deal strictly with technicalities. 
As perhaps some will recall, we finished that bill on a Thursday evening; we finished the negotiations with the House of Representatives. Everybody was anxious to get off on the Memorial Day recess, and the staff and all worked all night long and came forward with the so-called H.R. 2400, the ISTEA II, if you would, on Friday, the day after we negotiated late into the evening. 
There we voted on the printed version, which was, to the best of our ability, correct. But there were technical mistakes in it. At the time, we recognized that there would be. But there is nothing, no technical mistake about the money that, through a general counsel's opinion, had been going to the veterans. That was taken care of, in the legislation that we voted on, on that Friday. And this technical corrections measure has nothing to do with that. 
So I am not quite sure why the distinguished Senator from Washington refers to this technical correction measure as taking $17 billion from veterans. It just plain does not do that. We believe that the technical corrections that are included in the IRS reform bill are strictly technical and noncontroversial. 
By the way, I didn't flesh out the part about what a monstrous job this was, not only finishing it on that Thursday evening, the negotiations and voting on the bill, but it is a 900-page bill. It presented tremendous challenges, and inevitably some errors were made. 
This technical corrections bill which has been developed jointly by us--the Senate and the House conferees, with some input from the U.S. Department of Transportation--is truly a technical corrections measure. It doesn't do anything with formula allocations. 
It is true that this veterans thing gets very, very confusing. The general counsel of the Veterans' Administration came forward with a decision that would have greatly enlarged the benefits that were available to those who had smoking-related illnesses. 
By the way, that never truly went into effect. There were some who made applications for grants or benefits under it. But to the best of my knowledge, I don't believe anybody actually received benefits. Their requests were being considered. 
The administration itself realized that this went way beyond anything they were intending, and the administration itself pulled back from that general counsel's decision and reversed it. We--that is the Senate of the United States, the Congress--went along with that reversal and used those funds that would otherwise have been available for general purposes for this transportation legislation. 
Mr. President, I think it is a mistake to suggest that this technical corrections measure is anything other than what it is labeled, a technical corrections measure that covers some of the problems that were raised as a result of the haste that we were under with this massive legislation when we were trying to recess for the Memorial Day recess. 
I don't know whether there is further debate to take place on this. I am not trying to cut people off peremptorily. If the Senator from Washington has further comments, I will give her an opportunity to speak if she wishes. 
Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator from New Mexico is absolutely correct: Set aside the big expansion of the program that took place as a result of the general counsel's opinion. Set that aside. There were some veterans receiving benefits under other programs that were related to smoking disability problems that occurred while they were on active duty. 
Inadvertently, the language in the original legislation--that is the ISTEA conference report--eliminated some of those benefits. This technical corrections bill that we have before us will straighten that out and restore those benefits. In an odd way, should the Senator from Washington prevail and this technical corrections measure be eliminated in some fashion, it will result in a failure to cure a problem that has arisen inadvertently.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I do want to stress, once again, as I said before, that killing the technical corrections bill is not going to restore any $17 billion. The technical corrections bill has nothing to do with that. It does not mention it, does not involve it at all. That was all taken care of in the conference report. 
Indeed, we voted three times on that measure. We voted on the whole matter of the $17 billion being used in connection with the ISTEA II legislation. We voted on it twice in connection with the budget, and we voted on it once when we did the conference report here. 
So, Mr. President, I do want to stress that should Senator Murray's appeal of the ruling of the Chair be successful, the entire IRS reform bill would effectively die. And so I urge my colleagues to uphold the ruling of the Chair. 
I now move to table Senator Murray's appeal of the ruling of the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, the conference report before the Senate includes the TEA 21, that is the Transportation Efficiency Act of the 21st century, which some call the ISTEA II Restoration Act. It includes a technical corrections measure to that bill. The technical correction measure, which is part of the legislation before us, remedies errors made in H.R. 2400, which was the surface transportation bill we passed just before the Memorial Day recess. 
As everyone knows, just before we went out on that break for Memorial Day, there was a great desire to complete the legislation before us. We completed negotiations on Thursday evening and delivered a very complex bill that had over 900 pages the first thing on Friday morning. In other words, we completed the negotiations on Thursday night, and by the next morning we had a bill of over 900 pages before us. Inevitably, some errors were made. 
We have before us legislation to correct those errors. I emphasize this is just a technical corrections bill. Many Members have come to us in the ensuing days suggesting new items or changes that they wanted to be made because they felt in the original legislation they did not obtain them. But we resisted all such requests. This bill merely carries out the agreements of that conference on H.R. 2400. I will refer to it sometimes by the number. That is the original transportation legislation that we passed. 
The technical corrections in the legislation before us have been developed jointly by the House and the Senate conferees, with valuable input from the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
I think it is important to note this legislation before us does not change the formula allocations agreed to in the conference. The technical changes in this legislation relate to apportionments. Those that exist are made to ensure that the legislative instructions to the Department of Transportation on the formula will produce an apportionment to the States just as we agreed upon. In other words, the only changes we made in this legislation, so-called technical corrections, are to take care of things that were left out inadvertently or to clarify an intent that was there and clearly recognized in order to carry out that intent. 
This bill also corrects drafting errors relating to veterans' smoking-related disability benefits. This is to what the Senator from West Virginia was referring. The provisions of H.R. 2400 were intended merely to reverse a recent decision by the general counsel of the Veterans' Administration, which decision had not yet been implemented. It is very important to remember that. We have been advised that the bill may be interpreted to deny benefits to some veterans who were eligible for benefits prior to the general counsel's decision. In other words, it has come to our attention there may be situations that have arisen that, as a result of the language as we drew it, denied benefits to some veterans who were receiving them. What we meant to do was to reverse the general counsel's decision as it might apply to future applicants in an entirely new category of benefits opened by the general counsel. And with this technical corrections bill, we reach that objective. 
There was an article in the Washington Post several weeks ago that has caused serious concern. That article suggested that Congress had declared smoking `willful misconduct' by America's veterans. That was just plain wrong. That statement in the Washington Post, that we included smoking as `willful misconduct' by American veterans, gave great offense to some. I want everyone to know that was an incorrect reading of the legislation. 
Section 1110 of title 38, which is the existing law and has nothing to do with the transportation legislation, entitled veterans to compensation if they are disabled by service-related illness or injury. There are two exceptions to this entitlement in current law. The first exception is `willful misconduct.' A veteran cannot get disability compensation if the illness or injury results from willful misconduct. That is the law. It has been the law a long time. The second exception denies benefits if the illness or injury resulted from alcohol or drugs. These two exceptions are in the current law. That is where they are. 
Now, H.R. 2400, the transportation legislation, added a third exception. It would have denied benefits where the illness results from smoking. This did not make smoking willful misconduct. This was a third exception to the provision that entitles a veteran to disability benefits. The first was willful misconduct, the second was alcohol or drugs, and the third was smoking related. 
From where did we get that language? That was suggested by the Senate legislative counsel as the most straightforward means to reverse the great opening of benefits under the general counsel's decision. 
This language had the unintended consequence of denying benefits to some veterans who would have qualified prior to the decision. This bill drops the language suggested by the Senate legislative counsel. We just got away from all that language that we had in there and returned to the language which was suggested by the administration, which reverses the general counsel's decision as it might apply to future applicants. 
No veteran now entitled to benefits as a result of adjudication, or who has applied for such benefits, will be affected. 
This bill makes the following changes to the veterans subtitle: 
One, it clarifies that veterans who file claims for smoking-related benefits are grandfathered. That filing isn't going to be eliminated. 
Second, it makes clear that those active-duty service personnel who contracted a smoking-related illness while in the service continue to qualify for disability compensation. We don't change that. 
Third, we ensure that survivors and their dependents will receive a 20-percent increase in education assistance benefits.

In addition to the appropriation to the National Rural Water Association, the Committee notes that `States are authorized to set aside 2 percent of the funds provided under their drinking water State revolving fund allotment.' 
I ask my friend from Missouri if he and other members of the Appropriations Committee are implying that the 2 percent set aside authorized in Section 1452(g)(2) of the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 is to be used for grants made to the National Rural Water Association and various regional community action organizations?

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators Bond and Mikulski for including a provision in the manager's amendment that makes it explicit that State Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund programs may continue the practice of collecting a loan service fee to help cover the cost of administering the loans and managing the revolving loan fund. 
Mr. President, there are approximately fourteen States that charge a loan administration fee to revolving loan fund borrowers to cover some of the costs associated with the loan transaction. As a service to the borrower, most of the States roll this fee into the loan so that it is repaid with interest over the duration of the loan. This is a tremendous help to the borrower, who is often unable to pay the fee upfront. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently objected to this practice despite the fact that it has been used since the inception of the revolving loan fund. EPA contends that this practice violates the four percent limitation on administrative fees in Title VI of the Clean Water Act. 
The language included in the manager's amendment will resolve this problem by allowing States to charge administrative fees regardless of whether they exceed the four percent limitation. To ensure that this practice is not abused, the fees cannot exceed an amount the Administrator of EPA deems reasonable. 
Mr. President, without this amendment many of the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund programs would face severe financial hardship that would be detrimental to the health of the revolving loan fund program. 
Once again, I would like to thank Senators Bond and Mikulski for including this very important amendment in their manager's package.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to introduce a bill that has tremendous potential to improve management and operations of the National Wildlife Refuge System. This bill--the National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer and Partnership Enhancement Act-- will supplement scarce Federal dollars with outside services and donations by local groups and individuals. I am joined by 13 of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including Senators Kempthorne, Baucus, Allard, Daschle, Collins, Graham, Feinstein, Jeffords, Gordon Smith, D'Amato, DeWine, Bond, and Faircloth. 
The National Wildlife Refuge System consists of 93 million acres in 513 units. This is the land set aside by the Federal Government to protect fish and wildlife. The Refuge System historically has received less funding acre-for acre than its larger and older sibling, the National Park System. Despite the recent passage of the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, the refuge system remains poorly funded, and has a significant backlog of construction and maintenance projects totaling approximately $1 billion. 
As budgets continue to shrink, the Federal Government must look at alternative sources of funding and assistance. Volunteer services have long helped the Refuge System, and are becoming increasingly important as a means of supplement decreasing Federal dollars. Indeed, the very first refuge on Pelican Island, Florida, was staffed by volunteer wardens. Since 1982, when the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) established a formal volunteer program, the program has grown from 4,251 volunteers donating 128,440 hours of time to 25,000 volunteers donating more than one million hours in 1996. This 1996 figure represents almost 20 percent of all work done by the FWS on the Refuge System, amounting to about $11 million worth of services, compared with a cost of $1.7 million for maintaining the volunteer program. 
The five refuges in my own state of Rhode Island, which are managed as a single complex, provide a wonderful illustration of how important these effort are. Last year, volunteers donated 4,500 hours of service to Rhode Islands refuges. With only five full-time employers working among the five Rhode Island refuges, volunteers contributed 36 percent of all work performed on these refuges. At several of our refuges, the typical visitor often will only interact with volunteer staff. 
The `National Wildlife Refuge System Vounterer and Partnership Enhancement Act' lends must needed support to the efforts of the FWS to maintain and operate the Refuge System. This bill will accomplish four goals: (1) encourage financial contributions and donations to refuges; (2) increase opportunities and incentives for volunteers on refuges; (3) promote community partnerships with local refuges; and (4) establish a refuge education program to use refuges as `outdoor classrooms.' 
Mr. President, let me give you some of the highlights in the bill. Section 3 of the bill allows gifts and donations to be made to individual refuges without further appropriations. While this is similar to current law, the bill provides new authority for the FWS to match these gifts. This will allow refuge managers to leverage the precious few dollars over which they have discretion for operations and maintenance with money from local residents and groups. 
Section 4 directs the FWS to carry out a pilot project at 2 or more refuges in each region, but no more than 20 nationwide, to hire a volunteer coordinator for the refuge. This coordinator will manage and supervise the volunteers, and service as the liaison between the volunteers, the partnership organizations, and the refuge. It also establishes a Senior Volunteer Corps for individuals 50 years or older. These older citizens comprise the majority of volunteer efforts throughout the refuge system. This new Corps will recognize and foster that effort. 
Section 5 provides for community partner organizations to enter into agreements with the FWS to implement projects consistent with the purposes of the refuge. The projects may improve habitat, support operations, promote educational materials, or encourage donations. Non-Federal funding may be matched by the FWS. Section 6 directs the Secretary of the Interior to develop guidance for education programs that promotes understanding of refuge resources, improves scientific literacy, and provides outdoor classroom experiences. It also authorizes the Secretary to develop or enhance refuge education programs based on this guidance. 
This bill is similar to a House bill, H.R. 1856, introduced by Congressman Saxton on June 10, 1997, and subsequently passed by the House. I have been pleased to work with Congressman Saxton on this wonderful initiative, and I urge all of our colleagues to support it.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I support Senator Kempthorne and will vote to table the Reid amendment. Senator Kempthorne's provision will protect the environment while providing the Air Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base with more realistic training facilities. 
Please note this: The administration supports the compromise in the bill. In fact, the administration wrote the language offered by Senator Kempthorne. Secretary Babbitt and Secretary Cohen have both sent letters of support, as has the Acting Secretary of the Air Force. 
The compromise language ensures that our environmental laws will fully apply to Air Force activities at the Juniper Butte Range. This includes the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act. 
The concessions made by the Air Force with respect to airspace flight restrictions near the range will reduce the noise in the canyon. Instead of flights at 100 feet at any time, the flights are now restricted to 3 days per week and this raises the minimum altitudes from 100 feet to 1000 feet or 5,000 feet depending on the flight angle to the canyon. 
The Kempthorne amendment provision protects the environment and national security. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Kempthorne.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Baucus, Hatch, D'Amato, Conrad, Mikulski, Jeffords and Rockefeller. I am introducing legislation that extends the current Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) program for three years. The program expires at the end of this month. While it is clear that the program will not be extended before we leave for the Fourth of July recess, I hope that Congress will act quickly upon its return to make sure that this very important program is reinstated and that no gap in the availability of the credit is created. 
The WOTC program is a public-private partnership which encourages businesses to hire individuals on public assistance or who otherwise have life situations that make them difficult to employ. Employers who hire these individuals receive an income tax credit of as much as forty percent of the first $6,000 in wages they pay. 
The WOTC program was established in 1996 as a replacement for the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC). Last year, as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act Congress affirmed its strong support for this program by extending it for nine months along with the other so-called `expiring provisions.' Unfortunately, the tax credit will expire at the end of this month before Congress will have an opportunity to extend it. 
The legislation we are introducing today extends the program for three years. This extension is vital to the continued success of the WOTC program. In speaking with employers who utilize the program, their biggest concern is the on again, off again nature of the credit. Participation in the program requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of the employer. The uncertainty surrounding the continuation of this program makes it very difficult for employers to make that commitment. The loss of program certainty reduces the incentive to hire those currently on public assistance. During previous breaks employers have scaled back their programs, and some have even abandoned the program altogether. 
Individuals hired under the WOTC program often require substantial time and effort on the part of an employer. In many instances these individuals lack even the most basic skills necessary to hold a job. Without the WOTC program there would be a strong disincentive for employers to make any effort to hire these individuals. The tax credit levels the playing field and gives these individuals an opportunity to move off the welfare rolls and take control of their futures. Thus far, nearly 300,000 people--mostly single mothers--have been hired under this program. 
Those eligible for the WOTC are: members of families receiving AFDC benefits; qualified veterans who are members of families receiving food stamp benefits; 18-24 years olds who are members of families receiving food stamp benefits; 18-24 year olds who live in an empowerment zone or enterprise community; summer youth (16-17 year olds) who live in an empowerment zone or enterprise community who are hired during the summer months; SSI recipients; economically disadvantaged ex-felons; and individuals with physical or mental disabilities who have been referred to employers after or while receiving rehabilitative services under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 
As I mentioned earlier, an employer will receive an income tax credit of forty percent of the first $6,000 in wages paid to an employee who is a member of one of these groups. Therefore, the maximum credit available is $2,400. The only exception is summer youth employees where the maximum amount of wages used to calculate the credit is $3,000. An employer can only receive this maximum credit, however, if the employee is employed for at least 400 hours. While that may sound like a short period of time, for many of these individuals, that represent a significant period of employment, perhaps longer than any job they've ever held. 
A smaller credit equal to 25% of the first $6,000 of wages is available to an employer in those instances where the employee works less than 400 hours. No credit is available for any employee who works less than 120 hours. 
The Work Opportunity Tax Credit is an important component of our efforts to make welfare reform work over the long term. It provides transitional assistance to employers who are willing to hire and take the time to train individuals before they become long-term welfare recipients and young people at high risk of going on public assistance programs. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting a long-term extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond. 
The report accompanying this legislation states that the committee has included $191.4 million for three `standard' C-130J aircraft (in addition to funding for two other C-130J variants). The Administration's budget request included funding for one standard C-130J for the active Air Force. Thus, the committee added two standard C-130Js to the budget. 
The report further states that these two standard C-130J aircraft added by this bill are designated for Reserve Component Modernization. However, the report appears not to include a designation for the requested C-130J. I would like to ask the Chairman, does the committee intend that all three of the standard C-130J aircraft in this bill--not simply the two added to the request--are designated for the Air National Guard?

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, page 44 of the committee report accompanying S. 2138, the fiscal 1999 Energy and Water Development Appropriation bill, includes a section on funding provided in the bill for construction of a flood control outlet at Devils Lake, North Dakota. At the end of the short section, the committee report states that, `[i]t is expected that such circumstances would also be such that granting of a waiver under the emergency provision of the National Environmental Policy Act would be appropriate and that the provision of the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty would be met.' 
I am trying to understand how this report language corresponds with language in the bill for Devils Lake. As reported by the committee, pages 6 and 7 of the bill lay out a detailed set of rigorous criteria that must be met before any funds can be obligated by the Secretary for actual construction of the outlet. Two of those criteria, full compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty seem to be preempted by the committee in this report. I ask the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, Senator Domenici, if the committee report language in any way supercedes the bill language? Moreover, is the committee attempting to provide a waiver or some form of relief under NEPA or the Boundary Waters Treaty?

Mr. CHAFEE. I appreciate my colleague's clarification. I chaired a hearing on Devils Lake before the Committee on Environment and Public Works late last year and am committed to addressing the terrible flooding problems experienced there. However, I am convinced that the people of North Dakota, Minnesota, Canada, and the U.S. taxpayers will all be served more effectively if we go about this project in the right way. To do that, we need the appropriate reviews, studies and justifications by the Army Corps of Engineers, State Department and others. In that context, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Congressional Record a January 28, 1998, Army Corps memorandum, signed by the then-Acting Assistant Secretary John H. Zirschky, that details the agency's policy on NEPA compliance and the proposed outlet at Devils Lake. I ask unanimous consent that the memorandum be printed in the Record.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am submitting a sense of the Senate resolution to designate the third Saturday in June of every year as `National Rivers Day.' Rivers touch each and every one of our lives. Every State and nearly every community in the United States has a river or stream going through it. Because every American has access to rivers and streams, what we do and how we live has a profound impact on the quality of the nation's rivers. 
The three million miles of rivers and streams that travel through the United States have played a fundamental role in our culture and our heritage. Indeed, the health of America's rivers inextricably linked to our health as a nation. Our rivers contribute to commerce, food production and public recreation, and they enhance our well-being. Rivers also support fish, waterfowl, and other wildlife that need clean water to survive in their habitat. 
The settlers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were awed by our majestic rivers, curious mixtures of pristine and rugged beauty. Since colonial times, America's rivers have promoted our economic and social growth, as an energy source to spur industrialization and as a water supply resource. 
Regrettably, in the late 1960's, although America had grown to be the most powerful industrial nation in the world, we had failed to protect the very resources that were responsible for our success. The Hudson River was a dumping ground for fuel and other industrial waste. The Cuyahoga River in Cleveland became so polluted that it caught fire. These terrible events prompted the call to reverse the trend and to clean up the nation's rivers and other waters. 
Today, the cleanup of our rivers and streams has led to the economic revitalization of urban centers, neighborhoods, and towns all over America. From Boston to Chicago to Washington, D.C., Americans are cleaning up their rivers and using them for recreation, boating, tourism and leisure. America's rivers continue to serve as transportation links supporting commerce and industry. Their greatest contribution to the U.S. economy, however, is the 430 billion dollars generated annually from the tourists that visit our rivers. And more than 46 million international tourists visit our rivers each year. 
The tide has turned significantly from the late 1960s and early 1970s, but we must continue to encourage ongoing protection and promotion of the nation's rivers. Designating the third Saturday in June of each year as `National Rivers Day' will inspire all Americans to get involved in the ongoing protection of our precious rivers and streams. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important measure.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues the tremendous news of the success of a group of nine fifth grade students from Rhode Island. These students won the U.S. Navy's national competition to be the first group of civilians ever granted the privilege of naming a United States Navy ship. These diligent young people from Oak Lawn Elementary School in Cranston overcame extraordinary competition being selected as finalists from more than 2,000 entries from across the United States. 
Last Friday, Secretary of the Navy John Dalton announced the Oak Lawn students' proposal to name the Navy's next oceanographic ship the U.S.S. Bruce Heezen was the winner of this competition. Heezen was a pioneer in mapping the ocean floor who died aboard a Navy submarine taking him to look for the first time at the ocean terrain. 
I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to these bright students and their teacher for their great achievement. I share with their families and community in recognizing the fabulous work they did in terms of conducting extensive group research and a wide range of individual projects. I also commend them for enthusiastically sharing their discoveries and knowledge with other schools in the area to educate their fellow students.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, otherwise known as the ISTEA reauthorization legislation. This was passed by the House and Senate on May 22, and the President will sign this historic legislation into law later this afternoon. 
In the rush to finish the conference before the Memorial Day recess--and I know the Chair remembers well the frantic hours that were taking place then--and during our subsequent efforts on the technical corrections bill to this overall legislation, I did not have an opportunity to speak about what was accomplished in this important bill. I also want to take this chance to thank the many people who were involved in the effort. 
First, a word about the legislation. It is the result of over 2 years of hard work and careful negotiation. But I think the final product is better for the extra time and effort that was put into it. 
This legislation builds upon the landmark achievements of the so-called first ISTEA legislation, which stands for Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. That was in 1991. Senator Moynihan of New York was chairman of our 
committee at the time, the Environment and Public Works Committee, and was, I think it is fair to say, the principal author of that landmark legislation in 1991. 
Now, how is this bill historic? And how is it different from the 1991 legislation? 
First, and most obvious, ISTEA II, or sometimes called the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, authorizes a record amount of funding for surface transportation: almost $218 billion for highway and transit programs over the next 6 years. 
Of this amount, almost $174 billion will be for highways--that includes bridges, obviously--$3 billion is for highway safety programs, and $41 billion is for transit programs. 
Now, $205 billion of these funds are authorized from the highway trust fund, and $13 billion from the general fund. In total, the funds provided in the conference report represent a 40 percent increase over the last so-called ISTEA legislation--40 percent increase. 
We will provide these record funding levels in the funding guarantee within a balanced budget. I think that is terribly important to remember, Mr. President. We are not increasing the Federal deficit, despite some of the statements that have been made in the various news media. 
For achieving these record funding levels for the highway program, Senators Byrd, Gramm, Warner and Baucus deserve special recognition, as well as Congressmen Shuster and Oberstar from the House. All of those Members fought long and hard to ensure transportation would receive substantial increases over the original ISTEA legislation. 
I know that the sums in this bill are large, and the press reports sometimes imply we spent too much, but I think we have to put all this into context. 
The bill authorizes, indeed, $218 billion. And I must say, that is a lot of money, as we all recognize. It is over 6 years. As I said, this represents a large increase over ISTEA I of 1991. 
However, and I think this is an important point, only about 30 to 40 percent of the total projected spending for highways and transit by all levels of government is encompassed in this legislation. People come up to me and say, well, isn't that a lot of money to be spending on transportation--that is, highways, bridges and transit--over the 6 years? Yes, it is a lot of money, but you have to realize it only represents about 30 to 40 percent of the total projected spending that will be done. 
Where does the other spending come from? It comes from counties, it comes from States, it comes from cities that are doing things on their own. 
In addition to record authorization levels, this legislation made significant changes to the way we budget for transportation at the Federal level. This legislation changed the budgetary treatment of the highway trust fund following the model set forth in a bill first introduced by Senator Bond, which I was pleased to cosponsor and work on with him, the so-called Bond-Chafee legislation. 
This bill ensures that all Federal gas tax revenues deposited into the highway trust fund are spent on transportation programs. In effect, this bill reestablishes the linkage between the highway trust fund taxes and transportation spending that was envisioned when the highway trust fund was created. If future revenues to the highway trust fund increase, then under this legislation the highway spending will increase; and, of course, it works the other way, likewise. If the amount going into the highway trust fund from the various taxes--principally the Federal tax on gasoline--decreases, then highway spending, likewise, will decrease. 
Now, using Congressional Budget Office projections, $198 billion of the total funding for highway and transit programs will be guaranteed under the new budget mechanism we have. Of the $198 billion, $162 billion is for highway and highway safety programs and $36 billion is for transit programs. It is important to note that this historic change which reestablishes the linkage between the trust fund moneys and trust fund spending was all accomplished within the balanced budget framework. We will keep the highway trust fund on budget as part of a unified budget and we will offset the increased spending with spending reductions in other programs. 
I want to thank Senator Bond for his tireless work on the so-called Bond-Chafee proposal, which provides the underlying foundation for the budget reforms we implemented in this legislation. I thank the cosponsors of the Bond-Chafee proposal for their input. I also want to thank Senator Domenici and his staff for their work throughout the year and for their help in crafting the final budget mechanism that will become law later this afternoon. 
I believe the original ISTEA was a landmark piece of legislation. I have said that many, many times. However, it is true that in the 1991 legislation there were some shortcomings, particularly for the so-called donor States. These were the States that put in substantially more into the trust fund than they got back. The original ISTEA established a 90 percent minimum allocation program which was intended to guarantee that each State at least got back 90 percent of what that State put into the trust fund. The problem was that it didn't work. The 90 percent only applied to some of the programs and wasn't structured mathematically to achieve its goals. The old minimum 
allocation calculation applied to fewer than 80 percent of the programs, leaving some States to receive a percentage share that was equal to 70 to 80 percent of their share of contributions. In other words, a program that was designed to make sure that every State got back at least 90 percent failed. Indeed, some States were left with between 70 plus up to 80 cents back on the dollars as opposed to the 90 cents. 
In this legislation, thanks to the leadership of Senator Warner and others in the Senate, tremendous efforts were made to guarantee that each State would get back--at least originally, we sought 92 percent. We weren't able to achieve that under the formula, but we did come up so that every State got back 90.5 cents for every dollar that State put into the trust fund, at least. So the donor States were put in far better shape than they previously had been under the old former legislation. 
Other members of the Environment and Public Works Committee who played a key role in achieving this result were all very, very helpful. In addition, we had Senators who were not on the committee who were very anxious about the program. Senators Abraham, Lugar, Coats, Mack, Graham, and Levin were diligent in their efforts to see that their States got back at least the 90.5 cents. 
Another area where ISTEA broke with the past is how priority projects, otherwise known as demonstration projects, are treated. I realize that these projects are viewed by some just like the demonstration projects of the past. However, I think the way we dealt with them in this legislation was somewhat different. First, the special projects, demonstration projects in this bill, did receive an amount of attention that was far out of proportion to their dollar significance. The high priority projects similar to those in ISTEA I only received 5 percent of the total. If you read the newspapers, you would think they were consuming 40 to 50 percent of the total. Not at all. These special projects received 5 percent of the total. In the original bill, priority projects were treated as mandatory spending, exempt from the appropriations process. In this legislation, priority projects are discretionary spending, subject to the obligation limitations in the appropriation process. 
Third, under the former bill, ISTEA I, priority projects were always funded at 100 percent of their authorized level. In other words, priority projects were not reduced when the total authorization went down. However, in this legislation, these projects were treated as the same as the other core projects, taking their share of any reduction caused by a shortfall in final appropriations. If the total amount goes down, the special projects go down, likewise. 
We made a sincere commitment to safety in this legislation, recognizing that more than 40,000 Americans die and 3 million are injured in highway crashes every single year in our country. This is a tragic effect for millions of American families. We recognized these statistics and included a variety of initiatives to address this terrible problem. We increased the Federal commitment to improve roadway safety, providing more than $6.6 billion for highway safety programs; $3.6 billion of that will be available for safety construction, efforts aimed at eliminating road hazards and improving safety at rail-highway grade crossings. We provided a little over half a billion in incentives to States to promote seatbelt use. Seatbelt usage is by far the most important step that vehicle occupants can take to protect themselves in the event of a crash. We provided half a billion in incentive programs to encourage States to adopt tough .08 blood alcohol concentration standards. This is something that Senators Lautenberg and DeWine worked very, very hard on. I want to recognize their efforts. 
Under the category of innovation, we recognized we must maintain the strength of the transportation system we have in place but we have to provide new tools to address new problems and supply new solutions. We have to look at ways to finance our substantial infrastructure needs, evaluating the potential of new methods to design and build infrastructure more efficiently so we have innovative financing provisions, the so-called Transportation Infrastructure Financing and Innovation Act. That is a mouthful. It is also known TIFIA. I want to thank Senators Graham and Moynihan for their leadership on that important provision. 
As far as intelligent transportation systems go, this is a forward-looking initiative. We have to make the most efficient use of our existing highways. We provide new options for transportation planners to address safety and capacity concerns. The objective is to move more vehicles in a safer fashion over the same amount of highway that exists--not expand the highways, just move more vehicles along the existing highways in a safe fashion. 
The environment received great attention in our legislation, and, I might say, so did ISTEA I in 1991. But we continued that. Indeed, we increased funding for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program. In other words, where congestion arises, we took efforts to mitigate those problems and the reflections that that congestion has upon our air quality. 
We boosted funding for the Transportation Enhancements Program. We increased that by 38 percent over the prior legislation of 1991. So States can use these funds for what we call transportation enhancements, such as bicycle and pedestrian facilities and historic or environmental preservation projects. 
We initiated a wetlands banking system to mitigate transportation's effect on wetlands. When we build new roads, all too often wetlands are affected. We want to promote wetlands restoration. We did that by making wetlands restoration a profitable private enterprise. 
We reauthorized and amended the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, which provides about $350 million annually to States throughout the Nation for sport fish restoration and boat safety programs. 
So these are some of the things that we did. We had environmental streamlining. We held the line on administrative expenses. We added a design-build system for contracting. Current law doesn't allow the use of the so-called design-build concept in highway construction. The design-build concept combines the design and construction phases of a highway project, allowing projects to be built faster and at less cost to the taxpayer. 
Mr. President, I will conclude by recognizing the tremendous efforts put forth in this legislation by the staffs and by the Department of Transportation. I want to thank Secretary Slater and Federal Highway Administrator Wykle for their time and effort on this bill and for making the full resources of the Department available to us. From the Department of Transportation, I thank specifically Jack Basso, Nadine Hamilton, Bud Wright and his staff, Tom Weeks, Bruce Swinford, Roger Mingo, Dedra Goodman, Frank Calhoun and his staff, Patricia Doersch, Bryan Grote, and David Seltzer. These individuals, particularly on the formula runs, were tremendously helpful. 
I thank Secretary Slater for allowing Cheryle Tucker from the Federal Highway Administration to be detailed to our committee for 16 months to help us on this. I thank all the conferees from the Environment and Public Works Committee; all 18 were conferees. I think that was very helpful to me, and I believe it worked well. These members took hours from their busy schedules to listen to summaries of what was taking place and offered suggestions. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Warner, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus, for their efforts in getting this legislation up to the full committee. 
Lastly, I would like to recognize the efforts of the Senate staff who worked so long and hard. Of course, I thank every single one of them. Particularly, I recognize the work of Jimmie Powell, who was just tireless, and a series of others who did such a good job. I am going to run over the names of some of those who worked on the reauthorization that I was particularly close with. Chris Hessler; Dan Corbett, of course, who was tireless and always present; Ann Loomis; Tom Sliter; Kathy Ruffalo, with Senator Baucus; Chris Russell; Gary Smith; Tracy Henke, with Senator Bond; Jason Rupp; Doug Benevento, with Senator Allard; 
Abigail Kinnison with the Environment and Public Works Committee; Al Dahlberg with the Environment and Public Works Committee; Linda Willard with the Environment and Public Works Committee; Ellen Stein with Senator Warner; Chad Bradley with Senator Inhofe; Chris Jahn with Senator Thomas; Gerry Gilligan with Senator Sessions; Rick Dearborn with Senator Sessions; Arnold Kupferman with Senator Moynihan; Polly Trottenberg with Senator Moynihan; Liz O'Donoghue with Senator Lautenberg; Kirsten Beronio with Senator Lautenberg; Drew Willison with Senator Reid; Melissa White with Senator Graham; Tim Hess with Senator Graham; Joyce Rechtscheffen with Senator Lieberman; Christopher Prins with Senator Lieberman; Rob Alexander with Senator Boxer; Joshua Shenkmen with Senator Wyden; Howard Menell with the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; Peggy Kuhn with the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; Joe Mondello with the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; Loretta Garrison with the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; Bill Hoagland with the Budget Committee; Brian Riley with the Budget Committee; Austin Smythe with the Budget Committee; Mitch Warren with the Budget Committee; Ann Begeman with the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee; Charlotte Casey with the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee; Clyde Hart with the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee; Bob Greenawalt with Senator Chafee; Ashley Miller with Senator Roth; Keith Hennessey with Senator Lott; Carl Biersak with Senator Lott; Janine Johnson with Senate Legislative Counsel; Peter Rogoff with Senator Byrd; Pam Sellers with Senator Coats; Steve McMilin with Senator Gramm; and Dave Russell with Senator Stevens. 
They all were tremendous, and I feel bad if I left out the names of any of them. So it goes, Mr. President, without the help of these individuals, we plain could not have gotten this legislation accomplished. So I thank every one of them. 
I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, over the past several days it seems to me that the Senate debate on the tobacco bill has taken a very unfortunate turn. It is a turn away from what I strongly believe are the purposes and objectives of the legislation. I want to remind my colleagues that the very name of the bill that we are dealing with is the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act. I want to accent the `Youth Smoking Reduction Act' portion of the title. 
Now, the purpose of this tobacco legislation is to fundamentally change the way tobacco products are marketed and sold in this country. Clearly, there is an epidemic sweeping the Nation. That is the rapid growth of teenage smoking and tobacco use. The Centers for Disease Control, as has been said many times on the floor, estimates that every day 3,000 young American children, teenagers, take up smoking and that one-third of these 3,000 will die prematurely because of smoking-related diseases. 
Thus, if you multiply that out, it is a million children a year, a million young American children under the age of 18, who join the ranks of adult smokers, and more than 300,000 of them will die prematurely. Over a 25-year period, that amounts to 8 million Americans dying early because of smoking. That is more 
Americans than were lost in all the major wars that our Nation has been involved with. 
As has been pointed out also frequently, tobacco use is the largest preventable cause of death in America today. In other words, if we want to look where can we do something about preventing deaths in our country, and should we tackle alcohol or should we tackle accidents or should we deal with illegal drugs or automobile accidents--yes, all of those are important, but none of them compares with the reduction in fatalities that would occur if we could eliminate smoking among the young people. 
The statistics are chilling. Tobacco-related deaths are four times the number of Americans who die every year from alcohol-related deaths. Tobacco-related deaths kill 9 times the number who die from accidental deaths and 44 times the number of Americans who die from illegal drugs. In America alone, 419,000 deaths occur as a result of tobacco-related illnesses, diseases. Nearly half a million every year in our country die from tobacco-related diseases. 
So, obviously, the way to prevent and discourage young people from taking up tobacco is in the beginning and doing all we can to encourage adults to cease smoking. 
Some of the amendments before us would take us far afield from that purpose. In other words, the objective of the exercise is to reduce teenage smoking, prevent it if possible, and to encourage adults to give up smoking. But these amendments we have before the Senate now go far afield from that. 
Let me begin with the drug amendment currently pending. This amendment would take $3 billion annually out of this bill to combat illegal drugs, which means we will have $3 billion less per year available for the war on tobacco. Now, we already have a war on drugs, and we are spending billions of dollars every year to combat the serious problems of illegal drugs. This may be a meritorious amendment. Maybe we should spent $3 billion more fighting drugs. But this isn't the place to do it. If there is an antidrug amendment to be brought up, bring it up as a freestanding amendment. See if the money is there somewhere to fund this initiative. If it is all that important, let's find the money for it. But it doesn't belong on this bill. 
Now, the next one, Mr. President, the marriage penalty tax relief proposal. Now, maybe that is a good proposal, but it has no place in this legislation. Correcting a bias in the Tax Code may make sense, but not on this bill. As the fiscal year 1999 budget process advances, we will have a chance to consider the marriage penalty. Indeed, the Senate budget resolution which we adopted here has $30 billion provided for tax cuts. That is the place where marriage penalties should go if it is that important. The budget resolution reported from the House Budget Committee calls for $100 billion in tax cuts. There is ample opportunity to do something about tax cuts and the marriage penalty. 
Now, I know one of the arguments for doing a tax cut in this bill is, it is enunciated they want to return some of the money that will be paid in the form of higher cigarette prices paid by smokers. It is said that the great majority of smokers are in the low-income or the middle-income group and that we ought to do something for them. Somehow that has a twist to it that isn't really sensible. I reject the argument that these individuals somehow need to be reimbursed. The fact is, because of the smoking of individuals in America, we all are paying vastly higher taxes than we ever would otherwise. We are paying higher Medicare costs, we are paying higher Medicaid costs, we are paying higher private health insurance premiums, because smokers insist on smoking, and they are the ones in whom, unfortunately, so many smoking-related illnesses occur. 
The fact of the matter is, smoking is a hidden tax on all taxpayers. The direct medical costs of treating smoking-related illnesses exceed $60 billion a year. We are all paying that--higher premiums on our health insurance, as I mentioned before. The current Federal excise tax on cigarettes does not begin to approach offsetting these additional costs. Thus, in my judgment, it is perfectly proper that smokers pay more than they are currently paying in taxes on cigarettes. 
Now, let me conclude by making a simple point. Here, the original McCain bill provided an increase in revenues of $65 billion. How is that money to be spent? 
It was to be spent with $26 billion going to the States. This is over 5 years--$26 billion to the States. NIH is to get $14 billion plus. In other words, cessation and prevention programs were to receive $14 billion. Agriculture, $10 billion over 5 years. This is the total; it comes to $65 billion. 
But now what is happening, Mr. President, is a whole series of things have been added on. Yes, the States stay at $26 billion. In comes illegal drugs, $15 billion, and marriage penalty, $15 billion. Veterans--we adopted that already--is at $3 billion, agriculture at $18 billion, public health at $14 billion, and NIH at $14 billion. In other words, the spending equalling the revenue--the revenue being $65 billion over 5 years, and suddenly it is up to $105 billion. Obviously, the traffic can't bear that. That is not what the taxes are going to produce. So something has to give. 
Mr. President, I remember this: There is a strong constituency for the States. Oh, yes, they want their money. The marriage penalty is very enticing and veterans has already been adopted. In agriculture, there is a strong constituency. What is going to fall out is the NIH and the public health programs. 
Mr. President, I think that is terribly unfortunate. And we see here what is going to lose. When we talk about health-related programs, we are talking not only about NIH, which is a separate thing, but there are cessation, prevention/education, counteradvertising, antismuggling, and youth access restrictions. Those are the things that are so important if we are truly concerned with reducing smoking amongst our young people, as the very name of this legislation provides. These are the things that will go out if we adopt these other proposals, attractive though they may be, for marriage penalty and antidrug activities. 
Mr. President, the point is there won't be resources for these programs that are so important. So I don't think that is where we want to be at the end of the day. I don't think we want to end up with these programs losing out because we have adopted the others. If the others are all that important--the antidrug provisions, illegal drugs, the marriage penalty relief--there will be a chance at another time to address those. But in this legislation let's stick with the objective, which is to reduce teenage smoking, prevent it from occurring in the beginning, and do all we can to encourage those who are smokers to give up that unfortunate habit. 
So for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the antidrug and the tax cut amendments. They are not about tobacco; they should not be in this bill. 
I thank the Chair.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I join with Senators Warner and Baucus today to introduce the Administration's 1998 Water Resources Development Act by request. 
After 16 years of stalemate over the appropriate cost sharing of navigation, flood control, environmental restoration, and other types of water projects, the Reagan administration and Congress were able to reach agreement on the landmark Water Resource Development Act (`WRDA') of 1986. As a part of that important compromise there was a general understanding that a two-year cycle of water project authorization bills would be established. With the exception of 1994, the administration and Congress have successfully worked together toward that end. 
It is time once again to continue the biennial water resources authorization cycle with a 1998 WRDA. The bill we introduce today on behalf of the administration represents an effort to identify worthwhile projects and policies in support of the Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works program. 
I and other members of the Committee on Environment and Public Works will conduct a thorough review of the administration's WRDA request, and the project and policy requests of individual Senators, to make sure that any bill reported to the full Senate later this year is economically and environmentally justified. 
Mr. President, this legislation is important to communities throughout the nation. I look forward to working closely with colleagues in the coming weeks to ensure enactment of WRDA '98.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I would like to address the question of the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act, S. 1415, this afternoon, which the Senate is resuming consideration of today. This is a very important bill, and I know the occupant of the Chair shares my concerns with this legislation and a concern that it be passed. This seeks to address a serious problem--tobacco use among our young people. 
Both conservatives and liberals fault this legislation. Some say it is not strong enough; some say it goes too far. I think it strikes an appropriate balance and merits our support. It is not a perfect bill, but I don't think we should let perfection be the enemy of the good. By striving constantly for what each of us wants in the perfect bill, we won't end up with anything. I am concerned about that. 
Madam President, if one counts the Mondays and Fridays as part of each working week, there are only 68 legislative days remaining in this congressional session before we adjourn for the midterm elections in the fall. Sixty-eight days is not very long. Time is of the essence if we are going to enact a comprehensive tobacco bill this year. I certainly believe Congress should enact such legislation. Thus, I am hopeful that, following a vigorous and healthy debate, the Senate will pass the McCain bill and send it along to the House. 
Given all the disinformation circulating about this legislation--most of it, I might say, initiated by the tobacco industry--I would like to take a few moments of the Senate's time to review the bidding as to why we are considering national tobacco legislation at this time. 
The opponents of S. 1415, the so-called McCain bill, would have us believe that this legislation is a case of tax and spend liberalism gone wild, that this bill is an excessive response to a relatively minor social problem--that of tobacco use among the young people--and that an antitobacco media campaign is all we need, that is an adequate response. Well, for years the tobacco industry sought to discredit studies which linked smoking to cancer and other diseases. Then the industry told us that nicotine was not addictive. Now the industry says it doesn't target kids with any advertising or marketing programs and that this legislation is just another opportunity--the McCain legislation--for Washington to increase taxes on the U.S. public. 
Let's look at the facts. There is indisputable consensus within the public health community that tobacco use constitutes the single most preventable cause of death in this country. In other words, of all the possibilities of reducing deaths in our country, including better exercise, reduction in fat consumption, conducting what we might call a healthful life, all of those things put together aren't as effective in improving the health of the United States of America as giving up smoking would be. In other words, it is the single most preventable cause of death. Who says that? Is it I, Senator Chafee from Rhode Island? Not at all. It is the Centers for Disease Control. 
Here is a chart. This chart says tobacco kills more Americans than alcohol, car accidents, suicides, AIDS, homicides, illegal drugs, and fires combined. In other words, all the effort we go to in this country to lecture people to use seat belts in order to reduce automobile accidents or fatalities and injuries from automobile accidents, and all we do about counseling in connection with suicides, and the money we pour into AIDS prevention and attempted cures, and homicides, and the battle against illegal drugs and fires, and all we do to prevent fires from occurring in households, and the lectures on alcohol--if you put all of those together, tobacco kills more Americans than alcohol, car accidents, suicides, AIDS, homicides, illegal drugs, and fires combined. 
So if we are serious about doing something about improving the health of Americans, we should try to make every effort to entice Americans not to take up smoking and, if they are smokers, to cease smoking. 
Here are the figures: Tobacco kills 418,000 Americans every year by tobacco-related diseases; alcohol is 105,000; about one-fourth of the deaths result from tobacco and fires, 4,300; illegal drugs, 9,000; and so forth. So you add them all together, and they don't amount to the figures that are causing the deaths resulting from tobacco-related diseases. 
Where is the problem? The problem lies in that every day it is estimated in the United States of America 3,000 children and young people start smoking in schoolyards, or wherever it might be, in our country. Every day, 3,000 youngsters take up smoking, and one-third of these will die prematurely as a result of that habit. In other words, if they smoke, the chances are that about 33 percent will die prematurely because of the habit of smoking. Each year, 1 million additional children--3,000 a day times 365 gets you very close to 1 million--1 million additional children become smokers. What we are aiming for in this legislation is to prevent that and reduce the number of children who take up smoking. 
There are those who say, `Oh, well, tobacco use is a matter of personal choice.' But is this true when you are talking about young people, impressionable children, 14, 15, 16, 17, in their teens? Ninety percent of those who take up smoking do so before the age of 18. In other words, if you can get someone by the age of 18 without having taken up smoking, the chances are excellent that individual will not become a smoker. Ninety percent of smokers have taken it up before the age of 18. 
Children obviously don't possess the same level of maturity as adults. They can't be expected to make the most thoughtful decisions on this life-and-death matter of smoking. Sometimes it is the `cool' thing to do, apparently. 
But the tobacco industry itself, in its own words--here is the internal document from R.J. Reynolds. `If a man'--or woman--`has never smoked by the age of 18, the odds are three-to-one he never will.' If you haven't smoked by 18, the chances are pretty good that you won't smoke ever--`three-to-one.' By the age of 24, if you can hold off and not smoke at the age of 24, the odds `are 20-to-one' that that individual you will not take up smoking. 
That is where we want to concentrate our efforts--on these young people in their early teens--and carry it up through the age of 24 when the chances are very, very good that an individual will not take up smoking. But the key group is 18 or younger. 
Is there an epidemic of smoking amongst young people? You bet your life there is. In my home State, where I never thought there was a particular abundance of smoking--it is not going like going to China, where everybody seems to be smoking. That doesn't seem to be true in my State. Yet the Centers for Disease Control say that 37 percent of high school children--I am not talking about high school seniors; I am talking about high school children; that would be the 12th, 11th, and 10th, and in some instances the 9th grade--smoke. That is more than 70,000 teen smokers in our State. We have 1 million people in our State, and 70,000 teen smokers, one-third of these high school students, will lose their lives prematurely because of this unhealthy habit. 
Here is a graph that shows the increase in the rates of smoking among high school seniors. Now we are talking seniors. It is remarkable. It went along pretty steadily at about 30 percent. Then in 1982 it even dipped down to about 27 percent. ] 
Then it shot up starting at about 1991, up until the middle 30s nationally. 
What has caused all of this? One of the things, obviously, that has caused it is the action of advertising to these young people, whether it is the Marlboro man, or Joe Camel, or whatever it is. All the advertising from the tobacco companies has been oriented toward inducing the young people to take up smoking. It is the `in thing.' They want to make it the `in thing.' The tobacco companies clearly do. 
One of the ironies of the opposition of the tobacco companies to the McCain bill is the suggestion that this bill was somehow dreamed up by a bunch of Washington bureaucrats. The fact of the matter is that most of the provisions in this bill have their origins in the global settlement the industry entered into with the 40 States' attorneys general last June. In other words, about a year ago the tobacco industry entered into a deal with 40 of the attorneys general from our 50 States. In that, they made a whole series of concessions. It had nothing to do with Washington, DC, or Washington bureaucrats, or tax-and-spend liberals in the U.S. Congress. It was all initiated and agreed to by the tobacco companies and the attorneys general. 
Let's tackle some of the things that came up in that agreement. 
What about the idea of a per-pack tax on cigarettes to discourage teenagers from smoking? In other words, what is the idea of increasing the tax, or fee, if you will, on each package of cigarettes that is sold in order to discourage teenagers from taking up smoking? Tobacco companies signed on to a 65-cents-per-pack increase during the settlement negotiations. Sixty-five cents they agreed to. That had nothing to do with Washington, DC. That was out in the hinterlands, out in the States, working with the tobacco companies and the attorneys general. 
What about financial penalties on the tobacco companies for failure to meet the annual youth smoking reduction target? This is the so-called look-back provision. If there isn't a reduction of x percent--this is written out in the contract, in the deal--if those reductions aren't achieved by 40 percent or 50 percent, whatever it might be, by such and such number of years, then the tobacco companies will have to pay an additional penalty. That is the so-called look-back provision at the end. At the end of 5 years of this deal, you look back and see if there has been this percentage reduction in teenage smoking. 
Where did that come from? Out of the bureaucrats in Washington? Not at all. The tobacco companies agreed to this during the settlement with the attorneys general. 
What about advertising and marketing restrictions? The industry signed off on that. 
What about receipts from those new taxes to fund public health programs such as counteradvertising, cessation of smoking efforts, community-based antismoking programs, and all of these things that we are now thinking are wise to reduce smoking in the United States--not just to get people to not take it up in the beginning, to help those who are smoking cease that very dangerous habit? Where did that come from? Did that come from Washington bureaucrats? Not at all. The industry agreed to it in their dealings with the attorneys general. 
The fact is, the McCain legislation is based largely on the negotiations which produced the so-called global settlement, comprehensive settlement, last June. 
Given the American public's distaste for new taxes, it is not surprising that the tobacco industry has seized upon the $1.10 increase in the price for a pack of cigarettes and has used this as a rallying cry of opposition. 
Let's understand this. Who is going to pay this tax? Only people who smoke. If they give up smoking, they won't pay the tax. Anybody who says they don't like the tax, quit smoking and they won't have to pay a nickel of it. 
Obviously, smokers are free to go on smoking. But I think we all ought to understand that all of us are paying when there are smokers in our society. Why are they paying? Because one-third of those smokers are going to suffer very severe sickness and illness as a result of their smoking. And the direct health care costs--in other words, whether Medicaid, Medicare, or other forms of assistance to those who smoke, or are suffering from smoking-related illnesses--are paid for by all of us in society. 
It costs $60 billion a year to care for those individuals. And when you take the lost productivity and the disability payments, it is estimated that smoking-related illnesses are causing American taxpayers over $100 billion a year. Now, even for somebody from Washington, $100 billion is a lot of money. That is what these tobacco-caused illnesses are costing the taxpayers in the United States. 
Madam President, I urge Members of this body and the public also to look closely at the facts I have enunciated here and not to be dissuaded from doing the right thing, not to be dissuaded by this blitz from the tobacco industry and the lobbying that is taking place. S. 1415, the McCain bill, is a comprehensive bill, it is a good bill and addresses a very serious problem in our country. The time for action on it is now, and I hope my colleagues will support efforts to pass the legislation. 
Madam President, seeing no one else wishing to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we have charts here and we will make them available for anybody who wishes to see them. I know that most of the Senators' staffs have been briefed already today on this. Those Senators who have not, we certainly would be delighted to meet with them and go over this chart and give them a copy. I think that is the way to do business. It is true that the report is not yet before us, and that was understood when we commenced this discussion, with the idea to save as much time as we could. The report will be along. Certainly, it is a massive report. People are going to have difficulty absorbing it, but those are the time exigencies we are working under at this time. 
Mr. President, pursuant to what the majority leader said, at this time I will discuss the philosophy behind this legislation and some of the difficulties that we encountered as we proceeded. The philosophy we had in this legislation was to repeat what took place, as far as the general philosophical approach in ISTEA I, which passed in 1991. Now, in 1991, the first time, we passed a measure that was truly a transportation bill rather than solely a highway bill. In other words, the philosophy in 1991 was to do the best we could to devise a system to move people and goods from point A to point B in the most efficient and safe manner. So, as I say, it was more than just a highway bill; it was a transportation bill. 
Mr. President, so thus we have this legislation, which deals not solely with highways, as I said, it deals substantially with mass transit. Likewise, indeed, it encourages what they call `intermodalism,' which is the blending of various methods of transportation. That is where the `I' comes from in Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. That is where the original ISTEA acronym came from. We believe we followed out that philosophy in connection with this legislation, which sometimes we call ISTEA II. 
Mr. President, we then came to the always-difficult part of determining how to divide up the funds. You have a limited amount of funds, and how do you divide them? So we have a formula that is worked out. In that formula, you take into account vehicle miles traveled, number of lanes, mile lanes in the State, you take into account bridge problems, and a host of other factors, and that becomes the formula. 
When you run something like that, you frequently end up with difficulties. Not everything comes out just the way you want it. So we made adjustments to the best of our ability. One of the points that was cardinal in our approach on this legislation was that all the donor States--that is, the States putting in more than they get back--should at least receive-- 
originally, we strived for 91 cents back on the dollar. In other words, every dollar a donor State put in, the effort was made to get 91 cents back because, in ISTEA I, we have a series of States who received back 88 cents, or even less than that in some instances. 
Now, when you try to bring States up from below 90 cents or 88 cents, wherever it might be--for example, California, under ISTEA, was at 89 cents. You would think just bringing California up 3 cents for every dollar put in would be a simple thing. Well, mechanically, it is; but cost-wise, it is very expensive. So despite our sincere efforts to get everybody 91 cents back on the dollars contributed, the best we could do was 90.5 cents. Therefore, if you look down the list of those receiving moneys, you will find there is no State below the 90.5, and that is a very, very significant achievement. Now, do we have some States who are getting back more than a dollar? Of course, we do. Those are the donee States. But we believe that, taking into consideration all the factors, we ended up with a fair deal. 
The average increase that was received across the country was 43 percent. That is the increase over ISTEA I. In some instances, States go to more than that. Alabama is at 60.6 cents in increase, for example. Some States were less. But that is what comes about when you strive to reach as much fairness as possible. 
Let me say, there are frequently distorting factors that get into these equations. What would be an example of a distorting factor? A distorting factor would be a State that had received very, very significant additional amounts in a prior year--that is, when the formula was worked out under ISTEA I. Pursuant to that, that State received either a monstrous amount of projects, or very significant amounts of other moneys coming from various sources that distorted the picture of that State, so that you could not take that State with the very high additional amounts that it had received through projects, grants, project moneys, and expect to get a 40-percent increase on top of it. So that accounts, in some instances, for the fact that some States would be considerably lower than the 43-percent increase over ISTEA I. 
So, Mr. President, I am prepared to talk with anybody about this. As I say, I think many staffs have been briefed. We have tried to keep certainly the conferees from the Environment and Public Works Committee briefed as we went along. We had a whole series of meetings to try to keep them briefed. It is true that when you do negotiations like this, you don't have 65 people from each side in the room. There has to be a limited number of negotiators in order to get moving along. We were fortunate in our negotiations. We always included, every step of the way, the ranking member and representatives from his side of the aisle. Likewise, I was tremendously assisted in this by the chairman of the subcommittee dealing with this subject. That is, the Infrastructure Subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Warner of Virginia. It so happened that the ranking member of the full committee is also the ranking member on that Infrastructure Subcommittee. So that Senator Baucus was, in fact, wearing two hats. 
Mr. President, I think the result is not everything all our way. No; it isn't. But that is what happens when you get into negotiations. 
One of the things I am very glad about is that some of the language that was in the House bill was not accepted. In other words, it was dropped. Of course, there are some things that we had that were likewise dropped. But some of the provisions--for example, the so-called `mid-cost correction'--which would reopen this whole subject in 3 years we felt was not constructive. To go through all of this another 3 years from now would not be something we would countenance. 
Mr. President, I am glad to yield to the distinguished ranking member and have him address his remarks to what we have been undertaking.

Mr. CHAFEE. As the Senate considers the conference report for the Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century, I want to take a moment to discuss the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program that is part of this bill. 
The DBE program was designed to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to compete for the many billions of dollars in contracts that will flow from this legislation. The program, which has been in place since 1982, has proven both necessary to and effective in our efforts to remedy discrimination in transportation procurement markets. By reauthorizing the DBE program again this year, Congress has signaled its belief that the evidence remains clear: we need this program if we are to remove the continuing barriers confronted by minority- and women-owned businesses. 
Let me take a moment to share with my colleagues additional information that has come to light since the two chambers last considered the DBE program. A disparity study conducted for the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and released in April found that there was a disproportionately small number of women- and minority-owned contractors participating in Colorado's transportation construction industry. The study showed that African-Americans received none of the state-funded highway construction contracts over $500,000. Hispanic firms received less than one-half of one percent (.26%), and women-owned businesses were awarded less than one-quarter of one percent (.18%). The vast majority of contracts--more than 99 percent--went to firms owned by white men. The authors found that a significant disparity existed between what minority contractors actually received and what they might be expected to receive in the absence of discrimination. 
The Colorado study also demonstrated that the DBE program has worked in leveling the playing field for women- and minority-owned firms. It notes that `only when a DBE program has been in effect, has there been any significant dollar amounts utilized with [minority-/women-owned] firms.' 
The fact of the matter is that discrimination continues to plague minority- and women-owned firms in America. Congress has a strong and compelling interest in remedying this situation; and in the DBE program, we have had and will continue to have an effective tool.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation reducing the excise tax on vaccines from seventy-five cents to twenty-five cents per dose. I am introducing this bill along with my colleagues on the Finance Committee, Senators Breaux, Mack and Rockefeller as well as Senators Daschle, Murkowski, Cochran, Inouye, Lugar, Bumpers, Frist, and Santorum. 
Vaccines are a modern miracle--preventing disease and illness often for a lifetime with just a few doses. Vaccines have virtually eliminated the scourge of smallpox in the world. Polio as a wild virus has been eliminated in the western hemisphere. Measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus and hepatitis vaccines have saved thousands of lives. Technology in vaccines is on the brink of preventing other diseases ranging from Lyme disease to widespread rotavirus in the third world. 
Unfortunately, there is a small minority of children whose systems cannot handle vaccines and become injured. Recognizing this problem and acknowledging that childhood vaccination is required, Congress in 1986 set up a Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund into which federal excise taxes are paid. This modified no-fault system allows parents of vaccine-injured children to receive compensation for their children if the vaccine is covered by the fund. Childhood vaccines recommended by the federal government for routine use in children are covered (1) once approved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, (2) added to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), and (3) included on the list of vaccines on which the tax is imposed by Congress. 
When the trust fund was established there was no experience with what claims would commit to and what the size of the tax should be. Estimates were made and different tax levels were established for each vaccine. 
By 1993, it was apparent that the tax levels were far too high and a surplus was building up in the fund. Today that surplus totals 1.2 billion dollars. The Ways and Means and Finance Committees directed the Administration to study the system 
and develop a proposal that solves the overfunding problem. 
A consensus proposal was drafted and signed on to by all sectors of the public health community--physicians, manufacturers, parent's groups and health departments. That plan called for a new flat tax of 51 cents per antigen (or disease). But even this new rate was far more than was necessary to fund the system. For example, the guardian of the fund, the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, recommended 25 cents per antigen even when the surplus was half its level today. 
Last year, as part of the balanced budget bill, Congress established a single rate tax structure but did so at a level of seventy-five cents per dose. The seventy-five cents per dose amount was chosen to satisfy the revenue neutrality goals of the overall bill. Congress did not solve the overfunding problem and the result was that while some vaccine taxes were reduced dramatically, others were increased. Three new vaccines were added to the program at the seventy-five cents per dose rate. 
At the beginning of this year, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund had a balance of 1.2 billion dollars. If you assumed that future outlays from the fund would be twice as large as the fund's average over the past eight years, it would take more than 20 years to exhaust the assets in the trust fund, even if no excise tax revenues were collected from this date forward. Stated another way, the interest earned on the trust fund assets is more than enough to pay annual claims and administrative cost. As with many other trust funds within the federal budget, these taxes are being used for other federal spending. 
This proposal will also provide significant benefits to the states. When states purchase vaccines they pay the excise tax. Our bill would save the States $52 million annually. For my home state of Rhode Island, that would amount to 353,000 dollars annually. By lowering these taxes we can lower health care costs to vaccine recipients and providers while saving states and the federal government the money they now pay in excise taxes when they buy vaccines. 
This proposal is supported by physicians, state health departments, manufacturers and parental groups. Most significantly, the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV) which Congress created to make recommendations on changes to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, strongly supports this proposal. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this important health initiative.

<TEXT>
Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, let me offer a few thoughts on why I believe the amendment authored by my good friend from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, should be rejected. 
Senators Tom Harkin, Bob Graham and I struggled with the liability issue when we were developing our own antitobacco bill, the so-called KIDS Act. We began our deliberations with a review of the global settlement that was reached by the 40 attorneys general from the various States. In summary, we concluded that we could not support some of the provisions of that legislation; namely, the prohibition on class action suits. 
The attorneys general agreed that no class action suits would be permitted and there would be a ban on punitive damages against the industry. That is what the industry got out of the negotiation with the attorneys general, amongst other things. 
Given the tobacco industry's behavior, how could we, the three of us working on that legislation, possibly accede to tort protections that would nullify entire categories of lawsuits, leaving injured parties high and dry? 
But there were balancing factors which also had to be weighed, Mr. President. The industry's consent is terribly important to the implementation of a comprehensive national tobacco policy. It is far better to have the industry at the table and agreeing. 
Certainly, endless litigation serves no one's interests but the lawyers. Thus, something had to be done to create a more certain environment, both for the plaintiffs and for the tobacco companies. Hence, we decided to include an annual liability cap in our bill of $8 billion; $8 billion would be paid out each year and that was it. If there were subsequent suits and judgments had been brought and earned previous thereto or subsequent, they would fall in line and collect in the ensuing years. 
While the structure of the cap in Senator McCain's bill is somewhat different than the cap we had in our bill, nonetheless the intent is the same. The cap in the McCain bill does not stop a single lawsuit. It doesn't prevent a single lawsuit from being brought. It doesn't stop one injured party from being able to collect. Moreover, only those tobacco companies that accept and abide by the terms of this bill will be able to obtain the financial predictability that is provided by this liability cap. In other words, the company doesn't get the cap unless it agrees to a series of requirements upon the companies or company that we believe are very important to reach a fine settlement. 
What are some of these? What do the tobacco companies have to do to be eligible for a so-called cap? It must sign a national protocol, a binding consent decree to assure it will abide by all terms of the McCain bill. It must agree not to delay its implementation through endless court challenges. These terms they must agree to, amongst other things, are: They must make very steep annual payments to the Federal Government. They must meet tough annual youth smoking reduction targets. In other words, there are percentages that youth smoking must go down each year. The companies have to meet those requirements. It obviously encourages them to come forward with ingenious stop-smoking efforts or cease from smoking or decline from taking up smoking. They must pay large fines if they fail to meet these goals. 
What they also agree to is to fundamentally alter the way the tobacco products are manufactured and distributed, and they accept the regulation of tobacco products by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, so-called FDA. 
If tobacco companies fail to abide by the terms of this bill, they are not going to be eligible for the liability cap. The liability cap is something that helps the companies reach some certitude of what their payments are going to have to be. But if they don't meet these terms, they lose the rights under the cap. If they fail to meet the annual youth smoking reduction targets by more than 20 percent in any given year, they lose the protection of the cap. If they are caught evading the antismoking provisions, they lose the protection of the cap. So this isn't some giveaway to the tobacco industry. It is a necessary trade-off to obtain a strong national tobacco control policy. 
At the end of the day, when all is said and done, we hope the tobacco industry will return to the table and sign the consent decrees which will accompany this bill. If the Gregg amendment is adopted, it reduces, obviously, the chances for that occurring. 
What is the incentive for a tobacco company to come to the table if they lose even this cap protection? If we all are for obtaining the strongest possible antitobacco policy, then we ought to vote to table this amendment; that is, the amendment of the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. 
President Clinton supports the cap, as do many others who want a tough national policy to discourage youth smoking. Giving some predictability to tobacco companies who are willing to change the way they do business, it seems to me, is a small price to pay to get them at the table and participating in implementing these tough policies--indeed, the advertising policies to cease certain types of advertisements and to enter into other kinds of advertisement directed toward encouraging young people to give up smoking or to deter them from taking it up in the beginning. 
So, Mr. President, I believe that the cap is a very worthwhile part of this McCain bill. And I urge my colleagues to reject the proposed amendment. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here today to support this important amendment offered by Senators Kennedy, Graham, Harkin, and others. I have worked closely with Senators Bob Graham and Tom Harkin for the past several months on the issue of a comprehensive tobacco bill. We came to one inescapable conclusion, which has been voiced by the Senator from North Dakota and a host of others this afternoon: A steep increase in the price of tobacco products over a short time is the single most important thing we can do to reduce tobacco use among children, or to deter them from taking up smoking. 
How did we come to this conclusion? Well, Mr. President, we listened to the experts. Who are the experts? They are economists, public health researchers, and even tobacco industry officials. They have all concluded that price increases dramatically reduce smoking among children. 
When I say experts, who am I talking about? Mr. President, there are plenty to choose from. The Institute of Medicine, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Cancer Institute, U.S. Department of Treasury, and U.S. Surgeon General have all documented the fact that increases in tobacco prices have been shown to decrease tobacco use among children. 
Furthermore, Mr. President, economists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Michigan, among others, have found a strong relationship between cigarette prices and youth smoking. Cigarette prices go up, youth smoking declines; cigarette prices go down, youth smoking increases. These institutions that I ticked off are hardly fly-by-night institutions. 
If we doubt the expertise of these groups, why don't we take a look and see what the tobacco industry has said. I know the Senator from North Dakota has some quotes from the tobacco industry. I would like to supplement those with others. 
In 1981, the Philip Morris documents show that company officials said the following: 
`Since youth and young adult price elasticity are much larger than adult price elasticity'--in other words, the relationship between price going up, consumption down; price down, consumption up; those are what we call elasticities--`while adult smokers account for the bulk of cigarette sales, a substantial excise increase would substantially reduce smoking participation by young new smokers, but leave industry sales largely unchanged.' 
In other words, it is the young people who decline. The old people, it does not affect them. That is a Philip Morris official saying that. 
Mr. President, the evidence is clear. The most effective thing we can do to prevent our children from taking that first deadly cigarette is to increase the price quickly and steeply. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Kennedy amendment. 
I thank the Chair. I thank the floor managers.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this bill with my colleague Senator Allard. This bill represents a move towards efficient use of government funds, and support for the valuable programs carried out with those scarce funds. The bill would initially generate approximately $1 million for the Service through the sale of items derived from fish and wildlife that are currently stored by the Service. This money would be used to cover the costs of disposing of these items--which is now a financial drain on the Service--and to fund programs that loan these items to schools and Native American groups for educational and religious purposes. 
Each year, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) receives hundreds of thousands of items derived from fish, wildlife and plants, such as skins, furs, feathers, jewelry, etc. These items can be seized, forfeited or abandoned during enforcement of Federal wildlife laws, and they are eventually shipped to the National Wildlife Property Repository in Colorado. The Repository currently has about 150,000 items, with about 50,000 items stored elsewhere. 
Under current law, the Service may dispose of fish, wildlife or other items forfeited or abandoned to the U.S. government, either by loan, gift, sale or destruction. There are certain restrictions on disposal of those items. For example, items made from threatened or endangered species, marine mammals and migratory birds cannot be sold according to the laws that apply to those particular species. 
Revenue from the sale of forfeited items go to the Service for certain program operations; however, revenue from the sale of abandoned items go to the General Treasury, and are not available to the Service. More than 90 percent of the fish and wildlife items are abandoned, so that the Service would receive very little revenue from sales of these items. Indeed, under current law, the costs of selling these items would outweigh any revenue, so that the Service has no incentive to sell them. 
The Service must further expend funds for the shipment, storage and disposal of the items that it acquires. In addition, the Service will make many of these items--those that cannot be sold under law--available for Native American religious and ceremonial purposes, educational purposes, and research, but must expend its own funds to do so. The Repository was appropriated $310,000 for operations last year. After overhead, only $61,000 was available for disposal of these items. 
Disposal includes two programs in particular. The first, known as Cargo for Conservation, provides wildlife specimens to schools for educational programs. Under this program, the Service has distributed almost 400 educational kits to various organizations. The second program provides eagle carcasses and parts to Native Americans for religious and ceremonial purposes. Under this program, the Service has filled almost 1,500 requests for eagles, eagle parts and other raptors in 1997 alone, although there is currently a two year backlog in filling orders for some eagle carcasses. 
The bill would specifically amend the Fish and Wildlife Improvement Act in two ways. First, it would authorize the deposit of proceeds from the sale of forfeited and abandoned items into Service accounts rather than into the general treasury. Second, it would expand the use of funds received through these sales to include costs incurred by shipping, storage and disposal of these items, as well as payment of any liens on these items. 
I would like to note that this bill does not change existing authority with respect to items that may be sold by the Service. It does not allow the sale of items derived from threatened and endangered species, marine mammals, or migratory birds. The Service already has authority to sell certain items for which it is lawful to do so. This bill merely allows the Service to keep revenues derived from any items it sells, and to use those revenues for certain programs. This is a bill representing efficient use of government funds. 
At the same time, this bill is not intended to imply that the Service should sell everything that it lawfully can in order to maximize profits. It is my understanding that the Service has no intention to sell items derived from sensitive species, including those that are candidates for listing as endangered or threatened. It is also my expectation that, in considering which items to sell, the Service would take into account the biological status of any species used for that item, and any implications that the sale may have for conservation efforts relating to that species. For example, any sale by the Service should not encourage new markets that may undermine protections elsewhere. Lastly, the Service should ensure that the sale of these items does not undermine enforcement efforts within the U.S. 
In summary, I am pleased to cosponsor this bill with Senator Allard. Our staffs have worked closely with each other and with the Administration in drafting this legislation, and I look forward to working on this bill in the future.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to reauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act of 1984. This legislation makes important changes in the Foundation's charter, changes that I believe will allow the Foundation to build on its fine record of providing funding for conservation of our nation's fish, wildlife, and plant resources. 
The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation was established in 1984, to bring together diverse groups to engage in conservation projects across America and, in some cases, around the world. Since its inception, the Foundation has made more than 2,300 grants totaling over $270 million. This is an impressive record of accomplishment. The Foundation has pioneered some notable conservation programs, including implementing the North American Waterfowl Management plan, Partners in Flight for neotropical birds, Bring Back the Natives Program, the Exxon Save the Tiger Fund, and the establishment of the Conservation Plan for Sterling Forest in New York and New Jersey, to name just a few. 
Mr. President, the Foundation has funded these programs by raising private funds to match federal appropriations on at least a 2 to 1 basis. During this time of fiscal constraint this is an impressive record of leveraging federal dollars. Moreover, all of the Foundation's operating costs are raised privately, which means that federal and private dollars given for conservation is spent only on conservation projects. 
I am proud to count myself as one of the `Founding Fathers' of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. In 1984, I, along with my colleagues Senators Howard Baker, George Mitchell, and John Breaux, saw the need to create a private, nonprofit group that could build public-private partnerships and consensus, where previously there had only been acrimony and, many times, contentious litigation. 
The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation has more than fulfilled the hopes of its original sponsors. It has helped to bring solutions to some difficult natural resource problems and is becoming widely recognized for its innovative approach to solving environmental problems. For example, when Atlantic salmon neared extinction in the U.S. due to overharvest in Greenland, the Foundation and its partners bought Greenland salmon quotas. I and many others in Congress want the Foundation to continue its important conservation efforts. So, today I am introducing amendments to the Foundation's charter that will allow it to do just that. 
Mr. President, this legislation is quite simple. It makes three key changes to current law. First, the bill would expand the Foundation's governing Board of Directors from 15 members to 25 members. This will allow a greater number of those with a strong interest in conservation to actively participate in, and contribute to, the Foundation's activities. 
The bill's second key feature authorizes the Foundation to work with other agencies within the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce, in addition to the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Mr. President, it is my view that the Foundation should continue to provide valuable assistance to government agencies within the Departments of the Interior and Commerce that may be faced with conservation issues. Finally, it would reauthorize appropriations to the Department of the Interior and the Department of Commerce through 2003. 
Mr. President, I believe that this legislation I introduce today will produce real conservation benefits and I strongly urge my colleagues to give the bill their support.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation regarding one small aspect of the national tobacco debate. This bill addresses the problem of second-hand smoke, also known as Environmental Tobacco Smoke, or ETS for short. It is my hope that the ideas contained in this bill can be incorporated into any tobacco legislation acted on by the Senate. 
The Committee on Environment and Public Works recently held a hearing on ETS at which we learned that the principal victims of second-hand smoke are children who live with smokers. Tobacco smoke has devastating consequences for children under 18 months of age. Annually, up to 15,000 infants are hospitalized for lung infections caused by ETS such as bronchitis and pneumonia. These severe lung infections claim the lives of hundreds of children each year. 
Second-hand smoke is also responsible for less severe lung infections in 300,000 infants, 26,000 new cases of asthma among children, millions of middle ear infections, and roughly half the cases of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). These preventable illnesses, but 40 percent of children in one multi-State study were found to be routinely exposed to tobacco smoke. 
The bill I am introducing today would assign some of the funds collected under any national tobacco settlement approved by Congress to a state grant program to educate parents about the dangers of smoking in the home. The statistics I just recited are not widely known by parents. Once aware of the profound risk ETS poses for their child, most parents will go to great lengths to protect their child, and I believe that even includes parents who smoke. 
With the grant funds from this bill, States could provide information about ETS to pediatricians and other child care professionals for distribution to parents. States also could develop advertising aimed at parents. We only need to arm parents with information. They will do the rest. 
This bill has a few other provisions. It affirmatively states that there is no federal preemption of State or local efforts to address ETS. It would ban smoking on international flights that originate or terminate in the United States. It also would extend and codify the President's Executive Order banning smoking in federal buildings. My good friend, Senator Warner, in his capacity as Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, is working to ban smoking from the public areas of the Senate. I applaud this effort and encourage my colleagues to support it. My legislation would complement his efforts in other federal buildings. 
This bill does not address the question of smoking in private workplaces. Up to 3,000 adults die each year from lung cancer caused by ETS. Because of this statistic, some have argued that the federal government should ban smoking in nearly every building in the nation. Most legislative proposals on this issue would subject every dress shop and church hall in the nation to federal smoking regulations. 
Ironically, most of those bills exempt bars and restaurants and other places where smoking can be common. That means they ignore the few places where employees faced a substantial threat from ETS while regulating every other workplace. I believe that there is a more efficient way to address workplaces with dangerous levels of ETS. 
We should allow State and local governments to take the lead on this matter, but we also should help them to solve the problem. Some towns and States have taken action already. We can encourage more of them to do so by expanding the grant program described in my bill to reward States that reduce dangerous levels of ETS in the workplace. Incentive grants would allow States to tailor their solutions to address local concerns. Some States could seek a gradual ban while others may establish protective ventilation standards. 
Any rule that requires changing a habit as deeply ingrained as smoking will be met with resistance. In contrast to a federal one-size-fits-all approach, State and local efforts can be tailored more easily to local concerns, and will, therefore, be more effective. 
I did not address smoking in the workplace in my bill because I hope to work with other interested members to develop language that will be supportable on both sides of the aisle. Such a provision must both avoid rigid federal mandates and provide real incentives for States to address those workplaces with dangerous levels of ETS. I will continue to work with interested parties in an effort to devise such a provision. In the meantime, I wanted to offer the balance of my proposal for the Senate's consideration.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of our Finance Committee for yielding me some time on this matter. 
I rise to oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Nebraska. This amendment offers the Senate an alternative to the Finance Committee's plan to pay for the tax relief provided in the IRS reform bill, but the reality is that the Kerrey amendment would prevent meaningful Superfund reform. The amendment, I believe strongly, should be rejected. 
I oppose this amendment, obviously, but let me tell you what I do support. I support reimposition of the Superfund taxes. I also support reasonable Superfund reform. We will need to reimpose the three Superfund taxes--namely, the corporate environmental income tax, the excise taxes on crude oil and the excise tax on chemical feedstock--to provide the revenue to pay for a fairer Superfund Program. 
Why do I keep talking about Superfund? Mr. President, the Committee on Environment and Public Works reported a Superfund bill to the floor 6 weeks ago. Just yesterday, the committee received CBO's estimate on the bill. As we expected, we will need to reimpose the Superfund taxes in order to pay for the Superfund reforms and the Superfund reauthorization. In other words, if we gobble up this money now in connection with the IRS reforms, the money won't be there for the Superfund bill which we are moving along now and which has used in the past these very funds; in other words, these are Superfund taxes. 
The Kerrey amendment, if adopted, would prevent meaningful reform of the Superfund Program. I could discuss at length the numerous problems that plague Superfund. There is no question it has a lot of difficulties. I am prepared to explain the solutions we propose in our comprehensive Superfund bill that is on the floor now, but it is not necessary to do that today. 
While the Environment and Public Works Committee reported our Superfund bill on an 11-to-7 vote--there are 18 members of our committee, 10 Republicans and 8 Democrats--the bill was reported out in really a nearly partisan vote by 11 to 7 with only one Democratic Senator in support. However, there is bipartisan consensus that the Superfund has to be reformed. 
There wasn't, obviously, agreement with the way the Republicans on the committee wanted to proceed, but, nonetheless, there is agreement that the Superfund legislation needs to be reformed. Indeed, I see the ranking member of the 
committee now, and he devoted many hours of his time to this effort for reform. 
He also knows it will be necessary to offset the spending in any Superfund reform by reimposing these Superfund taxes. This was the case when Senator Baucus chaired the committee and reported a Superfund bill in 1994, and it still remains the case today. If we are going to have Superfund reform, we are going to need these moneys that now are apparently being seized or attempting to be seized by Senator Kerrey to use for this other purpose; namely, the IRS changes. 
The Kerrey amendment would preclude any meaningful reform of the Superfund Program. In other words, how are we going to pay for the thing? We wouldn't be able to if this Kerrey amendment is adopted. 
The real issue before us is whether the Senate wants to abandon Superfund reform. If we do, then go ahead and vote for the Kerrey amendment. If you don't, if you want Superfund to take place and do something about the brownfields redevelopment, for example, we have to have these moneys. There aren't other revenues around that we can use. The Kerrey amendment would preempt reform. The amendment would frustrate any Superfund reform efforts. I believe it is bad public policy to take these taxes and use them to pay for tax relief in the absence of Superfund reform. 
Mr. President, I strongly hope this amendment will be rejected and that we can all agree we are saving these Superfund taxes. They will have to be reimposed at sometime when we get a reauthorization of the Superfund legislation, but let's save them for that purpose, the purpose they have been used for in the past and the purpose I believe they should be used for in the future. 
I thank the Chair, and I urge my colleagues to support the Roth amendment and to reject the Kerrey amendment. 
Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Authorization Act. I am introducing this bill at the request of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees, in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Joining me as cosponsors of the bill are the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Senators Warner and Baucus. 
The concept of a national center for the performing arts originated during the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. President Eisenhower envisioned a national cultural center in the nation's capital, and in 1958, with the support of Congress, he signed into law the National Cultural Center Act, which established the Center as an independently administered bureau of the Smithsonian Institution. Following the death of President Kennedy, the Congress in 1964 renamed the Center in honor of the late president. 
The Kennedy Center was opened to the public in September 1971. The response was overwhelming--so much so that the Center's Board of Trustees requested help from Congress in maintaining and operating the Center, for the benefit of the millions of visitors. In 1972, Congress authorized the National Park Service to provide maintenance, security, and other services necessary to maintain the facility. For the next two decades, the Park Service received federal appropriations for the maintenance and operation of the Presidential monument. 
In the early part of this decade, however, it became clear that the Kennedy Center facility--which had not seen comprehensive capital repair since its opening--had deteriorated significantly due to both age and intensive public use. Those repairs that had taken place--such as the 1977 repair of the leaking roof--were undertaken in response to threatening conditions. The Board of Trustees, with the support of the Park Service, therefore set out to achieve a more effective long-term approach to management of the facility, with one entity responsible for both the care of the physical plant and the staging of performance activities. 
In 1994, therefore, Congress approved and the President signed the John F. Kennedy Center Act Amendments (Public Law 103-279). That Act authorized the transfer of all capital repair, operations, and maintenance of the facility from the Park Service to the Board of Trustees. 
The Act also directed the Board to develop a comprehensive, multi-year plan for the restoration and ongoing maintenance of the Kennedy Center. In 1995, the Board delivered the Comprehensive Building Plan, which set forth a long-term, two-stage program for the remediation of substandard building conditions, as well as continuous maintenance for the future. Phase I, scheduled for Fiscal Years 1995 through 1998, has concluded successfully. During this time, several major projects were completed, including the installation of a new, energy-efficient heating and cooling system, replacement of the leaking roof and roof terrace, and the major renovation of the Concert Hall. Phase II is scheduled to take place over the next eleven fiscal years, through Fiscal Year 2009. This stage will involve the massive `Center Block' project, during which the Opera House will be overhauled, as well as projects to make improvements to the plaza, improve accessibility to the theaters, install fire and other safety technology, and make a host of other repairs designed to ensure that the facility meets life safety standards. 
That brings us to the legislation I am introducing today. For the major Phase II projects to get underway, Congress must revise the 1994 Act to authorize appropriate funding for the next several fiscal years. The bill I am introducing today authorizes significant funding levels for the next eleven fiscal years for maintenance as well as capital repair work. 
Over the next several weeks, I and other members of the Committee on Environment and Public Works intend to review carefully the planned repair activities and the authorization request. The Kennedy Center is a living Presidential memorial and a national monument, and as such demands a high standard of maintenance and upkeep. As an ex-officio member of the Board, and Chairman of the authorizing Committee, I am dedicated to the appropriate restoration and preservation of the facility, which millions of Americans have enjoyed for more than a quarter of a century. Nevertheless, it is Congress' duty on behalf of the taxpayers to scrutinize this request closely. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate, the Administration, and the Kennedy Center Board to ensure that we allocate federal resources in an effective and responsible manner.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this morning here in Washington, Dr. John E. Sirmalis, Commander of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) in Newport, Rhode Island, is receiving the Distinguished Executive Award. Vice President Gore will take part in this ceremony. 
Having worked with John Sirmalis for many years, I can say with certainty that he is a most worthy recipient of this prestigious award. Dr. Sirmalis has served our nation and our Navy admirably during a distinguished career. Widely recognized as the Navy's foremost authority on undersea weapons systems, Dr. Sirmalis has helped bring about improvements in methodologies for developing and testing undersea warfare (USW) systems and components. In particular, John has implemented a program to identify submarine technology opportunities for the year 2010, leading the Navy to shift its focus from traditional antisubmarine warfare to find responses to new and more complex military threats. 
Dr. Sirmalis' outstanding work at NUWC/Newport has contributed to the evolution of a facility that is widely recognized as a center of excellence within the Navy and the Department of Defense (DoD). NUWC has consistently sustained a high level of technical productivity, as it has become a leader in the use of commercial-off-the-shelf components and open system architecture. These attributes are today more important than ever at a Defense Department that is greatly constrained by tight budgets. 
It was certainly no surprise to me that during the defense base realignment and closure (BRAC) process, NUWC/Newport was designated one of the Navy's four principal research `mega-centers.' I look forward to NUWC/Newport continuing to maintain its important contribution to our national security under the leadership of Dr. Sirmalis. So my heartiest congratulations to John Sirmalis on receiving the Distinguished Executive Award. All Americans are well-served by the outstanding performance of this genuine public servant.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on May 2nd, twenty outstanding students from Central Falls High School in Rhode Island will visit Washington to compete in the national finals of the `We The People . . . The Citizen And The Constitution' program. In fact, this is the second time that the Central Falls High School team has won the statewide competition! 
For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with it, the `We The People . . . The Citizen And The Constitution' program is among the most extensive educational programs in the country focusing on citizenship. The program was developed specifically to ensure that young people understand the history and philosophy of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition simulates a congressional hearing in which students are given the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on historical and contemporary constitutional issues. 
Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the `We The People . . . The Citizen And The Constitution' program provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain an informed perspective on the significance of the U.S. Constitution and its place in our history. It is heartwarming to see young Rhode Islanders taking such an active and participatory interest in public affairs. 
I am very proud of Rodolfo Alvarez, Paula Arango, Viviana Blandon, Liana Breton, Angela Cano, Elizabeth Carmona, Jessica Carmona, Nicole Duguay, Arabella Garzon, Jennifer Kelley, Suzanne Krupka, Kathleen Lopes, Gina Matuszek, Nicole Mercado, Richard Oliveira, Patricia Pina, Shelly Rua, Amanda Ryfa, Giovann Restrepo, Melisa Sylvestre, and Melissa Weber for making it to the national finals. I applaud this terrific group of young men and women for their hard work and perseverance. Also, Mr, President, I want to congratulate Bert Brousseau, a fine teacher who deserves so much credit for guiding the Central Falls High School team to the national finals. 
On Tuesday, April 7th I was pleased to visit the Central Falls winners. I couldn't resist giving them a spontaneous oral quiz. I am happy to report that they responded to my questions superbly! Congratulations to Mr. Brousseau and his students for what they have already achieved, and best of luck in the final competition. These students, with the guidance of Mr. Brousseau, have learned what our nation is all about and what countless men and women have fought and died to protect. No matter what the outcome of the contest is, they have each earned the greatest prize of all: Knowledge.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to express my opposition to the measure we are about to vote on, H.R. 1757, the State Department Authorization conference report. Despite the fact that this bill contains many provisions which I support, such as a wide-ranging reform package that would ensure U.S. payment of dues to the United Nations, the entire measure is overshadowed by an egregious and misguided abortion provision included at the insistence of those who oppose abortion rights. 
This provision would prohibit foreign organizations from receiving U.S. family planning funds if that organization, with its own funds, provides legal abortion services or advocates on abortion issues in its own country. Such providers, for example, would lose their U.S. funds if they discussed at a conference that more than 20 percent of all maternal deaths throughout Latin America and the Caribbean are due to illegal abortion. 
In my view, this provision is a thinly-veiled attempt to further erode our commitment to international family planning programs. I must say, Mr. President, I am always perplexed by those who oppose family planning and also oppose abortion. Study after study has shown that lack of family planning leads to more unintended pregnancies which leads to more abortions. Consider two countries: Russia has very little contraception available, and abortion is the primary method of birth control. The average Russian woman has at least four abortions in her lifetime! Alternatively, Hungary has made family planning services more widely available and the abortion rate has dropped dramatically. 
The impact these family planning programs have on the health and well-being of women and children around the world cannot be denied. But there is another issue here that should not be overlooked--the important role population programs play in sustaining the global environment. 
The earth now supports 5.7 billion human beings. In thirty years it is estimated the world's population will be 8.3 billion. We are growing by 86 million people per year. It is expected that 90 percent of this increase will be in the developing world. India has to feed an additional 16 million people per year. And so many of these people are children--forty percent of the population of the average less-developed nation is under the age of 15. 
Mr. President, the United States plays a critical role in providing family planning services abroad. I feel strongly that we should continue our leadership role in this area. It is both humane and environmentally sound. This conference report contains provisions that would gut our commitment to international family planning, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor the Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998 with my distinguished colleague from Maine. I want to applaud Senator Collins' efforts to correct a provision in the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 which has had the effect of penalizing those home health agencies that have taken the lead in becoming more cost-efficient over the last several years. 
The Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998 will help avert the potentially devastating effect of the Interim Payment System (IPS), established by the Balanced Budget Act, on many home health agencies in Rhode Island, and throughout the country. 
The IPS for Medicare home health services that was established by the BBA bases its reimbursement in large part on agency-specific costs during fiscal year 1994. Consequently, home health agencies that had already been implementing cost-efficient practices at that time, like many agencies in Rhode Island were doing, are now finding their reimbursements greatly reduced. 
Home health agencies in my home state have told me that this decreased reimbursement, in addition to being unfair, might lead to reductions in critical health services that currently enable elderly patients to maintain their dignity and quality of life. These agencies also have pointed out that this interim payment system may well result in a loss of jobs in the home health industry. 
I am greatly troubled by the thought that the IPS now in effect may well put into financial jeopardy those Rhode Island home health agencies that have been working diligently to heed our appeal to deliver cost-efficient services. The impact of this payment system on one of Rhode Island's most vulnerable populations, the infirm elderly, is unpredictable and potentially devastating. 
The Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998 bases Medicare reimbursement for home health services primarily on national costs during the baseline year rather than agency-specific costs. Consequently, the most efficient home health agencies will not be placed at financial disadvantage. This is a matter of economic necessity--we will never be able to maintain the financial security of the Medicare program unless we encourage everyone involved in the system to help make it work. 
This bill is budget-neutral and will not increase overall Medicare expenditures. The legislation is a big step forward in our goal of a cost-efficient and reliable health care system for our older citizens. 
Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting the Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I join the two distinguished Senators from Maine in paying tribute to the remarkable job that Senator George Mitchell did in Ireland. 
Senator Mitchell would be the first to say that success is not assured and that this is but the first step in a long, difficult process. But because of what Senator Mitchell did, the chances for peace have been greatly improved. And it truly was an extraordinary job, as the two Senators from Maine have outlined. 
What patience George Mitchell showed, and what skills as a negotiator he displayed. 
I join in the sentiment that has been expressed that his success there comes as no great surprise to those of us who knew him well. I served in this Senate for the entire time that George Mitchell was here as Senator from Maine. I had the privilege of serving in not one but two committees, the Finance Committee and the Environment Committee, with George Mitchell. 
Indeed, as soon as he came to the Senate, he went on the Environment Committee, and there I saw the tremendous abilities that he had. I can remember particularly the Clean Air Act, that George Mitchell was the one most responsible for the reauthorization of that act, which occurred when George Mitchell was majority leader. Because of the guidance that he gave to all of us, that extraordinary reauthorization took place. 
I personally have deep ties to the State of Maine. My father was born in Maine. I have spent childhood summers there and adult summers likewise. So I am very familiar with that State. I might point out that although Maine is large in size, it has a relatively small population, about 1 million people. It is true that Maine is a very large State; it is as large as the rest of New England put together; but, as I said, it has a relatively small population. 
Yet from that relatively small population of 1 million people have come a series of extraordinary Senators. I look back, Mr. President, just in the ones I have had the privilege of knowing--Margaret Chase Smith, for example, who stands out as a beacon, particularly in connection with the impeachment hearings and leading up to that of President Nixon. We remember clearly Ed Muskie, with whom I had the privilege of serving on the floor of the Senate. He was active, ran for Vice President, and gave one of the finest television speeches it has been my privilege to hear. And George Mitchell, whom we have just had the privilege of extolling, and rightfully so. And Bill Cohen, who is now our Secretary of Defense. And that great tradition of those outstanding Senators is carried on now by the two Senators from Maine, Senator Olympia Snowe and Senator Susan Collins. 
It seems to me that the people of the State of Maine have great reason to be extremely proud not only of the Senators who have been before--and I listed some of them--but of their current Senators, Senators Snowe and Collins. It is a tradition that they are carrying on. It is a remarkable one, Mr. President. As I thought about these remarks today and thought of the Senators I have known, I don't think you could name a State that is as small in population as the State of Maine and has produced such outstanding Senators as those I just listed. 
Mr. President, in making this salute to George Mitchell, it seems to me we are saluting the people of the State of Maine, who have had such good judgment. These are not all Republicans, and they are not all Democrats. They are Republicans and they are Democrats, both. It has been a remarkable flow of outstanding servants, not just for the State of Maine but for the United States of America. I think all of us can be very proud of those who have gone before and those who are now serving in the U.S. Senate from the State of Maine. 
I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on Good Friday a landmark agreement was reached in Northern Ireland to start down the road to bring to an end decades of violent hostilities, and reshape fundamentally the political institutions of that province. All Americans have reason to be very pleased that the many competing political factions in Northern Ireland were able to resolve their longstanding, bitter disagreements. 
Today I want to express my particular appreciation of the splendid efforts of President Clinton's Special Advisor on Ireland, former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. It comes as no surprise to me that those closest to these negotiations believe that were it not for the tireless efforts of Senator Mitchell, this agreement would not have been reached. Having worked with Senator Mitchell for nearly fifteen years on many complex issues, I can certainly attest to his unique ability to forge an agreement that most thought unachievable. 
Senator Mitchell's many fine attributes served him well in the U.S. Senate, and helped prepare him for the tremendous challenges he faced as chairman of the multi-party talks in Northern Ireland: 
He has the patience to listen to the contentions of people whose differences have existed for some three hundred years. Twenty-two months of talks may well have worn out a less capable, less disciplined person. 
Senator Mitchell also brought with him to Belfast the Senate's respect for full and fair debate. As chairman of these talks, he ensured that all voices at the table were permitted to speak. He knew well that in the end, a successful agreement required that all parties felt that they had been listened to. 
He possesses unrivaled negotiating skills. When needed, Senator Mitchell called upon Prime Ministers Blair of Great Britain and Ahern of Ireland, as well as President Clinton, in order to urge the participants to keep the talks alive. He also had the strategic thinking to set a deadline to end the talks. 
Senator Mitchell was persistent in bringing about this agreement. Despite the long odds, he never gave up in his core belief that newborn children in Northern Ireland deserve the same chance as his six-month-old son to have peace, stability and reconciliation. 
Finally, Senator Mitchell believed in compromise. Unionists and nationalists were clearly far apart when these talks began, as they had been for decades. Senator Mitchell was able to forge an agreement that gave just enough to both sides so that each could declare victory. Indeed, this ability to bridge differences helped create our very nation, as our Founding Fathers crafted a Constitution that satisfied the big states--that sought representation by population--and the small states, that sought representation by states. 
Mr. President, George Mitchell's accomplishment in Northern Ireland makes us all very proud of him and proud of American values and ideals. In announcing the Good Friday Agreement, he stated, `it doesn't take courage to shoot a policeman in the back of the head, or to murder an unarmed taxi driver. What takes courage is to compete in the arena of democracy as these men and women are tonight.' 
Senator Mitchell knows the value of this competition of ideas from his days in this institution. He recognizes that a government which upholds this competition of ideas serves its people best. The people of Northern Ireland have recognized this basic truth as well. We salute George Mitchell, a true statesman who has helped begin the end of one of the world's most intractable conflicts.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this week the Senate has been debating a proposal that would enable families to invest in tax exempt savings accounts. The funds from these savings accounts could be used for educational expenses from kindergarten through college, including the cost of tuition at private and religious schools. 
I voted against this proposal in the Finance Committee, and I intend to vote against it today. If the President vetoes this bill, I will vote to sustain his veto. 
At first blush, this proposal sounds appealing. Why shouldn't parents be encouraged to save for their children's education? The problem is that the `encouragement' the proposal would provide, costs more than $1.6 billion over 10 years and, according to the Treasury Department, 70 percent of the benefits go to the richest 20% of Americans. That is money that would be better spent on improving public schools, particularly low-income, urban schools where most of the problems exist. Also, it permits families to use funds from these tax-exempt accounts to pay for tuition at private and religious schools. Doing so would mean that the federal government is subsidizing private and religious education. 
I believe that the Federal role in education must be to support public schools. Nearly 90% of students attend public schools. Our nation's public schools are required to take children who come to school at any time of the year, children with disabilities, children whose primary language is not English, children with disciplinary problems, and children with low IQs. 
Private schools have the ability to select the smartest and the least difficult students, with the fewest challenges to overcome. Families who send their children to private schools typically come from higher income levels, yet it is these families who would receive the greatest benefits from education savings accounts. 
There have been a number of amendments to this bill. Some of the amendments that I opposed have merit, and I would like to take a moment to explain my reasons for voting against them. 
Senator Moseley-Braun offered an amendment that would have provided tax incentives to help pay for school construction. Although her amendment failed, Senator Moseley-Braun has been very successful in making us all aware of the deteriorating conditions of our nation's school facilities. I voted against her amendment because I believe her approach 
would be very difficult for the IRS to administer, and I have concerns about using Superfund taxes as an offset. 
Senator Gorton offered an amendment, and, although I have serious concerns about its effect, he has highlighted an important problem with federal education funding. I share his view that states should have some flexibility in spending federal education funds. They should be able to target these funds to schools with the greatest needs, but I don't agree that $10 billion should be given to the states in block grants without the appropriate committees holding a single hearing. Also, the Commissioner of Education in my state had very serious concerns about the impact of this amendment. Next year, when the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is up for reauthorization, I hope that consideration is given to Senator Gorton's point of view and that appropriate hearings are held. 
I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Murray's desire to encourage smaller class sizes, particularly in the primary grades. In fact, in 1987, I introduced a bill that would have created a demonstration program on small class sizes. Regrettably, the Labor Committee never held hearings on my bill. I voted against Senator Murray's amendment because I am concerned about providing short term federal support for hiring new teachers. How would the school districts pay to keep 100,000 new teachers after the federal funding expired? This is a question posed by representatives from local school committees in Rhode Island when they visited my office earlier this year. 
Finally, I voted for Senator Ashcroft's amendment to prohibit federal funds from being used for national testing. Unlike many of my colleagues, I am not opposed to national testing. Parents should be able to compare their child's performance with children across the United States. Parents should be able to compare the performance of their child's school with schools across the state and throughout the nation. Nevertheless, I agree with Senator Ashcroft that it is Congress' responsibility to authorize a national testing program before federal funds can be used to implement such a program. 
Regardless of the outcome, we have had a good debate on a very important issue, namely the federal roll in education in America.

Mr. CHAFEE. I will take 30 seconds, and the Senator from Idaho will take 30 seconds. 
More than half of all the endangered species in the United States are in private lands. In the Endangered Species Reauthorization Act, we put in moneys, we provide for assistance to private landowners, most of them small landowners. We do that. 
The chairman of the Budget Committee provided that if any BLM lands are sold--if they are sold, those moneys, instead of going into the general treasury, will be used for the Endangered Species Act to help landowners, mostly small landowners.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the committee report accompanying the budget resolution includes a brief discussion of the Administration's so-called Climate Change Technology Initiative (CCTI) request for fiscal year 1999 and subsequent fiscal years. Specifically, the committee report states on page 22 that, `[s]ince the President has not submitted a treaty or plan to implement the reductions called for in the agreement [Kyoto Protocol], providing additional funding for these technology programs in the 1999 budget is premature.' The committee report goes on to state that, `[a]s a result, the resolution assumes last year's levels of $730 million for these technology programs and does not provide the increases requested by the President.' 
I am trying to understand the implication here. Setting aside the merit of the Administration's CCTI request, voluntary domestic activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including tax incentives and research funding for energy efficient technology and renewables, are consistent with the existing 1992 Rio Climate Treaty that the United States has already ratified. While some use economic arguments to oppose any form of government subsidy, prudent investment along these lines does not constitute regulation and is in no way a form of Kyoto Protocol implementation. 
Therefore, I ask my friend and colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, if he and other members of the Budget Committee are arguing in the committee report that we cannot take steps to try to increase energy efficiency and advance renewables unless and until the Senate provides its consent to the Kyoto Protocol?

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, over the course of the next month or two, the Senate will have the opportunity to debate how best to address the most significant, preventable public health problem confronting this nation today: the scourge of tobacco use by our young people. The Senate will face some difficult choices in this regard. The grim statistics about this epidemic, coupled with almost daily revelations of tobacco industry misdeeds, underscore the need for our earnest action. 
We can all agree, where adults are concerned personal responsibility must be the rule; tobacco is a legal product and adults are free to make that choice. However, the same level of independent judgment cannot be said where fourteen year-olds are concerned. Bear in mind, only one in ten smokers takes up smoking after the age of eighteen; the remainder start well before that stage. 
All of us--Democrats and Republicans--share a deep and abiding concern about this problem, and a recognition that now is the time for action. However, each of us has different thoughts on how best to attack this problem. The Commerce Committee draft bill offers a good beginning, but it must be strengthened. Senators Harkin, Graham and I believe that an aggressive, but responsible approach is essential if we are to be successful in reducing teen tobacco use. 
This is why the KIDS Act would force the price of cigarettes up by $1.50 over the course of two--not four, five or six--years. The price hike must be significant and rapid in order to affect the purchasing behavior of children; the evidence solidly favors that position. Simply put, a smaller increase of only $1.10 over a longer period of time--in effect 20 cents per year in the Commerce Committee draft--will not achieve the desired result. As a result of our aggressive approach on price, the KIDS Act would halve teen smoking within just three years! 
That is also why the KIDS Act contains very stiff so-called look-back' penalties if the industry fails to meet the annual youth reduction targets specified in our bill. Unlike the Commerce Committee draft, the KIDS Act emphasizes company-specific penalties to ensure that the companies who do the addicting take the hit. Additionally, our annual penalties are capped at $10 billion per year, as opposed to $3.5 billion in the Commerce Committee draft. These look-back penalties are the very heart of our efforts to curb youth tobacco use; if they miss the mark, the whole program is the weaker for it. 
This is also why the KIDS Act provides roughly $5.1 billion per year for anti-tobacco programs, including counteradvertising, school and community-based prevention and education programs, cessation and other initiatives. For those who think this is too much spending, we spend a lot more money on addressing other ills which kill far fewer than 400,000 Americans per year. 
Recognizing that the needs of each state are very different, the KIDS Act hands back $6 billion per year to the states in recognition of the costs and damages they have incurred in treating tobacco-related illnesses. Importantly, this funding could be used to meet the particular needs of 
 each state; flexibility is the key with respect to the use of this funding. One pool of $3 billion per year could be used to meet any need; the other pool of $3 billion takes the form of a health, human services and education block grant to meet virtually any human need. 
Our bill also includes a State Performance Bonus Pool to help incent and enlist states in the war against teen tobacco use, and we need all the stakeholders we can get! As a consequence of these provisions, the National Governors Association supports the state payment mechanism contained in the KIDS Act. 
Some have pointed out that the draft Commerce Committee bill incorporates the cap on annual liability payments included in our bill--although at $6.5 billion, not $8 billion. My response is that the cap cannot be examined in isolation from the other parts of the legislation. If, for example, the youth smoking provisions are not as tough as they should be, than I question the appropriateness of a liability cap. 
Now, some people have said our bill is too tough and could bankrupt the tobacco industry. Says who? The tobacco companies? I'm not sure we can rely upon their representations if past history is any judge. What about the securities analysts who understand the financial workings of the tobacco industry? Can we rely upon these individuals and firms when many of these same companies manage pension and mutual fund portfolios with significant investments in tobacco stocks? Frankly, I think the only reliable measure of what the industry can truly afford would be an independent audit--not an illogical request of an industry which seeks a virtually unprecedented deal with the federal government, the several states and the American people. 
The KIDS Act would require the industry to pass along in the price of its products an annual payment of $25 billion. Given discussions we have had with a variety of experts, both inside and outside the government, we do not believe the payment requirements in our bill would jeopardize the profitability or future viability of the tobacco industry. 
In closing, I urge my colleagues to examine the KIDS Act and to join with us in working to pass a strong, responsible tobacco bill as quickly as possible. We look forward to working with our respective Leaders, Senator McCain, and our colleagues toward that end.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I want to comment very briefly on an amendment of mine that has been accepted by the managers. My amendment deals with cost-sharing for a levee and waterway project included in the Supplemental Appropriations bill for Elba and Geneva, Alabama. Specifically, the amendment strikes the phrase, `to be conducted at full Federal expense' as found on page 17, lines 10 and 11 of the bill. 
By striking this phrase, the appropriate, lawful cost-sharing ratio would be applied. It would be my strong preference, Mr. President, that we not include any authorization for this or other water projects in the Supplemental bill. These are matters more appropriately dealt with in the Water Resources Development Act, which we plan to take up this summer. 
However, recognizing the urgency of the situation in these Alabama communities, I am willing to go forward with the expedited process provided here; as long as the cost-sharing is consistent with current water resources law. My amendment ensures that the levee repair and associated work in Elba and Geneva will be cost-shared. I want to thank Senator Shelby and the bill's managers for working with me today to favorably resolve this matter.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, yesterday, many in America honored St. Patrick--but all week long in Rhode Island--veneration belongs to the University of Rhode Island Rams basketball team. 
The so-called experts said it couldn't be done--and, admittedly, the odds were against them. After all, the little Rhodys of the world just aren't supposed to beat the college basketball powerhouses like the Jayhawks of Kansas. But somewhere along the way to Oklahoma City, someone forgot to tell that to the Rhode Island Rams. 
Someone forgot to tell Tyson Wheeler--the same Tyson Wheeler who was once told he was too short to play college basketball at all--that the Davids of Rhode Island couldn't beat the Goliaths of Kansas. 
Someone forgot to tell that to Cuttino Mobley, who always gives his best whether it is in Keaney Gym or in the national spotlight, that Rhode Island couldn't beat one of the best teams in the nation. 
And clearly, someone forgot to tell Antonio Reynolds-Dean and Luther Clay that they weren't supposed to be able to compete with the much taller and perhaps stronger inside presence of the Kansas All-Americans. 
There's a word on Rhode Island's state flag that these Rhode Island Rams have come to symbolize--that word is `Hope'. It's a sentiment we hold dear in my home state--and one which was displayed for all the world to see. We may be the smallest state, but we know that means: we must always try harder. It's a philosophy to always give your very best, and to never give up. 
That's the kind of fighting spirit that turns the cause of `Hope' on our flag into the action of `courage' on the court. 
Rhode Island's advance to the `Sweet Sixteen' provides a needed reminder that at one time or another, we've all been underdogs. Whether it be in schoolyard, or in the workplace, or on the basketball court, each and every one of us has faced seemingly insurmountable odds at one time or another in our lives. 
That's what makes Rhode Island's recent win over the Kansas Jayhawks that much sweeter. For the Rhode Island Rams have given us more than a wonderful basketball season. They've reminded us that the Davids can beat the Goliaths of this world. They have sent a signal to the underdog in all of us--that if one perseveres and gives one's best, there indeed is always hope. 
So, Madam President, I congratulate the Rhode Island Rams and applaud the example they have set. Rams Coach Jim Harrick and all of his players have earned a special place in the hearts of Rhode Island and the nation. 
I, along with the people of my state, am proud of their accomplishments. These fine young men have set an example which we'll treasure for years to come. 
They have given us `Hope.' Go Rams!

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today with my distinguished colleagues to introduce the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998. This bipartisan legislation addresses one of the most important global environmental issues today--the protection and preservation of tropical rain forests. 
Since 1950 the world has lost as much as half of its tropical forests, and the destruction is continuing unabated. The most comprehensive survey of global deforestation estimated that, last year alone, we lost more than 30 million acres of tropical rain forest--an area the size of the State of Washington. This is a devastating loss because of the potential biological impacts deforestation can have both regionally and globally. 
Tropical forests contain the world's richest stores of biological diversity, and their health is essential for life on Earth. Scientists estimate that more than 50 percent of the Earth's terrestrial biological diversity is contained within these forests, which account for less than 2 percent of the planet's land surface. Almost 40 percent of all terrestrial plants and at least 25 percent of terrestrial vertebrate species are endemic to these areas. That is, they are found no where else on Earth. Consider that in the Tropical Andes region alone, there are 320 species of endemic birds, 558 species of endemic reptiles and amphibians, and 20,000 species of endemic plants. Moreover, many of these species are found only in a small area of the forests. And as the forests are destroyed, Mr. President, the species are permanently lost through extinction. 
Tropical forests also function as carbon `sinks,' storing greenhouse gasses that could otherwise contribute to global climate change. While there are still many scientific uncertainties related to climate change, it is undeniable that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are rising rapidly. A significant number of scientists believe that humans have already influenced our global climate. In order to lessen the risks associated with this change, such as sea level rise, extreme weather conditions, and higher average temperatures, it is important that the United States join with other nations to take preventative action. Protecting our tropical rain forests, and thus preserving their vital function of reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is one such action. 
These forests are important to human health in other ways. They harbor many of the biological resources that are used in life-saving medicines, and provide the genetic sources to revitalize agricultural crops that supply most of the world's food. They significantly affect rainfall, and therefore the health of crops and coastal resources worldwide. 
Many of the world's tropical forests are located in developing countries that, since the international debt crisis of the 1970s, have been unable to repay loans to foreign lenders. These countries are in need of hard currency, and to come up with cash, they have resorted to exploiting their natural resources with little regard for environmental planning. Vast areas of tropical forests are destroyed each year for logging, agriculture and livestock operations. This trend will continue as debt continues to mount. 
Mr. President, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act would help turn the tide against this deforestation. This legislation builds upon President Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, or EAI. EAI created a system by which Latin American and Carribean governments could restructure some of their official debt to the United States, while channeling local currency into funds to support environmental and child development programs. 
Using so-called `debt-for-nature swaps,' EAI restructured bilateral debt to provide $154 million to environmental trust funds in Latin America. Under these swaps, a nation's debt is modified, rescheduled, or written off, in return for the borrower nation's commitment of its own currency towards local conservation. The legislation before us today would utilize this same principle, but would focus exclusively on tropical forest conservation and extend eligibility to include countries in Africa and Asia. 
The Tropical Forest Conservation Act would authorize $325 million over three years to be used for debt-for-nature swaps with developing countries that have forests with the greatest biodiversity and the highest risk of threat. The bill assists countries with tropical forests that are globally outstanding in terms of their biodiversity, and applies to any lesser developed country with tropical forests and qualified U.S. debt. The authorized amount would be used to compensate the Treasury Department for any revenues lost due to the restructuring of outstanding debt. 
This legislation gives the President authority to reduce debt owed to the United States as a result of any credit extended through specific loan programs. In exchange, the developing countries would establish funds in their local currency to preserve and restore tropical forests. To ensure accountability, funds shall be administered and overseen by U.S. Government officials, environmental nongovernmental organizations active in the beneficiary country, and scientific or academic organizations. 
To qualify for assistance, countries must meet the criteria established by Congress under EAI, including that the government must be democratically elected, has not provided support for acts of international terrorism, is not failing to cooperate on international narcotics control matters, and does not participate in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights. 
Mr. President, I believe this is an important bill that, if passed, will go a long way to helping protect some of the world's most ecologically sensitive and vital areas. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act promotes debt reduction, investment reforms, community based conservation, and sustainable use of the environment. It has the support of numerous environmental organizations, including Conservation International, the Nature Conservancy, and the World Wildlife Fund. I urge my colleagues here in the Senate to support the legislation as well.

Mr. President, from my visits to California, I have learned first hand how the traffic coming through the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles are expected to more than double by the year 2020 with 25% of all U.S. imports coming through these two ports. If we are to realize the benefits of this increased trade, we must improve the efficient movement of the cargo throughout this nation while at the same time taking every step to enhance the safety of the residents of the area and to improve the environment. 
The Senator should be assured that I will give this project every consideration as we move to final enactment of this bill.

I will say, that applies to every member of our committee. It is a committee that, indeed, does work together. It is a committee that reported this bill out not once, but twice, 18-0.

Also, Mr. President, like all cases, we could not ever have done this bill with all its complexities without the splendid staff--Jimmy Powell and Dan Corbett and Ann and everyone else who worked so hard in connection with resolving this.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted and, indeed, grateful that the Senate is about to conclude action on ISTEA II. I congratulate my colleagues for wrapping up this effort with such alacrity, rescuing us from a Saturday or even Sunday session, as the majority leader pointed out. He--and I agreed with him--was determined we were going to finish this bill, and we are finishing it way ahead of the outlying time. 
We have before us a very fine piece of legislation of which we can all be proud. It will truly bring our Nation's transportation system into the 21st century. It will do so with an unprecedented increase in funding, $214 billion over 6 years, for all surface transportation programs. That is the highway plus the transit money. 
That includes $171 billion for highways. This increase represents the Senate's understanding of the breadth of the needs of our infrastructure and our commitment to meeting these needs. 
One year ago, the Senate was very divided on the issue of how ISTEA II should look. Within the Committee on Environment and Public Works, of which I have the privilege of being chairman, we had not one, not two, but three very different proposals on what to do with this legislation, how to proceed, how to make the allotments amongst the various States. All of these proposals had merit, and the duty was to try to coalesce them into one unified plan. And we did so. 
Once ISTEA II reached the Senate floor, we had to address even more complex issues, such as funding, affirmative action, penalties on drunk driving, not to mention the countless highway- and transportation-related concerns which are inherent in this legislation. 
When it was enacted in 1991, ISTEA I transformed transportation policy in this Nation, what was once simply a highway program--if you had more requirements, you built more roads; needed more lanes, go ahead and build them. But the purpose of this national transportation program is not simply to build more roads; it is to move people and goods as efficiently, swiftly and safely as possible. 
I pay tribute to the splendid leadership that was given to us on that splendid legislation when it came out of the Environment Committee, on the floor and in the conference. Senator Patrick Moynihan from New York gave us that leadership. I am pleased that ISTEA II perpetuates the critical central ideals of ISTEA I passed in 1991--flexibility and efficiency and intermodalism. 
We ironed out in ISTEA II some of the problems that were apparent under ISTEA I. With the passage of ISTEA II, transportation policy will be even more responsive to the challenges of the new century. 
It contains provisions that address the infrastructure challenges of the new millennium, the new period we are going into. This legislation will endure into the first several years of that new millennium. 
There are exciting technological advances that are made in this legislation and innovative financing mechanisms. It redoubles our Nation's already strong commitment to the environmental health of our people and their safety. There are important measures that strengthen each of these areas. 
In the bill before us, we recognize we must reach out and be creative. First of all, ISTEA includes a number of innovative ways to finance transportation projects. It establishes a Federal credit assistance program for surface transportation. This new program leverages limited Federal funds by allowing up to a $10.6 billion Federal line of credit for transportation projects, at a cost to the Federal budget of just over half a billion dollars--$500 million. 
The bill expands and simplifies the State Infrastructure Bank Program to enable States to make the most of their transportation dollars. It includes a new program that will make it easier for the private sector to participate in financing transportation infrastructure. So that is the first big step--innovative financing. 
The second step recognizes the important role technology plays in an efficient transportation system. Transportation technologies offer a wide array of benefits. They relieve traffic congestion if you can spend money on coordinating your traffic lights, for example, not just building more lanes, but move the same amount of traffic or increase the amount of traffic in the same lanes in a swifter and safer fashion. That is what the technology innovations do. We strengthen the intelligent transportation systems, so-called ITS programs, which were established in the original ISTEA. We provide technologies that have new options to address safety and capacity concerns. 
Third, the bill before us significantly reforms ISTEA funding formulas. Now we are into the formula business. To balance the diverse regional needs of the Nation, we address the inequities that came about under ISTEA I. The bill before us addresses the tremendous infrastructure needs and terrible congestion problems of densely populated States such as California, New Jersey, and Illinois. And it strengthens the programs tailored to rural expanses in Federal lands in the West. 
Fourth, we provide real flexibility to localities and States and make the program easier to administer. In ISTEA I, there were five program categories. We reduce that to three, and that includes more than 20 improvements to reduce red tape. As valuable as transportation is to society, there is no question but these new roads and the automobiles and trucks that are on them have taken a tremendous toll on our Nation's air, land, and water. I am proud that ISTEA II builds on the original ISTEA efforts to preserve and protect the environment. 
In addition, what we do is to concentrate on the safety of drivers and passengers. In the United States, these figures are really shocking. More than 40,000 highway deaths occur every year. And just as troublesome and worrisome as that is, there are 3.5 million automobile crashes that occur each year. These do not--these do not--every one result in fatalities, obviously, but from these crashes come people who are terribly injured. And these injuries, in frequent cases, are detrimental to these individuals throughout the rest of their lives.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Budget Committee well knows, I am always opposed to taking these programs off budget. That is my position, and that is the position we will take going into conference. We have been treated very well by the Budget Committee in connection with this legislation. The Budget chairman has assumed some very onerous burdens to find the money for us to come up with this program. Certainly I don't think the answer is to take this trust fund off budget.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the amendment that I have submitted would assist seven States--Arizona, Indiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin. This assistance would be in addition to the increases already provided to these States in the Chafee amendment that the Senate adopted last week. 
The Chafee amendment provided allocations to the States in three categories--the Appalachian Regional Commission program, the density program, and the bonus program for donor States--to bring their minimum up to 91 cents on the dollar. Six of the seven States to be assisted by this proposal did not qualify for either the Appalachian Regional Commission program or the density program in the Chafee amendment. The other State--South Carolina--that would receive assistance under this proposal received only $1.4 million per year from the ARC program in the Chafee amendment. Thus, the proposal is to provide an additional amount to donor States that received no, or very little, money from the ARC and density programs in the Chafee amendment. 
The proposal is to take $70 million per year for 5 years--1999 through 2003--from the Federal research program and distribute that amount among the seven States. Thirty percent of the new funds would be distributed equally among the States--$3 million per State--and 70 percent would be distributed according to the share of payments to the trust fund in 1996. 
The States would be added to the density program, giving each State almost complete discretion in the use of the money. The research program is authorized at approximately $100 million per year in the underlying bill and would be reduced to approximately $30 million per year by the amendment.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, those remarks were well-phrased by the distinguished ranking member of the full committee. I also want to include in that `pit bull' category, Senator Abraham. He, also, was right there. They were a team. They dogged us every step of the way. 
So Senator Abraham and Senator Levin both did outstanding work in connection with this legislation. I look forward to a nice, friendly, telephone call from the Governor of Michigan saying what wonderful things we have done for Michigan.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted to be a cosponsor of this amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri. 
Now we all recognize trucks are essential to the Nation's economic health. There is no argument to that. But we believe allowing increasing the number of the larger trucks to operate on our highway is a dangerous way to increase productivity. Triple-trailer trucks impose, I believe, a triple threat to safety, to the environment, and to the highway infrastructure. 
This amendment is a sense of the Senate that we will stay as we are. That is what the underlying legislation does. It does not change what the States allow, or roads they are permitted to operate under now, and does not increase the ability to operate where they are not operating now. I am for that. 
I thank the Senator for his amendment.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Kansas worked hard on this, and we have worked with him. I am absolutely confident that everything is all set here. Meanwhile, nonetheless, there is a request that has been made, so we will have to defer to that. What I suggest to the Senator is, let's set his amendment aside, and as soon as things get cleared--which I think will be momentarily--we will go right back to it. 
Before we do that, I have several points of clarification on the amendment allowing for the disapproval, by the Surface Transportation Board, of a railbanking request at least half of the local jurisdictions through which the rail corridor proposed for railbanking affirmatively oppose the request. Will the Senator from Kansas confirm my understanding of his amendment?

Mr. CHAFEE. Thank you. First, although it is not explicitly referenced in the wording of the amendment whether its terms would apply to rail corridors that already are railbanked, and which already have been transferred from the railroad to the railbanking agency, it is my understanding that your amendment does not apply to corridors where a notice or certificate of interim trail use under section 1247(d) of title 23, United States Code, already has been issued by the Surface Transportation Board. The amendment only will be applied prospectively. Am I correct in my understanding?

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the purpose of the amendment offered by my colleague from Kansas is to provide clear opportunities for local input into the railbanking process where section 8(d) of the National Trails System Act is invoked. The National Trails System Act provides for the preservation of otherwise abandoned rail corridors through interim use as trails. In short, it has allowed railroads wishing to abandon a line to enter into a voluntary agreement with a trail-managing agency, to turn the abandoned right-of-way into a trail for bicycling, walking, snowmobiling, horseback riding and the like. 
Railbanking is a complex and sensitive issue that is in the jurisdiction of the Senate Energy and Commerce Committees. I am pleased that Senator Brownback has worked with the Chairman and ranking members of both of these committees and with the National Rails-to-Trails Conservancy to come to an agreement that does not limit the development of rail trails or detract from the good work done by the railbanking program.

Mr. CHAFEE. I congratulate the Senator from Kansas. He has been very, very patient. I think it was about last week I said to him, `You are next up.' Then problems arose and problems arose and we could not get to it. Each time I had to go to him and say, `We have to slip you back a little bit here.' But he was very patient and helpful although, indeed, tenacious. I congratulate him for his theory, which is a good one. The local folks should be consulted on these matters. He has worked it out. I am confident all the problems are taken care of. 
I say to the Senator, if he is not here when we get the approval, with his approval I will just go ahead and urge the adoption of the amendment and get it agreed to, if that is agreeable to him.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for my distinguished colleague from Florida, and I would like to point out several things, if I might, in connection with the repeal of the 4.3-cent gasoline tax. 
It seems to me that this is an amendment that is about 2 weeks late. As we have had pointed out here, about 10 days ago, maybe a little bit more, we were in a jam on this floor in connection with this so-called ISTEA II legislation. State after State was asking for more, and so, thus, then came the freeing up, if you would, through negotiations with the majority leader, the leader of the Budget Committee and others from both sides of the aisle, of this money, which started out at $18 billion and worked its way up to $25 billion. Because we had that extra money, we were able to achieve peace on the floor here, and we have adopted an amendment, which we just did a couple of hours ago, which we call the donor States amendment. As a result, the money has been spent. At least it has been allocated on the floor. 
If this amendment should pass, it then would unravel everything that we have accomplished in the last 2 weeks in this body. It would unravel the agreement we reached because there aren't additional funds to substitute for the 4.3 cents that we allocated. So I think it would be very unfortunate. Maybe if the amendment had been brought up, as I say, some 2 weeks ago and we then could say to everybody that there is no more, that is all there is, perhaps an agreement would have been reached. But I doubt it because sides were dug in pretty hard around here, and it was necessary for the majority leader to become involved and the Budget Committee chairman in order to extricate ourselves from that difficult situation. 
I want to raise one more point, Mr. President, and that is as follows. Every industrial nation in the world has far higher overall gasoline taxes than we have in this Nation. If you talk to any environmental group, they will say that gasoline taxes result in a reduction in miles traveled by automobiles. In other words, if somebody is encumbered by a gasoline tax, raising the cost of operating his or her vehicle, those people will be more cautious about using their vehicle, or else they will seek out vehicles that get far more miles per gallon than would otherwise be true. So a gasoline tax, no matter whether it's modest or very substantial, results in environmental improvements, lower emissions, obviously, and less global warming. 
So in a strange way that many of us haven't thought about, a vote to repeal the 4.3 cents would really be a vote against the environment and our efforts to reduce emissions in this country and our efforts to curb the global warming that is occurring. 
So, recognizing that both of my colleagues from Florida are very good environmentalists, I urge them to consider that measure when they rise to make their presentations. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to repeat the admonition the Senator from Virginia made for all those who wish to speak either for or against this amendment. Please come to the floor. I am not sure what the proponents of the amendment will do with their time. But as has been pointed out, we are anxious to move on with this legislation. 
Speaking just for our side, I hope that all those who wish to speak in opposition will come to the floor; here is your chance. The store is open for business. We are anxious to move on. If there are no speakers, the idea would be to close debate as soon as possible thereafter.

Mr. CHAFEE. I say to the Senator from Colorado that we are happy to pledge to him that we will strive in our work during the conference with the House to address the issue the Senator has raised. The House bill includes the provision he would have offered, so the issue will be in conference. The PM factor will be considered. 
The Senator from Colorado has raised a very good point. In some western cities transportation emissions are a principal source of fine particulates in the air. EPA has recently issued new standards for particulate matter that may require these cities to adopt transportation strategies to reach attainment. The CMAQ program in this highway bill is intended to help cities solve their transportation-related air quality problems. So I am happy to pledge to the Senator from Colorado that we will strive in our work during the conference with the House to address the issue he has raised. The House bill includes the provision he would have offered, so the issue will be in the conference and the PM factor could be included in the final formula for CMAQ funding. I want to stress though that we should only move in that direction where the particulate pollution problem is caused by transportation as opposed to stationary sources such as power plants.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to confirm the understanding of the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, that, in fact, wood composite research involving so-called wood FRP composites is eligible to compete for funding under those sections of the ISTEA II legislation that she mentioned. 
Furthermore, I want to confirm for the Senator that the Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Center at the University of Maine is eligible to apply for designation by the Federal Highway Administration as one of the four new national university transportation centers authorized by the ISTEA legislation as well. 
I understand there is a great deal of excitement about this new, emerging field of wood composite research. Certainly I believe that the Federal Government should be actively encouraging and providing funding for this innovative activity, which would be beneficial to rebuilding many of our bridges across our country. 
Mr. President, I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Collins during the committee conference on this matter, and I want to express my appreciation to her for her efforts in bringing this matter to my attention.

Having traveled a good deal in Vermont, I am familiar with these lovely covered bridges, but his amendment does not restrict the protection for the covered bridges to only his State. I think some 16 different States are involved with this amendment, and others beyond that, perhaps. 
As the pictures show, these are magnificent structures and really very unique engineering feats. We want to do everything we can to preserve them, and this is a modest step in that direction. I think it is a very worthwhile amendment to take.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we are here ready to do business on the so-called ISTEA II legislation. There are a host of amendments out there which we would like to have brought up; either present them, or consideration to see if we can accept them, work out something, or, if not, go to votes. 
But we are here to do business. The store is open. I very much hope that those who have amendments will bring them over. 
I must say, Mr. President, if people who say they have amendments do not bring amendments over, I lose sympathy for them if later on they say they have amendments and they want time and so forth. Now is the time when nothing else is interfering with the action. So I urge my colleagues who are listening to please bring their amendments over so that we can deal with them. 
Seeing nobody on the floor who wishes to present an amendment, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is an amendment, as I said, that I sent to the desk last Friday. It would require the Secretary of Transportation to reduce the amounts made available under the so-called ISTEA Act for fiscal year 1998 by the amounts made available under the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997, the so-called 6-month extension. 
Last year, Mr. President, as you recall, in the latter part of the calendar year, around October, the Senate passed a 6-month extension of the ISTEA legislation which allowed States to use their unobligated balances to fund eligible transportation projects. It also allocated an additional $5.5 billion in new money to the States. The Senate agreed to provide that $5.5 billion on the condition that the amounts allocated to the States under the ISTEA II legislation in fiscal year 1998 would be reduced by the amount each State received for the 6-month extension. In other words, under the legislation we are now considering, Mr. President, we provide money for the entire fiscal year of 1998. 
What this amendment would do is say the amounts we previously gave the States in October for this fiscal year will be deducted from the total amount that we provide for the entire fiscal year for them. By the way, Mr. President, the amounts would be allocated to each of the categories for which they had received that amount previously. For example, the amount each State will receive in the surface transportation program, so-called STP funds, under ISTEA II will be reduced by their portion of the more than $1 billion provided in STP funds for the 6-month extension. 
There are several reasons why this reduction is necessary. First of all, ISTEA II provides money for each fiscal year 1998 through 2003. It does not provide a half-year amount. If this reduction is not required and agreed to, the States would receive one and one-half times as much as they should for 1998 and our bill would be subject to a point of order. Second, the reduction ensures that each State will receive money based on the new formula provided in ISTEA II instead of the old formula, or amounts received in the past. 
We worked long and hard to update this formula to make it as fair as possible.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague, the ranking member of the committee, that he is exactly right. There are two big amendments out there, but neither of them have anything to do with our committee. One is from the Finance Committee dealing with the tax portions of this legislation, and the other from the Banking Committee dealing with the mass transit portions of this legislation. But both of those are in other committees. 
So we have been very anxious. The Finance Committee chairman and others have indicated that they are prepared to come to the floor. We started this at 1 p.m., and we keep hoping that they will come. We are losing valuable time, Mr. President. Obviously, both of us and all members of the committee want to finish this legislation. There are several hundred amendments still out there, but I have reason to believe very few of those are actually going to be presented. 
So, we could really make tremendous progress if we could dispose of those two major amendments--the one from the Banking Committee and the one from the Finance Committee, which we are expecting to have presented momentarily.

Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator is exactly right. That is my understanding. My understanding is they are ready to go. 
One of the most famous reports that one hears in the Senate is, so and so `is on his way.' `On his way' can mean a lot of things. It can mean circling Ronald Reagan Airport preparing to land, or it could just mean that he has gotten on the elevator and will be here within 45 seconds. So we have heard reports that the Finance Committee representatives who are going to present that amendment are on their way. Again, I am not sure what that exactly means.

Mr. CHAFEE. I say to the distinguished Senator that he is absolutely right. Without the money, this bill isn't going to amount to much. So we treat the members of the Finance Committee and the chairman with great deference since he provides the wherewithal to make this whole program fly. 
The amendment they will present will extend the highway 
trust fund taxes for 6 years. It will extend the highway trust fund expenditure authority for 6 years. It creates a 15-project pilot program dealing with tax-exempt bonds for private-public partnerships. It has a whole series of provisions that have been worked out in the Finance Committee. It is crucial to this legislation. 
So once we get that dealt with, which I certainly hope won't take long, we can then move on to the Banking Committee amendment. 
I have just heard through the grapevine that the Banking Committee amendment, which deals with mass transit, will be ready tomorrow. But, as everyone knows, there is a cloture vote coming up at 5 or 5:30. It would seem to me that they should get that Banking Committee amendment in, or there will be all kinds of problems should cloture be invoked since that would not be germane to the bill.

So I am very anxious to see that transit measure passed--the so-called `banking amendment.' So, I do not want to foreclose anybody. But I urge the managers of that legislation, as well as others who have amendments which they might want to present, to come on over. The store is open for business. Now is the time.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, this is what we might call a repeat offenders amendment. I filed it last Friday so that our Members would have a chance, and their staffs, to look at it and consider it. The amendment would strengthen and clarify the repeat drunk driving offenders section of the bill; that is, the underlying bill. 
The bill, as currently drafted, requires States to act and support penalties for drunk drivers who have a blood alcohol concentration of .15 or greater. And two things have to occur--the drunk driver is arrested, has a blood alcohol content of .15 or greater, and has been convicted of a second or third or more drunk driving offense within 5 years. 
This amendment, of which Senator DeWine is the lead sponsor, is cosponsored by Senator Lautenberg, Senator Warner, Senator Chafee, Senator Baucus, and Senator Dorgan. And what it does, it strikes the reference to the .15 blood alcohol concentration and lets the State law on blood alcohol concentration determine what is a `repeat offender.' 
The amendment, therefore, clarifies that a person who is arrested for driving with a blood alcohol concentration level lower than .15, such as .08 or .10, still may be classified as a repeat offender if the State so chooses. So, in essence, Madam President, what this amendment does, instead of our setting it at a Federal level, we let the States set the level for the second or greater offense that has occurred within the 5 years. 
Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, this is a package of amendments to the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, so-called TIFIA. These include two types of changes. First, they make technical and noncontroversial changes to the TIFIA subchapter. The majority were recommended by the U.S. Department of Transportation to improve and clarify provisions under this act. 
Second, this package establishes a fee for those States that use the Federal credit assistance to fund transportation projects under so-called TIFIA. This fee is necessary to offset the revenue loss that the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated will result in the program. It is important to note we have confirmation from the Congressional Budget Office that this fee will address the loss. 
I am pleased that TIFIA was included in the underlying bill, S. 1173, as it will assist the Nation in funding the gap between transportation resources and needs.

In his admiration for the efforts that the Senator from Kentucky is making to defend our Constitution, as he outlines, I hope we can enlist the support of the Senator from Texas against an amendment that is clearly against the Constitution and restricting efforts there, and that is the so-called `burning of the flag' amendment. We would be glad to have him sign up against that pernicious proposed addition--I hope it never passes here--in connection with the Constitution.

Mr. CHAFEE. I am delighted that he has had a roll call of heroes of the country, but before he leaves I would point out one thing. It is not often that he is inaccurate, but I am afraid that he went overboard a little bit today when he suggested that the Supreme Court in the Adarand decision had struck down as unconstitutional the provisions of the affirmative action program. What the Supreme Court said in the 5 to 4 decision--I am talking about the Supreme Court. I like to deal with the Supreme Court. What it did is remanded that case. It did not say it was unconstitutional. Any talk of unconstitutionality came by the lower court which then examined whether the provisions in the Adarand situation conformed to the restrictions that the Supreme Court was applying. 
I just want to say to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts--and by the way, I am on my time now, Mr. President--I think he is exactly right when he points out the difference between what happens when you have a State program with no admonitions in it, or requirements as far as minority contractors go, and what happens when you have the Federal program when the efforts are made. I might say these, the goals, are voluntary in the States. In Kentucky--I was pleased to see that Kentucky is considerably above the 10 percent. Kentucky itself is at 11.5 percent. In my own State, when we have the State programs with none of the Federal requirements in them--with the Federal requirements we are at 12.1 percent to minority contractors; when we do it with the State's money, we are at zero. That is my State, at zero when we deal with the State handing out its money. But when we deal with the Federal Government's requirements, then we go up to 12.1 percent. So it shows the difference that the Federal Government's requirements make. Therefore, I am very much in favor of the language that is currently in the law and am in opposition to the McConnell amendment. 
Again, I would point out to everybody, if those who are against these preferences want to come out with a bill that deals with it generically--as we pointed out before, there are some 60 different programs--bring it out on the floor and let's debate it. But let's not do it one by one in individual programs such as this, and particularly this one where we have, as I pointed out yesterday, a letter from the Secretary of Transportation saying that he could not recommend the President sign this measure if the McConnell amendment should pass.

Mr. CHAFEE. No. I want to report that we have not received complaints. Indeed, as I pointed out, my State has gone beyond the 10 percent. We are up to 12.1 percent. It is impressive how many States have gone considerably beyond. Our neighboring State, Connecticut, is at 15.7 percent. The suggestion that these are onerous restrictions that cause chaos amongst the States in dealing with these preferences just plain isn't true.

Mr. CHAFEE. Yes: it is. We have made it clear to the Secretary that while one can never predict with 100 percent certainty what language may pass constitutional muster, the Committee expects the Secretary and his legal staff to do their utmost to make sure that the new regulations closely follow the guidance set forth by the Court in Adarand.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have previously made clear my thoughts on this. 
I think the arguments have been very well made in connection with the opposition to this amendment. I strongly believe that the Congress should not interfere with the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program at this point. I don't think this is the appropriate time. 
As I have also pointed out several times, we have a letter from the Secretary of Transportation indicating that if this amendment should prevail, he would not be able to recommend that the President approve this legislation. What all that means, Mr. President, is that is a gentle way of saying he would recommend a veto. I suspect there would be a veto of this legislation. We have come a long way to try to get this legislation passed. I very much hope that it will not be subject to any kind of a veto threat, which would result if this amendment should pass. 
Mr. President, we are going to vote at 11 o'clock. We must be very close.

<TEXT>
Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I will send an amendment to the desk. I will not ask for its immediate consideration. This is an amendment that would require the Secretary of Transportation to reduce the amounts made available under the ISTEA of 1998 for the fiscal year 1998 by the amounts made available under the extension that we did last fall, the so-called 6-month extension bill. 
Now, last year, Mr. President, as you recall, the Senate passed a 6-month extension bill which allowed the States to use their unobligated balances to fund eligible transportation projects. The bill also allocated an additional $5.5 billion in new money to the States. 
As you remember, the ISTEA I expired on September 30 so we knew we were not going to be able to enact a new ISTEA bill-- indeed we have not enacted it yet--and that carried us over to May 1 of this year. In it we provided not only that States could use their unobtained balances but there was also allocated an additional $5.5 billion. 
The Senate agreed to provide this new $5.5 billion on the condition that the amounts allocated under ISTEA II in fiscal year 1998 would be reduced by the amount each State received under the 6-month extension. In other words, yes, we gave them additional money to carry them through during this extension, but when we enact a final bill, as I hope we will do next week, then the amounts that the States would have received would be deducted from the amounts that we provide for them for the fiscal year 1998. 
For example, the amount each State will receive in the surface transportation program, so-called STP funds, under ISTEA II will be reduced by their portion of the more than $1 billion provided in STP funds under the 6-month extension. 
Now, there are several reasons why this extension reduction is necessary. First of all, ISTEA II provides money for each fiscal year 1998 through 2003. It does not provide a half-year amount for 1998. If this reduction is not required, States would be receiving one-and-a-half times as much as they should for 1998. In other words, we give them the entire 1998 money in the bill, and we have also previously given them half of that so it doesn't make sense for them to have one-and-a-half times as much money for 1998 as required. Indeed, our bill would be subject to a point of order. 
Second, a reduction ensures that each State will receive money based on the new formula provided in ISTEA II instead of the old formula or amounts received in the past. We worked hard to bring this new formula up to date in order to make it fairer, and we believe we have achieved that. 
So, Mr. President, this technical and noncontroversial amendment has been cleared by both sides. We want to make sure that this amendment is available for any of the States who would choose to review it. They can get in touch with me and we will give them a copy, obviously. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have an amendment here on behalf of Senator DeWine. It is a repeat offenders amendment. 
This amendment would strengthen and clarify the repeat drunk-driving offenders section of the bill. The bill, as currently drafted, requires States to enact and support penalties for drunk drivers, who have a blood alcohol concentration of .15 or greater, and who have been convicted of a second or subsequent drunk-driving offense within 5 years. The DeWine-Lautenberg amendment strikes the reference to .15 blood alcohol concentration and allows the State law on blood alcohol concentration to determine what is a repeat offender. The amendment, therefore, clarifies that a person who is arrested for driving with a blood alcohol concentration level lower than .15 still may be classified as a repeat offender. 
Mr. President, I know there is a good deal of concern amongst our colleagues about these drunk-driving amendments and the penalties that occur. I will not seek to have this agreed to now. I will only file it. It will be my intention to call this amendment up Monday, thus, giving those who might have concerns an opportunity to review it. I think when they review it, they will find that it gives more power to the States than the underlying bill does. Nonetheless, because of the deep interest in this matter, I think it well for it to lie over.

Under a previous agreement, the Senate will conclude 90 minutes of debate on the pending McConnell amendment regarding contract preferences, with debate equally divided between the proponents and opponents, with 40 minutes of that time equally divided between Senators Chafee and Baucus. 
Also, as under the consent, at 11 a.m. the Senate will proceed to a vote on or in relation to the McConnell amendment. Following that vote, the Senate will continue to consider amendments to the ISTEA legislation. 
In addition, the Senate may also consider any legislative or executive business cleared for floor action. Therefore, additional votes are possible during today's session. An effort will be made to announce additional votes as soon as it can be determined when and if additional votes will take place. 
As a reminder to all Members, the first rollcall vote today will occur at 11 a.m.

If individuals have amendments, if they will bring them over and discuss them with us, we may be able to accept them, but we certainly will be able to give the proponent a place in line so we can move forward with getting this legislation disposed of. So, we are very, very anxious to get on with these amendments. Perhaps we can enter into time agreements, but at least we can move forward. There is a mass of amendments out there, and it is discouraging to be here with nothing going on, in a quorum call, when potentially those amendments could be taken up. 
I thank the Chair, and now the Senator from New Mexico is ready to go, and that is encouraging.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, like the Senator from New Mexico, I am disturbed by the incidents of alcohol-related injuries and fatalities on our highways, as we all are. I believe the Federal Government should support strong national safety standards for our roads and, indeed, I was a sponsor of the Lautenberg amendment. In our bill, we have provisions dealing with the so-called repeat offender. 
I am not sure the Senator's amendment is an appropriate solution to the problem of drunk driving. We cannot expect it to do everything, obviously. I have concerns about how much it will accomplish. It does place, as originally offered--there was a short time period. That has now been extended. Less than 22 of the States have such a law in effect. It will require them to pass this legislation by--the latest figure now is 2001. 
I am not sure whether such a sales ban would have an impact on alcohol-related deaths. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has no statistical information on the effectiveness of such a sales ban. Indeed, we have not considered this measure at all in our committee. 
It is a steep sanction, the 5 and the 10 percent. I think it is one we ought to approach with great caution. I must say, I am a little reluctant to have this bill too filled with sanctions. We have our provision in the bill already; namely, the one dealing with the repeat offender. We have the provision that was adopted in the Lautenberg-DeWine amendment. And then we have another amendment coming up from the Senator from North Dakota, which also has sanctions. I am just reluctant to get in too many sanctions, and the only way they can avoid these sanctions is for the State legislatures to take certain actions by a period, in this instance, by 2001. 
I think we are putting a lot on the backs of the State legislatures in a relatively short time. So I have concerns over that, Mr. President. 
If anybody wishes to speak in opposition to the amendment, now is the time. If not, I give that time to the proponents. If the Senator from New Mexico wishes to speak, he can take some time.

Mr. CHAFEE. Let me just say again, Mr. President, I am concerned about the number of sanctions we would be adding to the States under this. I have grave concern whether we might well have a backlash. We had a very solid vote on stern sanctions involved in the Lautenberg-DeWine amendment. There are sanctions in the underlying bill we have dealing with repeat offenders. There are sanctions in the legislation that the Senator from South Dakota is going to propose immediately. So I am worried that there could well be a backlash in the States and particularly, when we go to conference, that the attitude might be to just dispose of all of these sanctions. So that is the concern that I have. 
There being no others who wish to speak, I yield back the remainder of our time and am prepared to go to the Dorgan amendment at this time, unless the Senator from New Mexico has anything further to say.

<TEXT>
Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I rise in support of this amendment offered by my colleague from North Dakota. The terrible problem of drunk driving is certainly, as we all recognize, an issue of national importance. In 1996, more than 17,000 lives were lost on our Nation's highways as a result of alcohol-related collisions. This represents nearly half of all the fatalities that occur on our roads each year. 
The laws on how drinking and driving are treated vary from State to State. As mentioned previously, six States allow drivers to operate motor vehicles and drink alcohol at the same time. In over half of the States, even if a driver cannot drink, all the passengers in the vehicle can drink. 
Madam President, the sad thing is that drunk driving accidents are completely avoidable. There is not a single reason why the driver sitting behind the wheel of a car should be allowed to consume an alcoholic beverage. 
Now, Madam President, this isn't about freedom and States rights; it is about the rights of a driver against other drivers on the road. Shouldn't every individual have a right to travel safely on the highways? There is a lot of discussion here as to, `Oh, leave it up to each State.' Well, as we all know, in my State, you can go across the State in an hour and, clearly, you are either in Massachusetts or Connecticut very quickly. And so it is in most of the States. We travel from State to State freely. Very few people stay entirely within the borders of their own State all the time. 
So we have a right to know that when we go out of our 
State, if our State should adopt an amendment like this, we will be safe in the other States likewise. I believe the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota will save lives by keeping alcoholic beverages off the road. This is a workable and fair solution to the problem of open containers and the larger problem of drunk driving. 
Now, Madam President, we still have time in opposition to the Senator's amendment. But absent that, I would be glad to yield some of that time to the Senator from North Dakota, or whatever he chooses. We have previously committed to not go to a vote until 10:30. I would like to stick by that commitment, even though it might require some dead time here.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this amendment would allow funds that are allocated under the Surface Transportation Program to be used for programs to reduce motor vehicle emissions caused by extreme cold-start conditions. 
The problem is that in the northern States when cold weather comes, the starting of an engine is the highest emission point from the engine. Ninety percent of engine wear happens when the car is started. The engine wear in cold climate conditions is twice this amount. 
This amendment has been cleared by both sides. What it will do is permit these funds to be used for some kind of heaters that might be installed to warm up the catalytic converter or other aspects of the engine so that when it is started, it will not start cold and will not have the heavy emissions that occur absent some warming techniques.

I must say that I am thinking of, at quarter past, getting up and proposing--and that's 7 minutes from now--that all time after that be deducted from the proponents' side. Let's wait and see.

<TEXT>
Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have great affection for the Senator from Utah, but I don't greet his remarks with the enthusiasm that the Senator from Kentucky has. 
The truth of the matter, Mr. President, is that this is the wrong amendment, at the wrong time, in the wrong place. Why do I say this? This is a transportation bill that every single one of us in this Chamber knows is a very important and difficult bill. Trying to balance everybody's interest has been very, very difficult. There isn't a Senator in this place who doesn't know exactly how much his or her State was getting under ISTEA I, then how much under the first proposal of ISTEA II, and finally how much under these new proposals. And all of them want more. As I say, trying to satisfy all of these senators is very difficult. 
To come forward with an amendment like this doesn't help. It flies right in the face of an October 1997 letter sent to the majority leader by the Secretary of Transportation. In that letter, which was sent when we first brought up this bill last fall--and there have been no changes in his position since then--Secretary Slater talks about the President's view on this whole Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, or DBE, Program. He closed his letter by saying this:  
This critical effort to achieve equal opportunity must continue. Removal of the DBE program from S. 1173 would be a serious blow to our efforts to assure fundamental fairness to the citizens of this country. I would find it difficult to recommend ISTEA reauthorization legislation to the President for his signature that did not include the DBE program. 
This is a gentle way of saying, listen, folks, if you knock out the disadvantaged business enterprise section of S. 1173--which is exactly what the Senator from Kentucky is proposing to do--then there is going to be a veto of this legislation. 
I see the Senator from Utah here. If I could get his attention for a moment. Now, he spoke against the DBE provision of our bill. But my question is, why pick on the provision in our bill? It is my understanding that similar affirmative action language is contained in some 160 different federal statutes or regulations. The Senator from Utah chairs the Judiciary Committee--and certainly he is masterful in that role, with all the great powers that supposedly appertain to the chairmanship of a committee--and thus out of that committee comes legislation he wants and bottled up in that committee is legislation he doesn't want. I notice that the Senator from Utah now has before him, in his own committee, legislation to eliminate all federal affirmative action programs, not just this program. So I am asking him--don't pick on our little program here that we are desperately trying to get through. Imagine, here is an amendment that puts the whole bill under the threat of a veto if it is adopted. If the Senator wants 
to debate affirmative action at the federal level, I would say to him, go ahead and deal with that issue in your own committee. Don't pick on our program. I can't name all 160 federal affirmative action programs, but certainly there are Small Business Administration programs and many others that have special provisions for disadvantaged parties. 
So if the senator so wishes, go ahead and do a generic bill on eliminating affirmative action, and go ahead and have it out here on the floor. But I feel helpless here as you all come forward with a amendment like the one the senator from Kentucky has offered on our bill.

Mr. CHAFEE. Let me answer that quickly. There may be many arguments against the DBE, but I must say that your weakest one is this so-called unconstitutional argument. We all know about the constitutionality issue. In 1995, the Supreme Court handed down a decision in Adarand v. Pena. In Adarand, the justices specifically said that federal affirmative action programs are not unconstitutional. As long as the programs meet a compelling governmental interest and are narrowly tailored, then they can pass constitutional muster. Now, US District Judge Kane, to whom the case was remanded, ended up holding that part of the DOT regulations were unconstitutional on the grounds they were not narrowly tailored. But that is going to be corrected under the new regulations that are due out this spring. So as I say, of all your arguments, that really is the weakest. As a matter of fact, I will give you an opportunity to jettison that argument, if you want.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I haven't heard from the Senator from Utah, the distinguished chairman of the committee who has power over all these affirmative action programs. Why doesn't he go after all of them? That would be a rather magnificent effort. It certainly would shake things up. The senator could come to the Senate and try to get rid of all 160 different affirmative action programs. Why doesn't he do that instead of picking on the highway program? Go after all of them. There is a suggestion for you. I certainly would not support that effort, but I am saying that if you really want to get into an affirmative action debate, why you don't do that, through your committee.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from Illinois wishes to speak, and I will be very brief in commenting. 
I have listened to the learned Senator from Kentucky speak this afternoon. He spent a lot of time on the Adarand decision. The only thing we ought to stress about the Adarand decision is that the Adarand decision was a 5-4 decision that did not find that affirmative action is not possible to have in our country. Indeed, I will give you a couple of quotes from--I like to go to the Supreme Court. I am not big on district courts and circuit courts. Yes, they are nice, but I like to go to the top and see what the top people have to say. This is what Justice O'Connor said:  
It is not true that strict scrutiny is strict in theory but fatal in fact. Government is not disqualified from acting in response to the unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country. 
Later on, Justice O'Connor stated for the majority: 
When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within constitutional constraints if it satisfies the narrow tailoring test. 
So it can be done, and affirmative action is not unconstitutional. If that is the implication that is derived from the remarks of the Senator from Kentucky, I say it is just plain not accurate.

Under a previous consent agreement, the Senate will debate Senator Bingaman's amendment on liquor drive-throughs for 30 minutes, evenly divided, to be followed by an hour of debate, evenly divided, on the Dorgan amendment regarding open containers. 
At 10:30, the Senate will proceed to back-to-back votes, first on the Dorgan amendment and then on the Bingaman amendment. Following those votes, it is hoped the Senate will be able to adopt the funding amendment, the so-called Chafee amendment, and then begin consideration of the McConnell amendment regarding disadvantaged businesses. In addition, we hope to enter into a time agreement with respect to the McConnell amendment immediately following those two back-to-back votes. 
For the balance of the day, the Senate will continue to consider amendments to the so-called ISTEA legislation. Therefore, Members should anticipate rollcall votes into the evening. 
As a reminder to all Members, the first rollcall vote today will occur at about 10:30 a.m.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned over the high incidence of highway fatalities in our country that involve alcohol. 
In 1996, more than 17,000 lives were lost as a result of alcohol-related collisions out of the 40,000 deaths overall in our country. So that is about nearly half. I believe that this measure will help reduce that. 
I understand the views of the opponents who think that it should be left to the States. But when you have a small State such as mine where there are people who are constantly going into the neighboring States, back and forth, it seems to me that in order to make our highways safer, and which obviously involves out-of-Staters, a law such as this is necessary. So I support it, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, and from Ohio, Senator DeWine, in support of the amendment to strengthen drunk driving laws throughout the Nation. 
I am very concerned about the safety of our nation's highways. I am particularly troubled by the high incidence of highway motor vehicle injuries and fatalities involving alcohol. The statistics are truly alarming. In 1996, more than 17,000 lives were lost on our nation's highways as a result of alcohol-related collisions. This represents nearly half of the 40,000 fatalities that occur on U.S. highways every year. The real tragedy, however, is that drunk driving accidents are completely avoidable. 
This amendment would strengthen drunk driving laws across the country and dramatically reduce the number of fatalities attributable to driving while intoxicated. The amendment specifically targets those states that have not enacted a .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) drunk driving law. 
In 1997, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a report entitled `Setting Limits, Saving lives: The Case for .08 BAC Laws.' The report cited studies which indicate that virtually all drivers, regardless of skill, are significantly impaired at the .08 BAC level. At that level, basic driving skills such as braking, steering and speed control, as well as judgment, reaction time, and focused attention are adversely affected. 
Contrary to the claims of those who oppose this amendment, the .08 standard does not punish social drinking. To exceed the .08 limit, one would need to consume an excessive amount of alcohol. The NHTSA report includes an example. In order to exceed the .08 BAC level, a 170 pound male would need to consume more than four drinks in an hour, while a 137-pound woman would need to consume three drinks, the report indicates. 
Despite these statistics, 35 states still maintain the higher .10 standard before someone is considered legally drunk--and that puts many lives at risk. Drunk drivers not only risk their own lives, but the lives of every other motorist on the road. The .08 level is a sensible approach to preventing senseless tragedies on our nation's roadways. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Thank you. 
Mr. President, I know the Senator from Oklahoma would like some time. And the opponents have 10 minutes?

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, yesterday, the Committee on Environment and Public Works held an important meeting on the pending business before the Senate; namely, the underlying legislation, S. 1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997. During yesterday's business meeting, the committee agreed unanimously, the 18 members of the committee voted 18-0, to adopt an amendment to S. 1173, which will provide an additional $25.9 billion for the Nation's highway programs over the next 5 years. The additional funds will bring the total authorization for highways in the bill to $171 billion. 
As I mentioned last Thursday in my opening statement on ISTEA II, which is how we will refer to the underlying legislation, the majority leader, Senator Lott, and Senators Domenici, D'Amato, Byrd, Gramm, Warner, Baucus, and I have been working to try to resolve the difficult issue of how much additional funding should be directed to transportation. We have participated in a challenging but ultimately productive set of meetings. Although I am not an advocate of spending the 4.3 cents gasoline tax on highways, I believe that the agreement we reached is a fair one that will allow the Senate to complete its work on ISTEA in a timely fashion. 
The principal question on everyone's mind is how this additional funding will be allocated among the 50 States and various ISTEA programs. I am pleased that the amendment before us distributes the new money in a manner that is responsible to all States and to all regions of the country. Moreover, the committee amendment does not affect the allocations or program structure in the underlying ISTEA II bill. The lion's share of the additional funds, $18.9 billion, goes to all 50 States in the same proportion as the formulas under S. 1173. 
Before we proceed, I want to outline the package adopted by the committee yesterday. To make the bill fairer, the committee amendment provides additional funds for those States that did not fare as well as the majority of the States in S. 1173. 
First of all, this amendment does address the inequities of the so-called donor States, those States that contribute more money to the highway trust fund than they receive from the Federal aid highway program. The underlying bill, S. 1173, as reported, guaranteed that each State would receive at least 90 cents in return for every dollar allocated to the States from the trust fund. The amendment before us includes an additional $1.9 billion over the life of the bill to ensure that each State receives at least 91 cents in return. 
Now, the States that will benefit from this donor State bonus are the following: Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin. These States have complete flexibility to use the additional funds for any purpose authorized under title 23, which is the Federal aid highway title of the U.S. Code. That is the first thing we did. 
Second, there are a number of densely populated States, such as California, Illinois, and New Jersey, where high volumes of traffic clog the roads and high repair costs impede routine maintenance. The committee amendment provides an additional $1.8 billion over the next 5 years for these high-density States. The additional funds may be spent for any purpose authorized under title 23 to relieve the terrible congestion problems and address tremendous infrastructure needs. 
Those States which are neither donor States nor high-density States also may spend a percentage, 22 percent, of the additional funds they receive pursuant to this amendment for any purpose authorized under title 23. 
The committee amendment also provides additional funds for those ISTEA programs directed to regions of the country with unique needs. For instance, the Appalachian Development Highway System was first authorized in law in 1965, but is not yet completed. The committee amendment provides an additional $1.89 billion for the Appalachian Highway Program for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 to help complete the 3,025 mile system. 
Second, as a result of the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and other key trade agreements, states along the Mexican and Canadian borders have experienced a substantial increase in truck traffic. The increased traffic and congestion along these routes has put a heavy burden on the corridors that connect border locations and other ports of entry. The committee amendment provides $450 million over the next five years in contract authority for the nation's border infrastructure and trade corridors. 
Third, the roads that run through the nation's parks, Indian reservations, and other public lands are in great need of maintenance and repair. The committee amendment provides an additional $850 million over 5 years for the Federal Lands Highway Program. 
This is in addition to the money that was included in the bill originally as we submitted it. 
Of the $850 million total, the committee amendment provides $50 million per year for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 to help address the mounting needs of the nation's 49,000 miles of Indian reservation roads. An additional $50 million per year for the next 5 years, is provided for the Public Lands Highway Program, which funds Forest Service roads and other public roads that run through federal lands. 
The remaining $350 million in the Federal Lands portion of the committee amendment is directed to the Park Roads and Park Ways Program. An integral part of our National Parks System is the 8,000 miles of park roads and parkways that make the splendor of these national treasures accessible to all Americans. Fifty million dollars of the $70 million annually for the Park Roads and Parkways Program is directed to these roads that run through our national park system. 
The remaining $20 million per year is set-aside to address the backlog of needs for the roads in our National Wildlife Refuge System. I am delighted that the committee has agreed to include this additional funding for the 4,250 miles of refuge roads within the system. Indeed, the National Wildlife Refuge System, which is administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service, plays a pivotal role in the conservation of fish and wildlife resources throughout the country. The additional funds provided in the committee amendment will allow the Service to better focus its appropriations on the core mission of protecting fish and wildlife and their habitats. 
Mr. President, before closing, I want to thank all of the members of the committee for their diligence and cooperation in adopting the amendment before us. 
I see Senator Warner here, who has been a very valuable ally and originator, actually, of much that is in this legislation. 
I thank them all for their diligence and cooperation in adopting the amendment before us. I thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, who presided over the negotiations in which we arrived at this compromise; Senator Byrd, Senator Warner, whom I previously mentioned, Senator Baucus, the ranking member of the full committee, who has been so helpful, Senator Gramm, and particularly Senator Domenici. All I thank for their determination and resolve during our discussions. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support the amendment before us so we can proceed to the business at hand and enact an ISTEA II bill which will bring the Nation's transportation system into the next century. 
I thank the Chair.  
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, we spent a good deal of time this afternoon without any action on the floor, in quorum calls. We want very much to get on with this bill. People ought to bring over their amendments. If they have problems--as you know, we are just dealing solely with the so-called Chafee amendment, which is the major amendment dealing with the increased financing for a whole series of programs. I see no reason why we should not go to a vote. No one has brought over any amendments. Nobody is proposing anything here on the floor. We have worked out the ones who have. We have worked them out. Others say they are going to get together. They may be along. It is all very indefinite. I see no reason why at a quarter of 3 we should not have a vote. 
So, Mr. President, that is the tilt I have, because I want to get on with this bill. There are other lengthy amendments after this. This is not the last amendment by a long shot. There are other amendments that we have to consider. We have one involving disadvantaged business enterprises and a whole series of others. There are some 100-plus amendments out there. Clearly, hopefully, they are not all going to be brought up, but we ought to get on with this. If people have problems, come on over here.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment which has been offered by my colleague who is the chairman of the Clean Air Subcommittee of the Environment Committee. He has identified some important concerns about the implementation of the recently revised so-called National Ambient Air Quality Standards. 
This is a very complicated area. The Senator from Oklahoma has invested a good deal of time and energy studying this and educating our committee about it. His subcommittee, as he mentioned, held seven hearings on the subject here in Washington and another in Oklahoma. He and his staff led the sometimes difficult negotiations on this amendment to, as he noted, a successful conclusion. 
I want to applaud the Senator from Oklahoma for his efforts both on this amendment and on the larger issue of the NAAQs rule. He has invested a great deal of energy and time in studying this complicated matter and educating the Environment and Public Works Committee about it. His subcommittee held seven hearings on the issue here in Washington, and another in Oklahoma. He and his staff led the sometimes difficult negotiations on this amendment to a successful conclusion. His efforts and patience have served us all well because the amendment before us will improve the implementation of the NAAQs. 
This amendment seeks to ensure that commitments made last year about how the standards would be implemented are upheld. The Environmental Protection Agency said it would cover 100 percent of the costs associated with installing and operating the new monitors needed to measure fine particulate matter. Having made the promise, the federal government must ensure that it is kept. This amendment would do that. 
The amendment would also require three years of data collection before planning starts for additional pollution controls. The EPA has decided that it needs three years of data to ensure that chronic sources of particulate matter are accurately identified. Complete data will enable states to develop appropriate control strategies. Reducing PM 2.5 is important to the public health but we must be sure that new controls are used where they are needed. Without sufficient monitoring data, we will not be certain the right sources are targeted for controls, and we may not achieve the improved air quality or the health benefits that we are seeking. 
Along the same lines, we need to be sure we can chemically distinguish one type of particulate from another. That is the only way State air officials will know if they need to reduce pollution from wood stoves or power plants. This amendment requires a field study of the monitors to ensure that they are serving this purpose effectively. 
The EPA promised the States that they would have both the resources and the information necessary to implement the NAAQs rule. Through this amendment, the Senator from Oklahoma is attempting to enforce those commitments. 
All of the goals of this amendment are worthy and reasonable and I urge everyone to support it. 
Essentially what the amendment does is the following: There have to be monitors set up to measure particulate matter and ozone levels and other matter. The question is, Who is going to pay for these monitors? Is it going to be the Federal Government? The Administrator indicated it would be the Federal Government, but there seems to be some backing off from that. 
The amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma says that the Environmental Protection Agency would cover 100 percent of the costs of installation. You have to install these things and operate them. You have to go out and check these new monitors to measure the fine particulate matter. 
That is the first thing the Senator has accomplished in this amendment. That is a very welcome provision because the State budgets are having trouble keeping up with the requirements of the Clean Air Act. 
The other part of his amendment would codify the requirement under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. That calls for 3 years of data collection before there can be a designation of nonattainment for this particular part of so-called particulate matter. 
So, the EPA has decided that 3 years of data are necessary to ensure that chronic sources of particulate matter are accurately identified. As I understand the amendment of the Senator, it requires 3 years. Am I correct?

Mr. CHAFEE. This amendment by the junior Senator from Alaska is in connection with State infrastructure banks. This amendment restores the so-called sliding scale matching rate for States having large amounts of federally owned land. Under the current State Infrastructure Bank Pilot Program, such States may provide a smaller non-Federal match for Federal contributions of capitalizing grants.

Mr. CHAFEE. The major amendment we have been on since 10:30 this morning, what you might call the so-called Chafee amendment, has been tied up with some difficulties. We have not been able to move to a vote on that. We have set it aside to take up other matters. At this time, I would like very much if we could take up the Dorgan amendment, if that is possible. If that is not possible, and that will take an hour, we would soon be able to alert people whether we will be able to do that or not. 
Absent that, and even in addition to that, there would be an amendment of about a half an hour by the junior Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman. If the Dorgan amendment is not available to take up, then it would be my suggestion we go directly to the Bingaman amendment, which would take a half hour. 
So it is possible that we would have some votes--a vote at somewhere around 6 o'clock. As you can note from my statement here, there are some `ifs' involved in all this. I am doing the best I can to keep our fellow Senators alerted to what the situation is.

Mr. CHAFEE. I say further, what we would like to do is to dispose of the underlying amendment, that is the amendment before us, the so-called Chafee amendment. If we cannot do it tonight--and I see problems with that--certainly do it the first thing in the morning. Then we would go to the McConnell amendment on disadvantaged business enterprises. He has indicated he would be ready. Actually, I told him we were going to do that this afternoon, so my predictions are not totally accurate on what we are taking up and what we might take up. 
But we are doing the best we can. That is a major amendment and will take some time. We would certainly like to get to that amendment as soon as we can. The key thing is to dispose of the so-called Chafee amendment as soon as we can.

Mr. CHAFEE. Now, Mr. President, we have the so-called Lautenberg amendment that we would like to take up. This is the amendment that deals with the alcohol content in blood. The amendment would lower the alcohol content, which is a test, for drunken driving, from .1 to .08. 
Mr. President, we would like to enter into a time agreement on this. The time agreement would be something in the neighborhood of an hour and a half apiece. And now is the time for those Senators to come to the Chamber if, one, they object to this time agreement, and, two, the plan, further, would be that we would vote this evening. In other words, that would take us up to about 6:30, if all the time were used. 
So I want to send the word out, we are about to enter into this agreement. I trust offices are listening to what we are saying here and will come on over or call the cloakroom with their views because we want to move on. 
We have legislation we have to make progress on. We have been on this floor for some time but now we are ready for this particular amendment, the drinking amendment, which most people are familiar with.

Mr. CHAFEE. Well, I certainly agree with the distinguished ranking member. Senator McConnell has been very thoughtful. He has been on the floor. He is ready to go. We want to find out how many people want to speak on Senator McConnell's amendment so we can get some concept of the time that should be set aside. But that is another amendment. 
My thinking now is, if we can work out proceeding with the Lautenberg amendment, tomorrow morning we would take up the financing amendment that was agreed to in the committee today as a result of the agreement that was reached yesterday. There may be some debate on that. I do not know. But we are free to take that up tomorrow. 
My hope is we would do that tomorrow morning. And then tomorrow afternoon we would go to the McConnell amendment. But the Senator from Kentucky legitimately wants to know how many people want to speak on his amendment. We want a time agreement. He wants a time agreement. I am for a time agreement, enthusiastically for a time agreement. 
So, therefore, would individuals who want to speak on the McConnell amendment call up the cloakroom, let us know how long they think they need, 
and which side they will be on so we can figure that out. The same goes with the Lautenberg amendment. 
Time is of the essence. We will reach an agreement pretty quickly on the Lautenberg amendment. Now is the time for people to call with their thoughts. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<DOCNO>105-chafee-ri-15-19980303</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. CHAFEE. Then we would like to go to a vote. At that time I will move to table. We will have a rollcall vote at that time, Mr. President. 
Now, Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota would be timely if the Finance Committee were now considering a welfare bill. The matter before the Senate, the basic underlying bill, is a highway bill, financing for highways. 
The amendment of the Senator from Minnesota deals with welfare and accounting for those welfare recipients who have gone off the rolls, how have they succeeded and what has become of them. That is all well and good. But that has nothing to do with highways. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I have urged the Senator to attach it to a different bill or withdraw it. I tried to stress to him that what we want to do today is consider bills that deal with the subject before us; namely, highways, their funding, how to build them, and different ideas connected therewith. 
If the Finance Committee were debating a welfare bill, the amendment would be germane. But we would also oppose it even under those conditions because it is costly and unnecessary. 
Now, when Congress passed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996--that was only 18 months ago--one of the important features of that legislation was a commitment to find out whether the sweeping changes were effective in helping the families get off welfare dependency. What we had before us was a welfare bill. In it we had some provisions to ascertain, to do research on how the bill was working out. Congress appropriated about $44 million a year to conduct research on the benefits, the effects, the costs of the State programs that were funded under this new law. This new law was a radical departure from the way business had been done in the past. Furthermore, we were provided money to study the costs of the State programs funded under the new law and to evaluate innovative programs they might have. 
Now, is the impact of welfare reform being studied? One of the points the Senator from Minnesota makes is that this is a subject worthy of study. Our point, Mr. President, is that it is being studied. HHS, Health and Human Services, has awarded grants to conduct rigorous evaluations of State programs including a 5-year comparative study of the Minnesota Work First Program. In the Senator's own State a study is taking place. There are also studies on child care and child welfare being conducted by organizations such as the Urban Institute of Columbia University and Harvard. 
Now, under the Welfare Act, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services is required to make an annual report to Congress on whether the States are increasing employment and earnings of needy families, and are they increasing child support? 
I think the child support was one of the points that the Senator mentioned. The report that is required from the Secretary of HHS, the annual report, has to include progress on decreasing out-of-wedlock pregnancies, how are we doing on child poverty, reducing that. It is to include demographic and financial characteristics of families applying for assistance, the families receiving assistance, and families that become ineligible for assistance. I know the Senator is particularly concerned about the effectiveness of employment programs. He mentioned that in his amendment. 
The Welfare Act requires a specific study on moving families out of welfare through employment. That is already required. It requires an annual ranking of the States in terms of the most and the least successful work programs. The new $1 billion high-performance bonus program will reward States which are successful in increasing earnings for welfare families. 
Beginning in 1999, just a year from now, the Secretary is required to conduct an annual report on a broader set of indicators, including whether or not children and families have health insurance, the average income of these families, and educational attainment of these families. Thanks to the efforts of Senator Moynihan, Congress now receives an annual report. It is called Indicators of Welfare Dependence. It has a wealth of information. Mr. President, here is a copy of the report. This is no light-weight work. It is filled with graphs and percentages of children, age 0 to 5 in 1982, living in poverty by number of years in poverty; percentage of individuals living in poverty by numbers of years in poverty. On and on it goes. It has average monthly AFDC benefits by family and recipients in current and constant dollars. It is a very, very thorough report. 
Now, my concern is that States have been developing and implementing data collection systems for more than a year now. For Congress to suddenly impose, as the Senator's amendment does, new requirements for more information to track all former welfare recipients is a major undertaking and something we should not enter into lightly. The impact on States is likely to be costly and burdensome. 
The Senator's amendment is good news for computer and data processing vendors, but it is unlikely to mean anything, I suspect, for families and our efforts to combat welfare dependency. The amendment also calls for a report which may give an inaccurate picture about the lives of individuals who enter and leave the welfare system. 
Now, the accent of the Senator's amendment is on employment. Employment is an important reason that families find economic self-sufficiently, no question, but it is not the only reason. Families leave welfare because child support is being collected for the first time. They will leave because their children will have health insurance and no longer need take a risk of having their children without health insurance if their earnings are increased. 
Mr. President, these are the reasons that I find the amendment well meaning but unnecessary, particularly in view of the massive amount of reports that are already being required, one of which I briefly indicated.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as I mentioned before, we are dealing with a highway bill here. This isn't the appropriate place for that. When we did the welfare bill, I was the one who included in the welfare bill data collection provisions. Should those data collection provisions be inadequate and need to be expanded along the lines the Senator has suggested, I would be glad to work with him and see if we could not include those by working with the Secretary of HHS. This, plainly, isn't the right place for this amendment. 
If the Senator has nothing further, I move to table the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota and ask for the yeas and nays.

I further ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour remaining, equally divided, for debate. In other words, do 2 hours tonight and 1 hour tomorrow. The leader has indicated that we are to come in at 9 a.m. and that the vote will be at 10 a.m.; at 10 a.m., the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the Lautenberg amendment.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today is the eighth annual National Sportsmanship Day--a day designated to promote ethics, integrity, and character in athletics. I am pleased to say that National Sportsmanship Day was a creation of Mr. Daniel E. Doyle, Jr., Executive Director of the Institute for International Sport at the University of Rhode Island. Participation this year will include over 10,000 schools in all 50 states and more than 100 countries. 
Today, the Institute is holding a day-long town meeting in which athletes, coaches, journalists, students, and educators are engaged in an in-depth discussion of racial issues in sports. I believe that the Institute's work in addressing the issues of character and sportsmanship, and its ability to foster good dialogue among our young people is significant. 
As part of the Day's celebration, the Institute selects Sports Ethics Fellows who have demonstrated `highly ethical behavior in athletics and society.' Past recipients have included: Kirby Puckett, former Minnesota Twins outfielder and 10-time All Star; Joan Benoit Samuelson, gold medalist in the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984; and Joe Paterno, longtime head football coach at Penn State University. This year, the Institute will honor over 15 individuals including Mills Lane, district court judge of Reno, Nevada and internationally known professional boxing referee; Bud Greenspan, renowned Olympic cinematographer; Billy Packer, CBS sports commentator; and Ken Dryden, president and general manager, Toronto Maple Leafs. 
Another key component of National Sportsmanship Day is the Student-Athlete Outreach Program. This program encourages high schools and colleges to send talented student-athletes to local elementary and middle schools to promote good sportsmanship and serve as positive role models. These students help young people build self-esteem, respect for physical fitness, and an appreciation for the value of teamwork. 
If all those activities were not enough, the Institute has found another avenue to promote understanding and good character for youngsters. A new program called Renaissance Education was instituted in 1996 to expose students to the foundations of `total education.' The Renaissance Education concept gives students the opportunity to contribute to a team effort and profit from the benefits of team participation. To kick-off this program, the Institute will host its first-ever Renaissance Games in April where students will participate in sports, leisure, cultural, and academic activities such as: basketball, volleyball, photography, public speaking, creative writing, chess, board games, spelling bees, and library research. 
I remain very proud that National Sportsmanship Day was initiated in Rhode Island, and I applaud the students and teachers who are participating in the events of this inspiring day. Likewise, I congratulate all of those at the University of Rhode Island's Institute for International Sport, whose hard work and dedication over the last eight years have made this program so successful. 
Mr. President, it is my understanding that S. 1173 will be the matter before the Senate?

What we would like to do, if it is agreeable with him, is he could present his amendment and discuss it but we not proceed to a vote until we have had an opportunity to check with the Labor Committee, and check some other factors. So he and I could work together on when would be a good time to call it up for a vote.

Under the consent agreement, the Senate will conclude 1 hour of debate on the Lautenberg amendment regarding drinking levels, with time equally divided, with a vote occurring on or in relation to the Lautenberg amendment at approximately 10:30 a.m. Therefore, Members should be prepared for the first rollcall vote tomorrow at 10:30. 
Following that vote, the Senate will continue to consider amendments to the ISTEA legislation. I hope at least two of the major amendments to this legislation can be offered and debated during Wednesday's session of the Senate. Members should therefore anticipate a busy voting day tomorrow. I certainly hope it will be a busy voting day tomorrow.

I have looked over this amendment, and it's an amendment, obviously, that is in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, as the Senator from Minnesota has indicated. And the amendment has just been introduced, so, obviously, there have been no hearings before the Finance Committee, and it's not a matter that has previously been considered by the Finance Committee, if I understand this correctly. I ask the Senator from Minnesota if that is accurate.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I note that this is a piece of legislation that would direct the Secretary to develop a plan. In other words, as I read page 2 here, it says the Secretary shall develop a plan, 
to the extent possible based on all available information, and so forth. 
What I would like to do, Mr. President, is hear from our people on the Finance Committee, which should be very shortly, and I will then see that the Senator from Minnesota has every opportunity to bring this to a vote, should he wish to, this afternoon. We will work it out. He is not going to be blocked in any fashion. But I would like to hear, and it may well be that we can accept the amendment, and that would save us all some time. 
We are now just trying to check with the Finance Committee. It may be well that something from the Labor Committee is involved likewise, although it seems to me that this is pretty much a Finance Committee matter. When we get back, after our luncheon recess has concluded, I will speak to the Senator from Minnesota, and we will then be able to go from there.

The Senator from Wyoming is a very valuable member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. He has worked with us. As he pointed out, he had one of the major bills that went into the final amalgamation we had here--the STAR bill. And he had deep concerns, as he has outlined here, in certain particular areas. I am glad that we were able to take care of those areas. 
Indeed, when we meet tomorrow, I believe we will be, as I pointed out to the Senate a little earlier, able to do even better in some of those particular areas he is concerned with. So our committee will be meeting tomorrow at 9:30. And I look forward to working with the Senator from Wyoming as we proceed with an amendment incorporating some of the provisions that have come about as a result of the additional money that has come forward just in the last--well, just agreed to earlier this afternoon. So, again, I thank the Senator.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from Texas for his hard work in connection with this highway legislation. He was right when he said that it was his efforts that brought what was considered the 4.3-cent gasoline tax, that then went in the general fund, into the highway trust fund. 
I have to confess that I was not an enthusiastic supporter of that effort, but I can certainly see the rationale behind it. The Senator had the votes and, as I recall, won that vote rather overwhelmingly. 
The Senator has been intensely interested in the situation that not only affects his State but a series of States leading to the border, the additional traffic that has been generated by a program I was for, he was for and that I believe has been a great benefit overall for our country but has been very difficult on his State and some of the neighboring States, and that is the so-called NAFTA truckloads, where these trucks are rumbling down into Mexico and from Mexico up into the United States carrying goods, which was the whole objective of what we sought when we passed the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
The distinguished senior Senator from Texas has worked very hard to provide some extra money to take care of those roads that are taking an incredible pounding from the NAFTA trucks. In the agreement that we have reached, we have provided, as a result of the pressing of the Senator from Texas, some $450 million, which we will be presenting to the committee tomorrow, and it is my hope and belief that the committee will approve that additional money. 
I tip my hat to the Senator from Texas. He is a veritable bulldog in connection with these matters. When he and the senior Senator from West Virginia team up, it is a formidable aggregation. I salute both of them. As a matter of fact, they came away with everything they sought. But in the agreement that we reached, they made some concessions to other programs that they might not have been too enthusiastic about. So the whole thing was a compromise. All of us had to give, and I think the result is a good one for our country. 
What will happen next, Madam President? I and the distinguished ranking member of the Environment Committee will take this to our committee tomorrow. We are both for it. We will be salesmen for it. We are not just messengers; we are salesmen for this program. The staffs have met and appear to be enthusiastic about what we are undertaking here. We look forward to our meeting tomorrow. If all goes well, we could report it out, and then I believe that we cannot bring up financial matters until Wednesday, that is, amendments that deal with financial matters to this bill. But that can be changed, and we can, hopefully, bring up this amendment that the Senator from Texas was discussing.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I salute the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia for the tremendous work he did in connection with this, not only just the Appalachian regional highway portion of this bill but the overall bill. 
As the Senator mentioned, he was in on all the negotiations and pressed forward to conclusion. He outlined vigorously the needs of, and I don't want to say just West Virginia, because West Virginia is just part of the Appalachian region, he stressed the needs for all the Appalachian regional area and prevailed. I salute him for the work he did. 
If he can fit it in, I would like to be asked down to the dedication of one of those roads. 
I have never seen them, to tell you the truth. I think I will go down and take a look. I have heard about them.

And he carried out those responsibilities. I felt very strongly allied with him in connection with those efforts, and I think what we came out with was a satisfactory solution. Are all of us totally satisfied? Of course not. But we are totally satisfied that the end result was as good as we could get under the pressing problems we are faced with. So I am going away happy and hope that the Senator from New Mexico is likewise. 
I also want to join his tribute to the majority leader. The majority leader was the one who got us in there and actually proposed the final compromise that we agreed to. So he deserves a lot of credit for moving us along.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I have seen those jams down there. I have seen them in California by Tijuana. The trucks were all lined up. It is incredible. I saw a little bit of it in Texas, but that was just a sampling of what later has occurred as the NAFTA agreement has come into full flower with the jam-ups on both sides of the border, trucks trying to come across, customs inspectors trying to do their job. It truly is 
tremendously congested. 
Both Senators from Texas are absolutely right in addressing this problem.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senator from Missouri is here. It is my understanding that he has an amendment he is prepared to present. I would just use this opportunity, before we start on the Senator's amendment, to urge all Senators to come with amendments. 
We are ready to do business here. There are a host of amendments. As we know, under the ground rules, we are not taking up amendments that deal with financial matters, but there are a whole host of other amendments that do not deal with those particular subjects. We would certainly like to dispose of them. So I do urge all Senators who have amendments to come to the floor and bring them up. 
I thank the Chair. 
Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Missouri for this amendment. It is an excellent one. What it will do is have a wetland of a larger size than would be under normal conditions. When they do damage to a wetland, they create a new wetland next to the highway. To have it in the so-called mitigation bank is a far superior way of operating, and I commend the Senator. 
The amendment will improve the mitigation that is done to offset the loss and degradation of wetlands as a result of highway projects. We have suffered unacceptable wetlands losses--more than half of the estimated 220 million acres that existed when the nation was founded have been lost. 
Transportation has unintended but negative consequences on the nation's wetlands. The original ISTEA recognized this by establishing wetlands mitigation as an eligible expense of a State's highway construction funds. Mitigation banking is an innovative concept that allows a person who wishes to fill a wetlands to compensate for that loss by obtaining credits representing positive wetlands function generated at a nearby site. It is the perfect example of a forward-looking environmental policy that offers more bang for the buck. 
With respect to highway construction, mitigation banking offers several potential advantages over on-site, individual mitigation. A mitigation bank, unlike on-site mitigation, can consolidate wetlands compensation where it is most ecologically beneficial. Moreover, mitigation banking helps to achieve the goal of `no net loss' of the Nation's wetlands by providing additional opportunities to compensate for impacted wetlands. So I thank Senators Bond and Breaux again for their work on this. 
We are prepared to accept the amendment.  
Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Idaho for his thoughtful comments. He started his comments by saying 
that this is a matter to which many of the Senators have not given very thorough consideration, and I think that is accurate. I certainly fall into that category. 
I am not on either of the major committees that deal with the expansion of NATO. Like all Senators, I am busy with this or that. It seems to me very wise that we all give this matter some thorough consideration. It is my understanding that the majority leader is anxious to bring up the NATO expansion legislation quite soon. 
I just want to say, speaking for just this Senator, I certainly haven't concentrated on it. I look forward to reading the op-ed piece--I believe it was an op-ed piece--that Senator Baker and others worked on. 
All I can say is, I am grateful for the comments that the Senator from Idaho made, because it is wise for all of us--I personally haven't made up my mind on this. I am astonished that I haven't been lobbied, not that my vote is a key vote on it, but on this matter, the former Senator from New Hampshire came by to see me. He is very concerned. I am speaking of Senator Humphrey, a former Senator from New Hampshire. He is very concerned about the expansion of NATO. I think he presented some good arguments on it. Perhaps he has also spoken with the Senator from Idaho. 
Again, I thank the Senator for his thoughts.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the majority leader has outlined or stated clearly what the situation is. We are going to now proceed with the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998. 
I have a statement. I suspect that the distinguished ranking member will have a statement. Then we want to get on with amendments. 
The amendments that are available to consider today, tomorrow, and early next week will be amendments that are not relative to funding or financing. Funding and financing matters are now being worked out between various participants in that matter. So we will not touch on allotments or matters like that. But there is a whole series of amendments. There are some 200 amendments that have been filed, and a whole series of them have nothing to do with either financing or funding. 
So I hope that the authors of those amendments will bring them over, and let's debate them. If we can get a time agreement, three cheers, and get the vote. We have a lot of work to do. I just hate to have matters pile up toward the end. The majority leader has indicated he is very anxious to complete this legislation. I join in that desire. 
Mr. President, at long last, the Senate will begin its consideration of the `Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998,' which will be referred to constantly on this floor as ISTEA or ISTEA II. This legislation is the product of more than a year of hard work and careful negotiations in the face of tremendous obstacles. 
At this time last year, the Committee on Environment and Public Works had before us three different very good proposals. But they were different. We were able to integrate them into one unified plan that I believe is deserving of the entire Congress' support. 
I might say, Mr. President, that this bill was reported out of the committee unanimously--18 to nothing. Democrats and Republicans all supported it. 
When ISTEA was enacted in 1991--that is, ISTEA I, the original bill--it transformed national transportation policy. What was once simply a highway program is now a surface transportation program. That is the name of the bill. It is the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. That is what it is. It isn't just a highway bill; it is a surface transportation bill. 
We recognize that transportation touches every facet of our lives. The transition from the old policies and practices to those embodied in ISTEA I wasn't easy, and as for S. 1173, ISTEA II, it will carry forward the strengths of ISTEA I. But it also corrects some weaknesses that were in that legislation. And it will provide a responsive and, I believe, responsibly financed transportation program.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I support the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. 
Under the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, labor unions and corporations would be prohibited from spending soft money--what 
is soft money? That is the unregulated and unreported money that falls outside of current law--on advertising that mentions the name of a candidate in the 60-day period before an election. 
Now, labor unions and corporations would be permitted--some say, `Oh, you are muzzling the labor unions and corporations;' well, that is just not so--they can use their PAC dollars, so-called hard money, on electioneering ads or express advocacy. 
So there is no muzzling of any of these organizations. No restrictions are placed on the first amendment rights of organizations either. That is another point that has been raised here on the floor. Organizations still will be permitted to run ads that directly advocate for the election or defeat of a candidate. Electioneering ads discuss a candidate's record in relation to issues and they still will be able to run pure issue ads. 
Under Snowe-Jeffords, the only change is these organizations will be required to file disclosure statements. I do not see how anybody around here can be against disclosure. Disclosure statements will let the electorate know who is paying for what ads. I think that is what the public ought to know. How can that be objectionable? It is disheartening for me to hear other Senators object to disclosure. In my view, disclosure is at the very heart of reform. 
Last year, I filed an amendment that would have required even broader disclosure requirements. My amendment would have required all entities who mention the name of a candidate during the calendar year of the election to file a disclosure statement with the FEC. 
The Snowe-Jeffords amendment is a more modest approach. It simply requires entities to disclose their large donors and their spending during the 60 days before the election. 
Again, let me say, Mr. President, I find it very difficult to understand why anybody would object to the disclosure. If these organizations engage in issue advocacy rather than electioneering, that is, the ad discusses an issue without mentioning a candidate, they now have to disclose either their members or their spending. 
Now, the paramount goals of any true effort to reform the system of financing elections for Federal office must be to reduce the influence of special money on elected officials and to level the playing field between incumbents and challengers. 
Although the proposals before us may not be the final resolution of these problems, they provide a better starting point than we have had in previous years. 
As far as I am concerned, Mr. President, the most important problem to be addressed by campaign finance reform is one that barely existed a few years ago. Not too many years ago many of us were here debating election process and election reforms. What were we talking about? We were talking about PACs, about political action committees. How much should they be able to contribute? Was $5,000 right or wrong per election? 
Those are things we debated. We worried that these PAC contributions might appear to give special interests too much influence. But the soft money explosion made those amounts seem like pocket change. I believe that if all else fails we must deal with the soft money problem. 
As I said, Mr. President, once again the Senate is debating the question of how to reform the manner in which elections for federal office are financed. This year, progress has been made on the issue, and the Snowe-Jeffords amendment is an illustration of that progress. 
Senators Snowe and Jeffords have worked closely with experts in constitutional law to develop an amendment that would greatly improve the underlying McCain-Feingold bill. This amendment, which I am pleased to cosponsor, eliminates the vagueness and overstretching of the McCain-Feingold bill with regard to the treatment of bogus issue ads. 
The Snowe-Jeffords amendment creates a new category under the Federal Election Campaign Act called `electioneering.' This is a carefully defined category that pertains to the abundance of soft money spending by unions, corporations, and non-profits that was so proliferous in the 1996 elections. The Snowe-Jeffords amendment would not prevent these groups from letting their voices be heard. It simply would require them to adhere to the spirit of the law. 
There certainly is little effort to adhere to the spirit of the law. That's what the hearings before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee were all about. Week after week witnesses appeared and defended blatantly inappropriate behavior by pointing out that the law didn't quite cover their particular activity. The standard operating procedure in elections these days is circumventing the letter of the law. We are here to try to tighten up current law to make it harder for unions, corporations, and others to circumvent the law. 
Under Snowe-Jeffords, labor unions and corporations would be prohibited from spending soft money--that is the unregulated and unreported money that falls outside of current law--on advertising that mentions the name of a candidate in the 60 day period before an election. Labor unions and corporations would be permitted to use their PAC dollars, or hard money, on electioneering ads or on express advocacy. There is no muzzling of those organizations. 
No restrictions are placed on the First Amendment rights of organizations either. Organizations still will be permitted to run ads that directly advocate for the election or defeat of a candidate; electioneering ads that discuss a candidate's record in relation to issues; and they will still be able to run pure issue ads. Under 
Snowe-Jeffords the only change is that these organizations will be required to file disclosure statements. Disclosure statements will let the electorate know who is paying for what ads. How can that be objectionable? I have been quite disheartened to hear other Senators object to disclosure. 
In my view, disclosure is at the very heart of reform. Last year, I filed an amendment that would have required even broader disclosure requirements. My amendment would have required all entities, who mention the name of a candidate during the calendar year of the election, to file disclosure statements with the Federal Election Commission. The Snowe-Jeffords amendment is a more modest approach to disclosure. It simply requires entities to disclose their large donors and their spending during the sixty days prior to the election. 
If these organizations engage in issue advocacy, rather than electioneering--that is, the ad discusses an issue without mentioning a candidate--they need not disclose either their spending or their members. 
The paramount goals of any true effort to reform the system of financing elections for federal office must be to reduce the influence of special interest money on elected officials and to level the playing field between incumbents and challengers. Although the proposals before us may not be the final resolution to the problems that afflict the current system of campaign fundraising, they provide a better starting point than we have had in previous years. 
As far as I am concerned, the most important problem to be addressed by campaign finance reform is one that barely existed a few years ago, the explosion of soft money in the process. Not too many years ago, many of us were here debating whether PACs, political action committees, should be able to contribute $5,000 per candidate, per election. We worried that these PAC contributions might appear to give special interests too much influence. But the soft money explosion has made those amounts seem like pocket change. I believe that if all else fails, we must deal with the soft money problem. Just to make clear what soft money is: it is funds spent to influence an election that fall outside of current law. Spending on bogus issue ads--ads that are defined under Snowe-Jeffords as electioneering--is soft money. The Senate has the opportunity to make these important changes in the current fundraising system by approving the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. CHAFEE. 
Mr. President, I am proud to introduce a bill to reauthorize the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA), a law that has played a major role in conservation of wetland habitats across this continent. I am joined by many members of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. 
This tremendous showing of bipartisan support is nothing less than a celebration of one of the great success stories in wildlife conservation. This is a story about the recovery of more than 30 species of ducks, geese, and other waterfowl and migratory birds from their lowest population numbers just 12 years ago, to some of their highest population numbers this year. 
To appreciate why NAWCA is such a success, it is necessary to review its background. In the early 1980s populations of duck and other waterfowl plummeted precipitously. The numbers were stark: between the 1970s and 1985, breeding populations of ducks dropped an average of 31 percent, with some species declining by as much as 61 percent. This decline was due to several factors, including over-hunting, loss of habitat, and an extended drought in many parts of the country. 
In 1986, the U.S. and Canada worked cooperatively to develop the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. Mexico joined the Plan in 1994, so that the entire continent now participates in this effort. The Plan established ambitious goals and innovative strategies for conserving waterfowl habitat. Under the leadership of former Senator George Mitchell of Maine, Congress provided a funding mechanism for the Plan when it passed the North American Wetlands Conservation Act in 1989. 
I believe that NAWCA has been successful for three reasons. First, NAWCA focuses on the real key to wildlife conservation: the habitat itself. Populations of birds and other wildlife will fluctuate naturally over time, but if the habitat is not there, the species don't have a chance. Under NAWCA, approximately 3.7 million acres of wetlands and associated wetlands have been acquired, enhanced or restored. 
Second, the law sets up voluntary partnerships, without the heavy hand of government regulations. These partnerships involve federal, state and local government agencies, businesses, conservation organizations, and private individuals. Under NAWCA, funding has been provided for about 260 projects, with more than 700 partners--across 45 states--plus Mexico and Canada. 
Third, NAWCA leverages federal dollars with state, local and private dollars. Since its passage, the Act has provided more than $200 million in Federal funds, that have been matched by more than $420 million in state and private funds. 
The benefits of NAWCA and other wetlands protection programs --combined with a few years of heavy rainfall--have been enormous. Populations of ducks and other waterfowl have, in large measure, rebounded to the levels of the 1970s. Every year since 1995 has been billed as a `banner year,' and each year the numbers are even greater than the previous one. This past year's fall migration totaled 92 million ducks, the highest since 1972, and surveys counted 42 million breeding ducks, the highest level since the surveys began in 1955. 
Also, wetlands losses, while still occurring, have declined dramatically: the rate of loss has slowed by 60 percent below that experienced in the 1970s and 1980s. This is a result of regulatory protections under the Clean Water Act and, perhaps even more, voluntary programs like NAWCA and the Wetlands Reserve Program in the Farm Bill. 
But our conservation successes are no reason for complacency. More can and should be done. Each year, good projects must be turned down because there is not enough funding. In addition, abundant rainfall has helped the waterfowl populations rebound, but it is up to us to maintain these population increases when the rainfall abates. Lastly, the pressure to develop wetlands continues to grow each year. By the year 2020, more than half the U.S. population will live in coastal plains. Laws like NAWCA will become ever more important in protecting these areas. 
Support for NAWCA has always crossed party lines. In 1996, 78 Senators signed a letter supporting the North American Wetlands Conservation Act. The need for a healthy environment is a need that transcends politics. With support for laws like NAWCA, we can meet today's challenges and protect the environment for the benefit of our children, and future generations after them. 
The bill we are introducing also reauthorizes the Partnerships for Wildlife Act. This law was first enacted in 1992 to encourage partnerships among the Service, state agencies, and private organizations and individuals to undertake projects to conserve non-game wildlife species. It is modeled after NAWCA, and is the only Federal grants program for the sole purpose of benefiting non-game species--species that are not hunted, fished, or trapped. Projects funded under the Act have covered numerous species across 40 States, and have entailed management programs, research, education and outreach. Since 1994, Federal funding for grants has totaled $4.2 million. States leverage each Federal dollar with one State dollar and one additional private-sector dollar. 
The bill would reauthorize the North American Wetlands Conservation Act through the year 2003, at a level of $30 million per year. It would also reauthorize the Partnerships for Wildlife Act through the year 2003, at a level of $6.25 million per year. These amounts are the same in the current laws, which expire at the end of 1998. 
I urge my colleagues to fully support this bill. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this afternoon I am introducing legislation to suspend the duty on the importation of certain textile printing machines that are used by textile manufacturers in the United States. 
These particular machines are used for the printing of patterns, designs and motifs on fabrics--an important process in the making of textile goods. However, none of these machines are made in the United States. That means domestic manufacturers must import these machines at considerable cost, which does not help their ability to compete in what is an increasingly challenging market. Yet since there is no domestic industry producing these machines, the duties serve little purpose. 
The bill I am introducing would lift the duty imposed on these machines. It is my hope that by doing so, we will be helping the textile industry in this country to improve its competitiveness and maintain its workforce, both in Rhode Island and around the nation. 
By introducing this legislation today, I believe there should be ample time for review and comment on the bill, and that it can be ready for inclusion when Senate begins work on comprehensive duty suspension legislation this year.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask you today to join me in honoring a native hero of Rhode Island, who, by his courage and unselfish interest in the well-being of someone he did not know, saved a man from nearly certain death. 
When Frank `Skip' Pettis III set off to work on January 27, he had no idea that he would return home a hero. Pettis, who owns Pettis Marina near Pawtuxet Cove in Warwick, RI, was working when he overheard radio conversations between the Coast Guard and tugboat operators about a kayaker who was declared missing in Narragansett Bay. 
Pettis jumped into one of the marina's 24-foot salvage boats and raced to the scene. There, he found Steven McGarry of Warwick, without a kayak or lifejacket, floating in the waves and clinging to a pair of empty bleach bottles, being used as traps. Mr. Pettis grabbed the half conscious and hypothermia-sticken McGarry but, unaided, was unable to lift him into the boat. 
Fighting the cold and wet of the waves and the weight of McGarry's body, Pettis waited for what must have seemed an eternity until firefighters arrived to help fish him out of the water. As Pettis put it later, `All I could do was envision him just sliding out of my hands . . . I didn't want that vision stuck in my head for the rest of my life.' McGarry, whose temperature had dropped to 82 degrees, was rushed to Rhode Island Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition. By the next day, thanks to Pettis' heroism, McGarry had sufficiently recovered to give thanks to his rescuer. 
On January 28, just a day after Pettis hoisted McGarry's nearly frozen body from the icy water, Mayor Lincoln Chafee declared `Skip Pettis Day' in Warwick to honor our local hero. 
Mr. President, Skip Pettis is a model for people across America. Hearing of a stranger in need, he joined in a desperate search for a man who, for all purposes, was lost at sea. Finding him, Pettis persevered alone in preventing McGarry's death until help arrived. Mr. Pettis' experience exemplifies a form of altruism that can seem rare today, and, as such, I believe his heroic actions should be honored.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, last week I put into the Record a statement expressing my support for the nomination of Dr. David Satcher for U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. As I indicated then, I believe in his qualifications and achievements, and think he would serve well as the Nation's top physician. Dr. Satcher has excelled in many aspects of the health care system. He has been a provider, a scientist, a teacher, an administrator, in both the private and the public sector. 
I must say I was impressed that the American College of Physicians, which is a very prestigious organization, awarded Dr. Satcher its James D. Bruce Memorial Award for distinguished contributions in preventive medicine. Dr. Satcher has dedicated his career to improving public health. 
The United States has been without a Surgeon General for a little over 3 years. This is unfortunate, I believe. Just last week, Dr. C. Everett Koop, former Surgeon General of the United States, spoke at a press conference which I had the privilege of attending. In that press conference Dr. Koop spoke forcefully about the grave health risks posed by tobacco use, lack of exercise, and poor diet. He did not pull any punches. He gave a stern lecture to all those who were present and hopefully beyond that, about the dangers in America to American young people and to all our citizens from the so-called couch potato lifestyle. 
I have reviewed the statements that Dr. Satcher has made before the Senate Labor Committee and he is clearly anxious to follow in the footsteps of Dr. Koop and his successor, Antonia Novello. At his confirmation hearing Dr. Satcher stressed the importance of disease prevention and health promotion. This is what he said: `Whether we are talking about smoking or poor diets, I want to send the message of good health to the American people.' So I was delighted to learn that one of his top priorities would be to put the health of our children and our grandchildren in the national spotlight. All of these matters fall directly within the job description of a U.S. Surgeon General. 
I might say, it seems to me what we are concerned with, Madam President, is not just extending the life expectancy of Americans. It is beyond that. We want to have Americans in good health as they proceed in their elder years, and throughout all their lives. In other words, it's what they call the quality of their lives that we are concerned with. It is not just living longer, it's that they be healthy and be able to construct a healthy life and a happy one, where they feel good about themselves. 
In the period we have gone without a Surgeon General, we have been confronted with a host of tough public health issues. I believe the need for a Surgeon General has never been greater. We have these problems in my home State of a very substantial percentage, something like 27 percent, of our seniors in high school smoke. This is on the increase, not just in my State but throughout the Nation. We have seen widespread substance abuse, and continued struggle with AIDS, and a startling rate of obesity amongst our youngsters. They just don't get out there and exercise. 
As we consider the potential consequences of human cloning research, I for one would benefit from the perspective that a Surgeon General would bring to this issue 
Several of my colleagues have expressed misgivings about this nomination. Some have raised concerns about Dr. Satcher's views on late-term abortions. Others have questioned his role in a series of AZT trials that have been conducted in Africa. 
I just heard the distinguished Senator from Missouri talk about concerns about the free needle exchange, or needle exchange program. As Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the Labor Committee, and Senator Frist, the chairman of the Public Health and Safety Subcommittee, stated during the debate on the nomination last week, these are not new charges. I am not familiar with the needle 
exchange that was just being discussed here before, but apparently the AZT trials and the late-term abortion matters were thoroughly discussed in the committee and subcommittee. Each of these issues was raised by the committee during Dr. Satcher's confirmation and it is my understanding he responded satisfactorily--satisfactorily to the committee. They reported out the nomination. Indeed, his answers on those and other matters have been available for all Senators and the American people to view. 
So I want to say I am pleased that we have the nomination for a new Surgeon General before us. I applaud the majority leader for recognizing the importance of this post and moving the Senate forward on this matter. 
So I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for cloture and in favor of Dr. Satcher's nomination. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of Dr. David Satcher for U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. I have examined his qualifications and achievements, and I believe he has the capacity to serve this country well in the important role of the nation's top physician. 
On Tuesday of this week, I, along with Senators Graham and Jeffords and Representatives Moran and Leach, announced the formation of the Congressional Prevention Coalition. Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was kind enough to join us at the press conference. 
During the course of his remarks, it struck me how greatly we have missed having a national spokesperson on health issues the past three years. Dr. Koop spoke forcefully about the grave health risks posed by tobacco use, lack of exercise, and poor diet. He didn't pull any punches--he gave a stern lecture to all of those present on the dangers inherent in the so-called couch potato lifestyle. 
I have reviewed Dr. Satcher's statements before the Senate Labor Committee, and he clearly is anxious to start in along the same lines. At his confirmation hearing, Dr. Satcher stressed the importance of disease prevention and health promotion. As he put it, `Whether we are talking about smoking or poor diets, I want to send the message of good health to the American people.' And I was delighted to learn that one of his top priorities in this role would be to put the health of our children and grandchildren in the national spotlight. To my view, all of these matters fall directly within the job description of a U.S. Surgeon General. 
As I said, we have been without a Surgeon General for three years now--a period of time when we have been confronted with a staggering array of public health issues. The need for a Surgeon General has never been greater, as we are seeing an increase in smoking among high school seniors, widespread substance abuse, continuing struggles with AIDS, and a startling rate of obesity among youngsters. And as we consider the potential consequences of human cloning research, I know that I, for one, would benefit from the perspective that a Surgeon General could bring to this issue. 
Several of my colleagues have expressed their misgivings about this nomination. Some have raised concerns about Dr. Satcher's views on late term abortions. Others have questioned his role in a series of AZT trials that were conducted in Africa. As Senator Jeffords, the Chairman of Labor Committee, and Senator Frist, the Chairman of the Public Health and Safety Subcommittee, stated during the debate on the nomination yesterday, however, these are not new charges. Indeed, each of these issues was raised by the Committee during Dr. Satcher's confirmation hearing, and it's my understanding that he responded satisfactorily. Indeed, his answers on these and other matters have been available to all Senators and the American people for some months now via the internet. 
Dr. Satcher's participation in many aspects of the health care system--provider, scientist, public and private administrator--give him the extensive knowledge and experience necessary to fulfill his role as the U.S. Surgeon General. He has dedicated his career to improving public health. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of Dr. Satcher's nomination.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, last Monday several Senators came to the floor to express their concern because the Senate has failed to pass a reauthorization of the Nation's surface transportation programs. Senator Byrd was on the floor again Tuesday and indeed has been on the floor today, Thursday, on this same subject. As Senators and the American people listen to these expressions of concern, I hope they will keep the bigger picture in mind. 
First, why hasn't the Senate passed an ISTEA II bill that would reauthorize our highway and transit programs? Well, it isn't for lack of trying, Mr. President. That bill was before the Senate for a period of more than 2 weeks at the close of the session last year. But Senate consideration of the bill was blocked by a filibuster, a filibuster that was supported by some of the very Senators who now complain about lack of action. 
The majority leader filed four--not one, not two, not three, but four--cloture petitions to force action on the bill. I voted for cloture each and every time. Almost all the Members on this side of the aisle voted for cloture each and every time. But on the other side of the aisle we did not get much support for acting on ISTEA; in fact, we did not get any support. Considering that, Senators who now come to the floor demanding action on this bill used the procedural rules of the Senate to block action just a few short weeks ago. They voted to block ISTEA four times, as I say. Not once, not twice, not three, but four times they blocked action on proceeding to ISTEA. 
On four separate occasions, when these Senators could have used their power as voting Members of this body to help the majority leader move this vital legislation forward, they voted no. They would not help. If they believe ISTEA is a vital bill, why didn't they help? With their help we could have completed Senate action last year. 
Last Monday, one Senator even said that Congress is `derelict in its duty' because it has not acted on the ISTEA reauthorization. Now, `derelict in its duty' is a pretty strong statement. Well, who is it that has been derelict? It has not been the majority leader. He forced four cloture votes on this bill. I did everything I could to move the bill forward. I was ready then. I am ready now. 
If dereliction of duty is a fair charge, I suppose it is a charge most appropriately aimed at those Senators who voted against cloture on this bill four separate times. There is a 
record. Anyone can look up and see who those Senators were. 
Now, my second point goes to the schedule for completing action on ISTEA. The Senators who spoke Monday and Tuesday were talking as if Senate action is all that is needed to wrap this matter up now. They went on at great length about how the States need early Senate action so the States can plan for the coming construction season. These Senators expressed great frustration on behalf of the States because any further delay will greatly complicate the work of the States. 
Well, I am sympathetic to the plight of our State transportation departments because this bill has been delayed. I wish we were at the end of the day and the States had the bottom-line allotments they need for their planning, but as everybody knows, Senate action on this bill is only a very small step in a long traveling process. 
The House has to do a bill. That bill is likely to be very different from the Senate bill so, therefore, we have to resolve the differences in conference and then bring the bill back for passage in the respective bodies. Any State that did any planning based solely on a Senate-passed bill would be making a great mistake. Frankly, they cannot make any plans until the entire process is completed. 
Now, everyone knows that the House has made a very firm decision to postpone action on this transportation legislation, so-called ISTEA reauthorization, until the budget resolution for fiscal year 1999 is completed. That is a fact. The House has said that. Even if we passed ISTEA II in the Senate this afternoon, we would not speed up the process one iota. Even if we passed it last year when some of us were here on the floor ready to take action we would still be forced to wait for the House to complete its work. 
As I look at the calendar, the House is making the task facing the States more difficult. But we cannot change the calendar by voting on this bill today on the floor of the Senate. 
So what is really going on here, Mr. President? Why would Senators who voted to block action on this bill just a few weeks ago now come to the floor demanding action today? Why would Senators who know that we have to wait for the budget resolution to be completed before the House will act speak as if the Senate is `dithering and dallying and delaying' on this bill? 
The real issue, Mr. President, is how much money are we going to spend on the highway program. That is the real question. The Senators who are clamoring for action now are the sponsors of a big amendment to dramatically increase Federal highway spending. They want the bill to come up now because they want their amendment for highway spending to be considered now in a budgetary vacuum with no other priorities competing for the dollars they would like to spend on highways. 
A week ago, the President of the United States delivered his State of the Union Address. Perhaps the most memorable line in that speech was his call to use any future budget surpluses for `Social Security First.' 
If there is a surplus--and at this point everybody should keep in mind it is a projected surplus; the dollars have not actually come in yet--the President said Congress should not spend the money and Congress should not cut taxes; rather, we should use the surplus to shore up the Social Security system so that it can go on meeting the retirement needs of all Americans well into the next century. 
Those Senators who are calling for action on the highway bill now are not exactly in the President's camp when it comes to Social Security first. They might be called the `Highway First" crowd. They want the Senate to take up the highway bill so that they can put a big proportion of the potential surplus into more highway spending before anybody else, including Social Security, can lay claim to that projected budget surplus. 
`Highways First,' that is their motto. I must say, I find their arguments astonishing, especially when they are expressed by the Senator from Texas. It comes down to this. `The Government has a surplus. We must spend the surplus. To do otherwise would break a solemn oath we made to the American people.' 
Now, the surplus that the Senator from Texas most frequently mentions in the context of the highway bill is one that will result because of action taken last year to put the revenue from the 4.3-cent gasoline tax imposed in 1993, that was passed to reduce the deficit--and the vote, as has been pointed out today, was to transfer that--into the highway trust fund. 
In 1993, when the Democratic Party still controlled the Congress, gasoline taxes were increased by 4.3 cents per gallon with the revenue going to the general fund to reduce the deficit. The Senate Republicans all voted against that tax increase in 1993. But last year, with the Republicans in charge, the revenue from that tax increase was transferred into the highway trust fund from the deficit reduction area where it was before. And now we are asked to spend it. 
Now, the notion--this is something I really want to stress --the notion that anybody promised the American people 
to spend that 4.3 cents on highway construction is preposterous. It is just the opposite. The American people were promised that that 4.3-cent increase would be used to bring down the deficit, not to increase spending programs. 
Now that the deficit is under control, the Senator from Texas has led the charge to transfer the revenue from that tax to the highway trust fund. As a result, the highway trust fund is projected to run a big surplus in the future. And without even a blush, the Senator from Texas says we are bound by a solemn commitment to prevent that surplus. Pour it into highway spending whether it is needed or not--tax and spend. Never was there a more open and shut case of the `tax and spend' fever. 
The clamor we have heard over the past few days to do ISTEA now is all about spending the surplus. And who is going to be first at the trough? It is not about dereliction of duty. Senators who voted four times to block the bill just a few weeks ago are in no position now to suggest that the Senate is shirking its duty. 
And it is not about when this bill will ultimately be concluded. I wish it were done already. It is a burden, as anybody knows. No one knows better than some of the Senators on the floor today what it is like to manage a complicated, contentious piece of legislation such as the surface transportation legislation. 
I wish that we could have accelerated the schedule by acting here in the Senate today. Unfortunately, we are not in control of the calendar. The House has decided, as I said before, to wait until the budget resolution has been completed. 
What these Senators really want for the Senate is to vote on their amendment to spend more on highways before any other priorities can make a claim on this potential surplus. `Highways First,' as I say, is their motto. 
I know there are many Members of this body who believe we should spend more on highways, maybe not `Highways First,' not take it all, but some more. For those Senators, I would make three quick points. 
First, the bill reported by the committee--the committee I am chairman of that brought the bill to the floor--dramatically increases highway spending. It is up over 20 percent over ISTEA I. It is up $25 billion over the 6-year period. In the context of the balanced budget amendment reached last year, that essentially freezes discretionary spending over the next 5 years. And here is a program that gets a 20 percent increase. Thus, no one can argue that we did not do very well in connection with this piece of legislation. 
As a second point, if Senators believe that even more is needed, they will have the opportunity to make that case when the Senate considers the budget resolution in March. The committee-reported bill tracks the spending levels given to us in the budget resolution last year. We have followed our instructions in and abided by the budget that this Senate adopted, and the ink is hardly dry on it. It was only signed by the President I believe in July. If the Senate changes course and wants to increase spending in the budget resolution for next year, then I would assume an amendment to ISTEA II to carry out that instruction would be adopted. 
Third, Senators should be careful about the sequence of these decisions. I believe that many Senators have signed on to the so-called Byrd-Gramm amendment without fully understanding all the subtleties. It does authorize massive amounts of additional spending, but it also restructures who has first claim to the funds that are actually appropriated. 
The Byrd-Gramm amendment increases the share of the pie going to 13 Appalachian Regional Commission States and to a trade corridor program that would benefit a few States, such as Texas. Their portion of the pie gets bigger. But if the pie itself does not grow because there is no room in the budget for larger appropriations, the net effect will be that all the other States will go down. In other words, they are locked in at this increased amount for the Appalachian Regional Commission States and this corridor dealing with the so-called NAFTA demands. That is locked in under the proposal that they have. And if we do not increase the overall spending, then theirs stays up there and it comes out of the portion allocated to all the other States.

I will conclude by stressing once again that we have an increase in this bill this year, ISTEA II, over the past, of 20 percent when the other discretionary accounts are frozen. In other words, the nondefense items and the nonentitlement items are all frozen--whether you are talking Head Start, school lunches, the school programs, the health programs; they are frozen--and we get a 20 percent increase, which is pretty good, for this program. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the 1998 United States Olympic Team will soon depart for Nagano, Japan for the 18th Winter Olympic Games. I know I join my colleagues in saluting the American men and women who have worked so hard to compete at this highest level of international competition. 
I rise today to salute a son of Rhode Island, Ron Wilson, who will serve as head coach of the American Men's Hockey team. Hockey is not a sport in Rhode Island, it is a passion. That passion enabled Ron Wilson to achieve All-Star status at East Providence High School, and two-time All-American honors at Providence College, where, as a senior, he led the nation in scoring. His college coach, coincidentally, is also a Rhode Islander. Then-coach Lou Lamoriello is now president of the New Jersey Devils and will also serve as general manager of the U.S. Olympic Men's Hockey team. 
Ron Wilson went on to a successful professional playing career in the National Hockey League and Europe. Today, he is the very successful coach of the local entry in the National Hockey League, the Washington Capitals. He is well equipped to lead our team next month in Japan, having successfully coached the U.S. Team in the 1996 World Cup to a major upset of Canada to win that prestigious competition. The victory was the biggest win for the United States since the 1980 Winter Olympics. 
Hockey is, as I said, a passion in Rhode Island. Indeed, Coach Wilson will look down his bench and see three other Rhode Islanders on his team - Bryan Berard, Keith Carney, and Matthew Schneider. And the U.S. Women's Hockey team will include a majority of players who played their high school or college hockey in Rhode Island. 
The Nagano Games will soon begin, and I extend the heartiest best wishes for success to Coach Wilson, his fellow Rhode Islanders, and all Americans wearing our uniform.

Mr. CHAFEE. 
Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Caring for Children Act, legislation to help all families with their child care needs. 
I want to thank my colleagues who have worked so hard to put this bill together. Senator Hatch, who was a leader in the development of the child care block grant, and is always a stalwart supporter of children. Senator Snowe, who has worked on this issue for many years. Senator Roberts, who has taken an active interest in this issue. Senator Specter, who made an enormous contribution to the development of this bill. And Senator Susan Collins, who we are very fortunate to have on our child care proposal. 
Last night, in his State of the Union Address to the nation, President Clinton issued a challenge to Congress to develop child care legislation in a bipartisan manner with the Administration. Well, that is exactly what we are doing today. 
Our proposal is straightforward and far-reaching. It makes the current child care credit more equitable for lower and middle income families. And, for the first time, makes the credit available to families where one parent stays at home to care for the children. That is a critical step and an important change for families across America. 
Raising children in today's world is a true challenge. In many families, both parents must work in order to support the family. Often, the child care expenses consume all or most of one parent's income. How often do we hear the refrain, particularly from women, that after they pay for day care, there is little or nothing left of their wages. 
Another common complaint is from parents who desperately want to stay home and raise their children themselves--especially in those very critical, early years of childhood--but who simply cannot afford to forego that second income. 
The legislation we are introducing today responds to both of these concerns. We believe that parents should make their own decisions about who is going to care for their children. The government and the tax code should not be promoting one choice over another. 
By making more of the existing child care tax credit available to lower and middle income families, and making it available also to families where one parent stays at home, we are sending the message that the choice is yours, and we support your choice. 
Our bill makes several changes to the existing dependent care tax credit. First, the maximum credit percentage is increased from 30 percent to 50 percent to provide more benefits to those most in need. Second, the income level at which the maximum credit begins to be reduced is moved from $10,000 to $30,000, so that more lower-income families will qualify for the maximum amount of assistance. Third, we propose to completely phase out the credit for wealthier families. Finally, families where one spouse stays at home to care for the children will be eligible for a credit similar to the one they would receive if both parents were working outside the home and the child was in daycare. 
We also acknowledge that we cannot solve the entire child care problem through the tax code alone. Many low-income families do not have taxable income, and therefore cannot benefit from a tax credit. The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) provides critical funding to help these lower-income families--and I have been a strong supporter of the program. Recognizing the critical role CCDBG plays in subsidizing daycare for low-income families in the states, our proposal doubles the block grant over a five-year period. 
Of course, the problem with child care is not limited to just affordability. Many parents cannot find an available child care slot. Our proposal addresses this issue of accessibility by providing a tax credit to businesses to build or renovate on or near-site child care centers for their employees. 
Finally, there is the issue of quality daycare. Parents cannot be productive in the workplace if they are constantly worrying about the health and safety of their children in daycare. We have all read the horrifying stories in the newspapers about daycare facilities that are unsafe or unsanitary, about the poor record of enforcement of standards in many states. 
while we acknowledge that the federal government should not be setting standards for daycare providers, we do believe the states should set at least minimum health and safety standards and enforce them rigorously. Our legislation beefs up this enforcement by rewarding states with a good enforcement record and penalizing those with poor records. 
I am very proud of this legislation, and proud that this group was able to come together and produce this initiative. Child care is a problem that must be solved, and we are committed to doing that. I look forward to working with the President and my colleagues in the Congress to find workable, affordable solutions for all families.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on January 31st, friends and colleagues will gather to honor Michael S. Pinto, who has served Middletown public schools for 36 years, and is retiring as Superintendent. 
Michael Pinto built his career in Rhode Island, just as he received his education in our state. He received degrees from Providence College and Rhode Island College, and pursued additional studies at the University of Rhode Island, Brown University, and Salve Regina University. 
For seven years, Superintendent Pinto worked with students as a classroom teacher, then as Supervising Principal for sixteen years. He served as both Coordinator of Elementary Education and Assistant Superintendent before being appointed as Superintendent of Middletown Schools in 1994. 
Michael has amassed an impressive record of public service. His work in the Middletown public school system is well known. But, he has also been involved with the Easter Seals Society, the YMCA, the Middletown Lions Club, the Rhode Island Senate Drug Advisory Committee, and many other worthy organizations. 
Mr. President, no one has worked harder or has shown more persistence on behalf of the Impact Aid program than Michael Pinto! Barely a month goes by without a letter from Superintendent Pinto reaching my desk, advocating the Impact Aid program and its importance in Middletown schools. 
Recently, a Newport Daily News article described Superintendent Pinto as an easy-going and amiable administrator.' In fact, in the spirit of true compromise for the good of education and the community, Superintendent Pinto has said, `[I'll] tell the School Committee that I'm not interested in a lot of 3-to-2 votes. I'll give up something for a 5-to-0 vote.' It is that quality--doing what it takes to reach a consensus--that has made him a successful leader. 
As Michael prepares for his private life away from the duties of his terribly demanding job, I want to congratulate and thank him for all that he has given to his community.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise to recognize two extraordinary groups of young people in my home state of Rhode Island. These individuals of the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts have distinguished themselves as leaders in their communities. 
Since Baden Powell founded the Boy Scouts in 1910 and Juliette Gordon Low established the Girl Scouts in 1912, many youth have chosen to make new friends, develop leadership skills, assist their communities, and explore new ideas by participating in these two fine organizations. 
In a world where it is sometimes said that role models no longer exist, these young men and women are shining examples to their peers. The skills they have learned while camping, doing service work, and within their individual groups, are the skills they will need to help the world become a better place. 
In order to attain the Eagle Scout award, Boy Scouts must earn 21 merit badges, complete a service project in their community, hold a number of leadership positions in their troop, and finally, pass an oral-administered exam which can last for several hours. The Silver Award is given to Girl Scouts in junior high school after the completion of a service project. The highest honor in Senior Girl Scouting is the Gold Award, which is earned at the culmination of a major service project. 
We also owe thanks to the Scouts' parents and families, their leaders, and the organizations themselves which have guided these young people, and helped them achieve so much. Without this worldwide network of adults teaching children and serving as role models, scouting would not exist. These adults turn the young boy and girls of today into the men and women of tomorrow who will lead us through the 21st Century. 
Mr. President, it is a privilege to submit to you the list of outstanding young men and women who have earned these awards. I ask that this list of future leaders be printed in the Congressional Record. 
The List Follows: 
1997 Girl Scout Silver Award Recipients 
BARRINGTON, RI 
Carly DeWitt; Adina Downing; Lauren Lubrano; Rachel Sockut; Caitlin Wood; Kelly Josephson.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support for legislation that will be considered by the Senate and has been considered by the House this morning. This legislation is the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. This bill, which is a compromise version of legislation that I introduced originally now has as supporters and sponsors: Senator Rockefeller, Senator Craig, Senator Bond, Senator DeWine, Senator Coats, Senator Jeffords, Senator Landrieu, Senator Levin, Senator Kerrey, Senator Dorgan, Senator Moynihan, Senator Moseley-Braun, and Senator Johnson. Mr. President, this legislation will make some critical changes to the child welfare system--changes that will vastly improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of children currently in foster care and waiting for adoptive homes. I am very hopeful that the President, who has indicated his support for this legislation, will sign this measure promptly. 
Mr. President, just yesterday, there was yet another story in the newspapers about a young girl, 9 years old, who was found dead from severe abuse in her sister's Bronx apartment. The tragic story of young Sabrina Green's short life is harrowing, and it is all too reminiscent of the cases we read and hear about, unfortunately, every single day. Each time I read about a case like Sabrina Green's, I feel outrage and frustration with a system that cannot take care of the most vulnerable members of our society. Now, Mr. President, we cannot bring Sabrina Green back to life, nor can we bring back any of the hundreds of children who have died under similar circumstances; but we can take action to prevent such deaths in the future, and that is what we are doing today. 
The bill that will come over to us shortly, Mr. President, will put the safety and health of the child first. That is a significant change in the law. Under this legislation, the safety and health of the child will come first. We will not continue the current system of always putting the needs and rights of the biological parents first. While we still believe that family reunification is a worthy goal, it's time we recognize that some families simply cannot and should not be kept together. Children who have suffered severe abuse or whose parents have committed violent crimes should be moved out of those homes rapidly and into adoptive homes. Our bill does that. Children who are in foster care for over 15 months deserve to have a decision made about their future. Our legislation does both of those things. 
It is also time we put a stop to children lingering in foster care for years. There are currently half a million children in this country--500,000 children in the United States of America--who have been removed from their abusive or neglectful parents and are living in foster care. In my State, there are 1,500 of these children in foster care. Nationally, each of these children in foster care will remain so for an average of 3 years before a decision is made about their future, and many of them will wait much longer. The average is 3 years. Some have stayed for years and years in foster care. Today, we are sending those half a million children a message of hope. Under this legislation, their time in foster care will be shortened. States will be required to make a permanent plan for these children after a year, and if a child has been in foster care for more than 15 months--1 year and 3 months--the State will be required to take the first steps toward terminating parental rights and finding an adoptive home. 
Terminating parental rights is the critical first step in moving children into permanent placements, but it is not enough. We also must promote adoption of these children, and our bill does that. Our bill removes geographic barriers to adoption. There are no limitations under this bill about children in one State having to be adopted in that State. We remove these geographic barriers to adoption and require States to document efforts to move children into safe adoptive homes. We also provide financial bonuses to States that increase their adoption rights. There is money here for States that increase the rate of adoption in their States. 
There are legal and procedural barriers to adoption, and there are also financial barriers. Lack of medical coverage is one such barrier to families who want to adopt special needs children. What is a special needs child? It is a child who has medical problems or physical problems, or a child of such an age, maybe 15 or 16, in a foster home. Adoptive parents are very reluctant to take on a child of that age. Many of these children have significant physical and mental health problems due to years of abuse and neglect and foster care. Many of these children have been shuttled from foster parent to foster parent. So the adoptive parents are taking a huge financial risk in adopting these children if the parents are not guaranteed that there will be health insurance for these special needs children. Our bill ensures that special needs children who are going to be adopted will have medical coverage. We also ensure that children whose adoptive parents die or whose adoptions disrupt or terminate for some reason, they will continue to receive Federal subsidies when they are adopted by new parents. 
Mr. President, I am very proud of this legislation. The Senate and House sponsors have worked tirelessly for many months to come to an agreement. Our shared commitment to improving the lives of these children brought us together. In closing, I want to especially thank my good friend, Senator Jay Rockefeller, who has spent years devoting his time and attention to these children. I also thank Senator Craig, who brought his own personal experiences and dedication to this effort, and Senator DeWine, who brought so much expertise and professional experience to this initiative. I also want to thank the other members of the coalition, those Senators that I mentioned earlier, and I will repeat their names--Senator Bond, Senator Coats, Senator Jeffords, Senator Landrieu, Senator Levin, Senator Kerrey, Senator Dorgan, Senator Moynihan, Senator Moseley-Braun, and Senator Johnson. 
I also want to congratulate the House sponsors who worked so hard on this--Congressman Camp and Congresswoman Kennelly. 
I thank our staffs for the extraordinary efforts they devoted to achieving passage of this legislation. Particularly, I salute Laurie Rubiner, of my staff, and Barbara Pryor, of Senator Rockefeller's staff. All of these individuals that are mentioned, and others, have been so helpful in achieving passage of this legislation, which I think has just now passed the House and will be coming here. We look for rapid action here. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1213, the Oceans Act of 1997 and to thank the bill's principal sponsors for addressing my concerns. This legislation has broad, bipartisan support and as the senior Senator from the Ocean State, I am glad the United States Senate will be on the record on ocean and coastal policy as we enter 1998, which the United Nation has designated as the `Year of the Ocean.' 
The Oceans Act of 1997 is a significant bill. Its 1966 predecessor, the Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act, was one of the seminal developments in environmental law. The act created the Commission on Marine Science, Engineering, and Resources, better known as the Stratton Commission. The Stratton Commission's report, `Our Nation and the Sea' was delivered in 1969 and, among its many important recommendations, led directly to the creation of National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration in 1970. 
I would note that two distinguished Rhode Islanders played leading roles in the Stratton Commission. University of Rhode Island Professor Emeritus John A. Knauss, then the Dean of the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography, was a Commission member and chaired the panel on Environmental Monitoring and on Management and Development of the Coastal Zone. Professor Emeritus Lewis Alexander of the University of Rhode Island, who has had a distinguished career in government and academia, was the Commission's Deputy Director. I expect that the Rhode Islanders will play key roles in the new Stratton Commission. 
The value of our oceans and coastal areas cannot be underestimated. More than half of the United States population lives in or near a coastal area. The commercial fishing industry alone, which depends on these areas, contributes $111 billion dollars per year to the national economy. Moreover, oceans are the lifeblood of the world. The health of our marine resources is intertwined with that of ecosystems throughout the world. 
The purpose of the bill before us is to develop and maintain a comprehensive national policy for our oceans and coastal areas. A national ocean policy includes a broad range of issues from commerce, environmental protection, scientific research, to national security. To that end, the bill establishes a 16-member National Ocean Commission, which will be assisted by an interagency National Ocean Council, in developing and making recommendations to Congress for a national oceans policy. 
As originally reported by the Committee on Commerce, Science and Technology, the creation of the National Ocean Council, raised two concerns. First, how would the National Ocean Council affect the execution of existing environmental laws? Second, is it timely now to create a permanent Council prior to the report of the independent National Ocean Commission created in the bill? 
The manager's amendment that is before us to day answers both of these questions. Any possible ambiguity regarding the National Ocean Council's role is resolved. Existing responsibilities under federal law are unaffected. 
I was concerned creation of a permanent Council now would unduly constrain the Commission's recommendations. The manager's amendment makes it clear, however, that the National Ocean Council's function is to assist the independent National Ocean Commission in the preparation of its report. After the Commission completes its report, the Council will take the Commission report into account in developing an implementation plan for a national ocean and coastal policy. the National Ocean Council will also cease to exist one year after the Commission submits its report. 
Before closing, I want to commend Senators Hollings for his persistence with respect to oceans and coastal policy. I also want to thank him, as well as Senators Snowe and McCain, for addressing my concerns in the manager's amendment.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing 13 bills to suspend the duty on the importation of certain products that are used by manufacturers in my home state of Rhode Island. 
The products in question are organic replacements for colorants that use heavy metals--such as lead, molybdenum, chrome, and cadmium--in the plastics and coatings industries. Heavy metal colorants traditionally have been used in the coloration of plastics and coatings, especially where the applications are subjected to high heat, or where high weatherfastness or lightfastness are required. Until recently, finding substitutes for these heavy metal-based products was difficult. However, thanks to new formulations, a number of organic products have proved themselves to be satisfactory substitutes. 
Reducing our reliance on heavy metal colorants makes sense environmentally. However, none of the organic substitutes in question are produced in the United States. Thus, our producers have no choice but to import the substitutes and pay the requisite import taxes, which range from 6.6 to 14.6 percent. The total price tag associated with these duties, while relatively small in the context of our federal budget, translates into a considerable business cost to the importing manufacturers. The added cost hurts their ability to compete, and thus their ability to maintain their workforce. Yet, given that there is no domestic industry producing these substitutes, the duties serve little purpose. 
The package of bills I am introducing today would remedy this situation by suspending the duty on these thirteen products. As I say, none of these organic substitutes are produced in the United States, and therefore lifting the current duties will not result in harm to any domestic industry. Rather, suspending the duties will allow our domestic manufacturers to reduce costs, thus maintaining U.S. competitiveness and safeguarding Rhode Island jobs. 
This is a critical point. I feel strongly that we in Rhode Island should do all we can to keep the state's economy going by creating jobs, encouraging business activity, and spurring new growth. These bills will help contribute to a productive manufacturing sector in Rhode Island, and aid our employers in keeping their costs down and their sales--and employment--up. 
It is my hope that by introducing this package of legislation now, there will be ample time for review and comment on each bill, and that as a result, should the Senate take up comprehensive duty suspension legislation next year, these provisions will be ready for inclusion.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senate has approved unanimously a bill I introduced with Senator D'Amato which will permit each State to design the back of the circulating quarter dollar. I would like to express my gratitude to Senator D'Amato for his work to ensure passage of this proposal before adjournment and to the long list of colleagues who cosponsored this bill. 
As we all know, the circulating quarters in use today are Washington/Eagle quarters. They have a bust of George Washington on the `head' side and an eagle on the `tail' side. Under this legislation, beginning in 1999, the mint will strike only statehood quarters until all 50 States are represented. Only the design on the back of quarters will change. There will be no changes whatsoever to the size, weight, or other specifications of quarters. This uniformity is necessary to ensure that these new quarters will continue to work in vending machines, telephones, parking meters, and for other similar transactions. 
This program will operate for 10 years, with the mint producing five different statehood coins per year. The order in which States will be represented is based on the order in which States ratified the Constitution and joined the Union. 
Some might ask what the purpose of this proposal is; why not leave well enough alone. It is my hope that this proposal will spark interest in every State across our Nation about its unique history. I hope that school children begin to study the history of their States in search of an appropriate individual or emblem to represent their States on the reverse side of these quarters. I hope that artists, coin collectors, historians, and scholars debate and ultimately join together to suggest an appropriate representation for their State. 
I know that there are a wide range of appealing options for my own State of Rhode Island. Of course, there is the founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams or Anne Hutchinson, who, like Roger Williams, dedicated her life to the principles of religious freedom and tolerance. There is the Anchor of Hope, which is our State motto and is shown on our flag. Rhode Island is the Ocean State, so a seascape would be interesting proposal, as would be a lighthouse or a gull. 
As the coins are minted, I hope that school children as well as adults will collect these coins, and, in doing so, will become curious about the places these coins represent. This modest proposal could lead to a greater interest in geography and history. 
The final design for each State will be selected by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the appropriate Governor, the Commission on Fine Arts, and the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. Each State will nominate a design to the Secretary. 
Last year, legislation was enacted which instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to study the feasibility of a circulating commemorative coin. That study found that there is considerable public interest in the circulating commemorative quarter and that collecting such coins would produce significant earnings. The bill that the Senate approved today will implement this program. Identical legislation has been approved by the House, and I urge the President to sign it into law when it reaches his desk.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that the Senate and House have reached an agreement to continue funding for the Nation's Federal-aid highway, safety and transit programs. The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997 will keep our transportation system up and running. It will give States the flexibility they need to continue transportation planning and construction activities until a permanent reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA] is enacted, hopefully early next year. 
The Senate-House agreement provides $9.7 billion of obligation authority--money States actually can spend. This $9.7 billion in spending authority is distributed according to the structure provided in S. 1454, the Senate-passed extension bill, which we passed this month. Each State is guaranteed at least 50 percent of its previous year's limitation to spend on any transportation project or program. To keep the States on an equal footing, however, no State may spend more than 75 percent of its 1997 spending limitation. 
As you might know, one of the major concerns we had with the 6-month extension bill passed by the House was its formula structure. By adopting the spending structure in the Senate bill, we have avoided the contentious fight over formulas that would have prevented us from going forward had we adopted the House formulas. 
Another important feature of the Senate-passed bill we have agreed to preserve is the flexibility provision. Under current law, the States are restricted in using their unobligated balances across Federal-aid highway, transit and safety categories. The Senate-House agreement allows the States to spend their balances on any Federal-aid highway, transit or safety program category. To prevent important environmental programs such as the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program [CMAQ] from being unfairly disadvantaged, however, the Secretary of Transportation must restore the transferred funds back to these programs when the long-term reauthorization bill is enacted. 
The Senate-House agreement preserves the Federal commitment to safety by funding key ISTEA safety programs. This is a very important part of our legislation. In the United States, there are more than 40,000 fatalities and 3.5 million collisions on our highways every year. The measure before us will help ongoing efforts to reverse this disturbing trend. Funds are provided to enable the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program, the State and Community Safety Grant Program, the National Driver Register, and the Alcohol Impaired Driving Countermeasures Program. 
The federal transit discretionary and formula programs will receive the funds they need. 
The Senate-House agreement will provide funds for the Federal Highway Administration to continue its operations and to assist the States in running their transportation programs. Without the measure before us, the Federal Highway Administration would have shut down in January and 3,600 employees would have been sent home because we lack the ability to pay them. 
The Senate-House agreement extends the transfer of funds from the highway trust fund to the aquatic resources trust Fund to be used for sport fish restoration and boating safety programs. 
The bill also will provide funds necessary for our local transportation planners, the metropolitan planning organizations, to continue their work. 
The agreement also provides $5.5 billion in new contract authority, which will be distributed proportionately according to the structure in the Senate-passed bill. I want to make it clear that this new contract authority will not affect the overall spending limitation of $9.7 billion provided in the agreement. 
Let me add that we will have the opportunity next year to enact a long-term ISTEA reauthorization that will set the comprehensive transportation policy necessary to take us into the next century. 
The majority leader has assured me that the ISTEA II bill--in other words, the one that we will be considering next year, that we have already had on the floor but regrettably we weren't able to get to it for longer--that the bill which was reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee 7 weeks ago will be the first item before the Senate when we reconvene in January. 
That is the statement of the majority leader. 
In the meantime, the Senate-House agreement will keep the State and Federal transportation programs running. It will ensure that no highway contractors will be put out of work because of lack of Federal dollars. And it will continue funding for vital safety and transit programs. Moreover, it will keep the momentum going to enact the 6-year bill early next year. 
Before closing, Mr. President, I want to give special recognition to Senator Bond, who was instrumental in making sure that we addressed these important issues before going home for the year. Senator Bond did yeoman work on this program, as did Senator Warner and Senator Baucus, both of whom are on the floor. And I personally thank them for their diligent and constructive work on this program. 
I also wish to thank the majority leader for all of his help. He was a steadfast ally in assuring that this work would be completed. 
Further, Mr. President, the staff of all members have been tremendously helpful. Jimmie Powell, Dan Corbett, Tom Sliter, Linda Jordan, Cheryle Tucker, Kathy Ruffalo, Ann Loomis, Ellen Stein, Tracy Henke, and Keith Hennessey of Senator Lott's staff, every single one of them have done yeoman's work in connection with getting this bill in the shape it is now, and all of us join in thanks to each and every one of them. 
I thank the Chair.  
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan mentioned that he was going to be vigilant. I can assure everybody within range he has been vigilant, continuously, on this legislation. As a matter of fact, I have not quite gotten to the situation where, when I see him coming down the hall, I will duck into a nearby doorway, but he has pressed Michigan's case very, very strongly. When he assures us that he is going to continue that vigilance, I am not sure I look forward to that with the greatest of pleasure. 
Nonetheless, he argues his case very, very well in behalf of Michigan, and I am sure he will continue that vigorous presentation in the future. So I thank him because he does present his arguments well, and that is very, very helpful.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator from Montana was so right in recognizing the cooperation of the Members of the House. I worked with them, as did the other Members. Several times we had meetings, telephone calls with Representative Shuster, the chairman of the counterpart committee in the House, Representative Petri, Representative Oberstar, and Representative Rahall. All of them were very helpful. Obviously, you cannot get a compromise unless you get the other side to join in the compromise. Fortunately, they were helpful in achieving that. 
Mr. President, also, when I listed the staff members that we worked so closely with, I omitted Brian Riley from the Budget Committee, who was extremely helpful to us. His knowledge and expertise were very, very useful.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Albert W. Moore for his leadership in a critical American industry. Mr. Moore is retiring after serving 8 years as president of the Association for Manufacturing Technology [AMT], a trade group which represents 374 American builders of machine tools and related equipment. His distinguished career in the industry has spanned 43 years. 
The machine tool industry is vital to our country, making possible the production of almost every product which our society today enjoys. More important, these powerful and precise machines are a vital key to the Nation's defense. 
During his tenure as president, and earlier as the elected chairman of the association. Mr. Moore has worked to ensure that the U.S. industry was technologically equal to any in the world, and that its companies are strong and well run. 
Mr. Moore's efforts have greatly enhanced the position of our machine tool industry, and I congratulate him for a job well done.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support for legislation we considered this evening, the Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support for Abused and Neglected Children, the so-called PASS Act. This bill, which I introduced along with Senators Craig, Rockefeller, DeWine, Coats, Jeffords, and others, will make some critical changes to the child welfare system, changes which will vastly improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of children currently in foster care and waiting for adoptive homes. 
We have been working on this legislation for the past year, and I am very pleased we were able to work out a proposal that everyone could support. The primary goal of this so-called PASS Act is to ensure that abused and neglected children are in safe, permanent settings. About a half a million children who have been abused or neglected currently live outside their homes, either in foster care or with relatives. In Rhode Island, there are nearly 1,500 children who have been removed from their homes and are in foster care. Many of these children will be able to return to their parents, but others will not. 
Under the current system, children remain in foster care an average of 3 years. Mr. President, I call to your attention and that of everyone who may be interested in this subject, a child in foster care on the average remains there 3 years before any decision is made about that child's future. And in some cases the wait is even longer. It is time we put a stop to this, and our bill does that. 
The PASS Act directs States to shorten this time, all the while ensuring that the child's health and safety are guaranteed. Our bill removes unnecessary geographic barriers to adoption, and requires criminal record checks for all prospective foster and adoptive parents, and other adults living in the household. It allows children to be freed for adoption more quickly in extreme cases, such as when the parents have murdered another child, and requires States to document efforts to move children into safe adoptive homes. 
The PASS Act also contains some important provisions that will go a long way toward helping to find homes for so-called special needs children. Lack of medical coverage is a huge barrier to families who want to adopt special needs children. Many of these children have significant physical and mental health problems due to years of abuse, neglect, or foster care. Parents who adopt these children are taking huge financial risks. If these children are not guaranteed health insurance, there will be great reluctance in many cases for the prospective parents to adopt these children. Our bill ensures that special needs children who are going to be adopted will have medical coverage. We also ensure that children whose adopted parents die, or whose adoptions are disrupted in some fashion, will continue to receive Federal subsidies when they are adopted by new parents. 
Finally, our bill reauthorizes and provides a modest increase for the Family Preservation and Support Program, which is a worthwhile program that prevents children from having to be removed from their homes. 
This is a good bill. The sponsors have worked long and hard to come up with this compromise. We have talked with the House about the minor differences between our bills and it appears we will be able to quickly conference and pass this bill, hopefully before the Senate goes out this year. 
In closing, let me thank and congratulate the Members of the PASS coalition who worked so tirelessly on the measure. Senators Craig, Rockefeller, DeWine, Coats, Jeffords, and others have made enormous contributions toward this initiative. This would not have happened without their dedication to the children who we are trying to move from foster care into adoptive homes. 
I also thank Chairman Roth of the Finance Committee for helping us to move quickly. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1658, the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act Amendments of 1997. This legislation will allow the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to continue their important work with the States to ensure the continued recovery of the striped bass fishery. 
The striped bass, commonly called rockfish in this area, is an anadromous fish which lives in marine waters during its adult life and migrates to a freshwater river stream to spawn. On the Atlantic coast, striped bass range from the St. Lawrence River in Canada to the St. Johns River in Florida. They are migratory, moving along the coast primarily within the three-mile zone which is subject to State fishery management. Adult habitats include the coastal rivers and the nearshore ocean and are distributed along the coast from Maine through North Carolina. Because striped bass pass through the jurisdiction of several States, Federal involvement in conservation efforts are necessary. 
A severe population decline, which began in the 1970's, raised serious concerns about the sustainability of the striped bass fishery. In 1979, I offered an amendment to the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act that directed the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to conduct an emergency study of striped bass. The study found that, although habitat degradation played a role, overfishing was the primary cause of the population decline. 
In 1981, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission prepared the first coast-wide management plan for the Atlantic striped bass. In 1984 Congress enacted the Striped Bass Act in 1984 to ensure that the States would comply with the plan. The act, which includes funding authority for a Federal striped bass study, has been amended in 1986, 1988, and 1991. The most recent reauthorization bill expired at the end of fiscal year 1994. 
Under the Striped Bass Act, States are required to implement management measures that are consistent with the Commission's plan for the conservation of striped bass. The 
act authorizes the Secretaries of Commerce and the Interior to impose a moratorium on striped bass fishing in any state that is not in compliance with the Commission's management plan. The act also authorizes funding for the ongoing striped bass study that was approved by Congress in 1979 in response to the decline in the Atlantic striped bass populations. The Federal study, undertaken jointly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, provides information on the threats to and the status of the striped bass population and scientific data necessary for sound management decisions. 
The striped bass study in 1994 showed that most population indices had returned to pre-decline levels, and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission declared the species to be fully restored. It is a great testament to the Striped Bass Act and the cooperative efforts of the States and Federal Government that the fishery is continually improving. 
The striped bass has proven once again that, given a chance, nature will rebound and overcome tremendous setbacks. But it is up to us to help the striped bass receive that chance. Reauthorization of the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act Amendments of 1997 will ensure that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Commission will continue to monitor the populations, and collect data that will provide the necessary information needed to make informed decisions essential to maintaining healthy populations of striped bass. 
Mr. President, I strongly encourage the Senate to pass H.R. 1658 to continue one of the most significant recovery ever experienced for a coastal finfish species.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to say how much I appreciate the wonderful work on this legislation by Senator Bond, Senator Warner, Senator Baucus, and others. I am pleased to joint them in cosponsoring the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997. 
Seven weeks ago, the Committee on Environment and Public Works unanimously reported out S. 1173, better known as ISTEA II. I am proud of the committee's efforts to come to an agreement on a very difficult piece of legislation. We filed the report at the end of September, and we were prepared to complete action on the bill before the end of the calendar year. Regrettably, a number of unrelated events having nothing to do with ISTEA have prevented us from completing work this year on a 6-year reauthorization bill. 
As the prospects have dimmed for the enactment of a 6-year bill this year, it is clear that we cannot go home before taking care of a number of concerns. This past Tuesday, November 4, the Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure held a hearing on which many of these concerns were brought to light. First of all, if Congress does nothing, a number of States will be hard-pressed to survive through the spring on their existing unobligated balances. Second, States are restricted in using their unobligated balances across Federal-aid highway, transit, and safety categories. Third, a number of Federal transportation safety programs, as well as the Federal transit program, have no funds to carry over into this fiscal year. Finally, without any relief, the Federal Highway Administration will be forced to shut down in January, which could result in 3,600 employees being furloughed. 
Despite the gloomy reports of what could happen if Congress fails to act, there is a solution. Senators Bond, Warner, Baucus, and I have a measure that addresses the needs of the States, the safety programs, the Federal-aid highway program, and transit. First of all, the bill before us will keep the nation's transportation system up and running until we enact the long-term reauthorization bill. It gives States the flexibility they need to continue transportation planning and construction activities. Each State is guaranteed at least 50 percent of the previous year's spending limitation to spend on any transportation project or program. To keep the States on equal footing, however, no state may spend more than 75 percent of its 1997 spending limitation. 
Second, the bill provides states with flexibility to spend their unobligated balances on any highway, safety, or transit program category. To prevent important environmental programs such as the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program [CMAQ] from being unfairly disadvantaged, however, the Secretary of Transportation would restore the transferred funds back to these programs when the new reauthorization bill is enacted. 
Third, the bill provides funding for key ISTEA safety and transit programs. The Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program, the State and Community Safety Grant Program, the National Driver Register, Operation Lifesaver, and the Alcohol-impaired Driving Countermeasures Program, will continue to run. Also, the Federal transit discretionary and formula programs will receive the funds they need. Fourth, the bill provides funds for the Federal Highway Administration to continue operating and assisting the States with their transportation programs. 
Before closing, let me comment on what the bill before us does not do. Unlike the 6-month extension bill that was approved by the House earlier this month, this bill does not provide States with contract authority for 1 year's worth of highway construction. Our bill gives the States until May 1 of next year to obligate the funds provided in this bill. The trouble with including funds that will not run out until next November is that there will be no pressure to enact permanent ISTEA legislation until that time, right before the 1998 elections. Pushing the decision off until next fall runs the risk of our being without a bill 1 year from now. Moreover, this measure avoids the contentious fight we would have over apportionment formulas and funding categories if we were to take up the House bill. 
The bill before us is by no means perfect, but it is the optimal approach to the situation. Our hopes for an ideal outcome were dashed when we were unable to complete work on a 6-year reauthorization bill. This measure keeps the State and Federal transportation programs running, it ensures that no highway contractors are put out of work, and it continues funding for vital safety and transit programs. Most important, it will keep the momentum going to enact a 6-year bill early next year. And it does all of this without a battle over the formulas. 
Again, I want to commend Senator Bond for his determination in moving this measure forward. I also want to thank Senators Warner and Baucus for their excellent work. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in supporting this important measure.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is a very, very contentious issue. Fortunately, in our Environment and Public Works Committee we were able to report out this basic legislation 18 to 0. Then we have to do this so-called stopgap legislation, because we weren't able to consider the big bill due to a variety of factors. This bill now is a result of bipartisan cooperation. As we mentioned, Senator Baucus has been deeply involved in this, and of course, Senator Warner, Senator Bond, myself, and others. 
I join in the salute to the staff. They have been really terrific.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to assist in the relocation and expansion of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology at Brown University in Providence, RI. 
In 1955, the family of Rudolf F. Haffenreffer bequeathed to Brown University the museum he had founded in Bristol, RI. The museum includes more than 100,000 objects from native peoples of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. 
This is a teaching museum owned and supported by Brown University. It has a number of world-class holdings that attract scholars from all over the globe, and has been described by the American Association of Museums as a `superb medium- to small-sized facility with outstanding collections, excellent exhibits, and a superb program of public education and outreach.' 
While maintaining objects from around the world, the Haffenreffer Museum exhibits extensive archaeological materials from New England that are used to interpret prehistoric and historical cultural developments in Rhode Island and surrounding States. The legislation I introduce today authorizes $3 million to preserve these culturally important collections and to provide expanded exhibition space that will make them more accessible to schoolchildren, scholars, students, and other visitors. 
In 1995, Brown University acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation [RTC] the historic Old Stone Bank Building, built in 1854, along with the early 19th century Federal-style residence known as the Benoni-Cook House, both located in downtown Providence. The RTC took over both properties when the Old Stone Bank failed in 1993. 
Prior to Brown's purchase of these sites, it was unclear how or whether they would be put to use. The funds authorized by this bill will contribute a modest portion of the estimated $15 million Brown University will spend to relocate the Haffenreffer Museum from Bristol, RI, to the bank building and the Benoni-Cook House, both of which are located on the National Register of Historic Places. 
Mr. President, this in indeed a win-win project being carried out by Brown University. We will renovate, preserve, and make fine use of two historic architectural landmarks--while providing greater access to an extraordinary tool for cultural and historical education. This is a fine example of the type of assistance our Federal Government can provide to local communities to preserve and make available for future generations the significant developments of our past. 
Mr. President, I encourage the support of our Senate colleagues.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I strongly support this legislation, which will preserve vital passenger rail service in the United States. I applaud the hard work of the members of the Commerce Committee who have worked out a reasonable compromise on this much-needed bill. 
In the 25 years since Amtrak was created, we've learned several things about passenger rail operations in the United States: First, in today's increasingly competitive transportation marketplace, Amtrak cannot continue to operate viably under the status quo. Second, we recognize political reality and know that the American people will not continue to support taxpayer subsidies of Amtrak if the railroad continues to operate under the same structure that has brought it close to financial collapse. Third, like its counterparts in the highway and aviation sectors, passenger railroad ought to be afforded a reasonable level of Federal assistance for its increasingly urgent infrastructure needs. 
With regard this third matter--Federal support--I am pleased that Congress included within the tax bill passed earlier this year $2.3 billion for Amtrak's capital improvements. These funds will help Amtrak conduct badly needed modernization of its infrastructure so that it can enhance service to its customers and more effectively perform in a competitive marketplace. However, these funds are on hold until the bill before the Senate today is enacted into law. 
What is also needed is a realistic assessment of the Federal laws currently governing Amtrak's operation. Although attention recently seems to be focused on the protections for Amtrak employees, there are a wide range of laws that hinder Amtrak's stated goal of operating more like a business. 
It has been the provisions affecting Amtrak workers that have been most controversial and have stymied action in Congress for the past 2 years. Some of these laws stem from the Depression era, a time when Congress and the President sought to relieve a national tragedy. Others were enacted when Amtrak was first created in the early 1970's, well before the railroad's financial problems had developed. 
In any event, it is important to note that many of these provisions are mandated by law, rather than agreed to through the traditional collective-bargaining process that businesses and labor unions across America deal with regularly. Other employers in the United States are certainly not required by law to provide worker benefits similar to those required of Amtrak. 
If financial and operational viability is going to be restored at Amtrak, we simply must take a candid and reasonable look at all of the very unique laws--not just the labor protections--that have hindered Amtrak's ability to succeed. We must also ensure that, like its counterparts in the aviation and highway sectors, passenger rail is provided a reasonable level of support for capital improvements. These are the goals this bill seeks to achieve, and I am pleased that Senate is able to take it up today. 
Specifically, when amended by this substitute, S. 738 will: 
Authorize $5.163 billion for Amtrak over the next 5 years; 
Mandate that Amtrak be independent of Federal operating subsidies in 5 years; 
Repeal two statutes that affect work rules at Amtrak, and put them into the collective bargaining process. These outdated statutes prohibit Amtrak from contracting out, and mandate 6 years of severance pay for laid off employees; 
Impose a reasonable cap on punitive damages on rail transportation liability; 
Create an Amtrak reform council [ARC] that will regularly evaluate Amtrak's financial performance to ensure accountability to the taxpayer; 
Clarify that the $2.3 billion included within the tax bill can only be used for Amtrak capital improvements. 
When taken together, the provisions of this legislation will restore financial viability to Amtrak by permitting the company to operate more like a business. The bill also gives the U.S. taxpayer the assurance that Congress will no longer provide open-ended subsidies to passenger rail. 
There are allegations that Amtrak's operational reforms are being sought as a ploy to make it less expensive to eliminate these jobs and shut down the railroad altogether. This contention is ludicrous. The biggest threat to these jobs is maintaining the status quo, which is not financially viable for Amtrak. 
If things continue under the current framework, Amtrak will soon be forced into bankruptcy. Such an outcome would eliminate all of Amtrak's 20,000 jobs, to say nothing of depriving the Nation of a needed service. 
Ultimately, our effort to ensure that passenger rail survives into the 21st century should be focused on the customer: we should help ensure that conditions exist that will allow Amtrak to provide efficient, reliable national transportation service without adversely impacting its workforce or burdening U.S. taxpayers. 
Absent this service, Amtrak's customers would go elsewhere, and our highways and airports would become severely clogged. This legislation ensures the viability of passenger rail service for the traveling public, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank both the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness, Senator Inhofe, and the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Armed Services and manager of the bill, Senator Thurmond, for their cooperation in including provisions to reauthorize the Sikes Act in H.R. 1119. 
The Sikes Act was first enacted by Congress in 1960 to provide enhanced stewardship of fish and wildlife and other natural resources on military installations. The act seeks to capitalize on the enormous potential for natural resource conservation on military lands. The Department of Defense controls nearly 25 million acres of land and water at approximately 900 military installations in the United States, and the National Guard oversees an additional 1 million acres on 80 sites. These lands serve as home to approximately 100 endangered or threatened species and countless other fish and wildlife resources. 
The amendment that I offered to the bill, along with Senators Kempthorne, Warner, and Baucus when it was pending before the Senate, would infuse new vigor into the implementation and effectiveness of the Sikes Act. Specifically, it would require the Secretary of each military department to develop a natural resource management plan for each of its military installations, unless there is an absence of significant natural resources on the base. The plan would be prepared by the Secretary in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service and the appropriate State fish and wildlife agency. The plan must be consistent with the use of military lands to ensure the preparedness of the military, and cannot result in any net loss in the capability of the installation to support its mission. With those caveats, the plan must also provide for the management and conservation of natural resources. This language accommodates the interests of the State and Federal wildlife agencies as well as the needs of the military. 
I would like to thank the conferees for accepting the Senate language extending the deadline for completing natural resource management plans from 2 to 3 years from the date of the initial report to Congress, which is required 1 year after the date of enactment. This change was negotiated between the Committees on Environment and Public Works and Armed Services, and approved by all interested parties, including the Departments of Defense and the Interior, and the International Association of State Fish and Wildlife Agencies. This change should enable the Department of Defense to complete the plans within its own internal timeframes, without unnecessarily missing any statutory deadlines. 
As I mentioned when I offered this amendment back in July, jurisdiction of the Sikes Act, since its passage in 1960, has always rested with the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Bills to amend and reauthorize the act, including one that was introduced in the 103d Congress containing substantive revisions similar to the revisions in this amendment, have all been referred to that committee. The fact that reauthorization of the Sikes Act is being done through the DOD authorization bill represents the fortunate circumstance that after more than 1 year of debate, agreement happened to be reached by all parties at this particular time in this particular context. This circumstance does not alter the jurisdiction over the Sikes Act in the future. Nevertheless, the Committee on Environment and Public Works has always worked cooperatively on that portion of the Sikes Act pertaining to military installations in the past, and will continue to do so in the future. 
In closing, Mr. President, I believe that this provision will significantly improve the Sikes Act, and I thank the conferees for all their hard work.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, thank you. I thank the chairman for yielding me this time. 
Madam President, some have argued that fast-track procedures are either unnecessary or that they are a threat to Congress' constitutional authority, or both. 
The answer to that is fast track is none of the above. It is both necessary and constitutional. First of all, fast track is absolutely critical if the United States is to continue to expand global market opportunities for American manufacturers and service providers and their workers. Without fast track, no President can assure our trading partners that the terms of a hard-won agreement will not be rewritten by Congress. That is the problem. 
Now, sometimes it is worthwhile to look at history. In 1934, Congress approved the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which gave the President authority to lower tariffs with our trading partners. That worked fine for several decades. This was when we still had an emerging global trading system which primarily relied on tariffs. Between 1934 and 1945 the United States concluded 29 bilateral agreements for tariff reductions. When the GATT system came into being in 1948, the system still worked. Tariff reductions were the main focus of five successful negotiating rounds between 1947 and 1962. 
But here comes the modern system. By the 1960's, the world trading system had become much more sophisticated and so had trade barriers. In 1962, the Kennedy round began, and for the first time the negotiations addressed not just tariffs but nontariff problems such as antidumping measures. When the negotiations concluded on the Kennedy round in 1967, the Johnson administration brought the agreement back home, but Congress promptly passed legislation nullifying part of the Kennedy round agreement, effectively amending the deal that had been so carefully worked out with the GATT nations. 
The result. What happened? The Kennedy round went into effect without our participation. The message which that sent to our trading partners was obvious. Hard-fought trade deals with the United States will not stick. And the corollary lesson to the United States was equally clear. Before the United States will be allowed back at the negotiating table, it must restore its credibility by demonstrating its ability to stick to a deal. 
Therefore, when the Tokyo round began, President Ford appealed to a Democratic Congress for a solution. The dilemma was noted that our negotiators cannot expect to accomplish the negotiating goals if there is no reasonable assurances that the negotiated agreements would be voted up or down on their merits. So a set of procedures was developed, the so-called fast track. As has been noted here many times, that fast-track authority has been extended to every President, Democrat or Republican. It has been authorized or reauthorized or extended four times, and it is the means by which every major trade agreement since the 1970's has been implemented. 
In mid-1994, fast-track lapsed, and since then our trading partners, quite rightly, have questioned our ability to stick by a deal, and they have been reluctant to deal with us. Some have cited the fact that the administration has concluded all but a handful of 222 trade agreements without fast track. `You don't need fast track. Why, we had 222 agreements without it.' 
That is misleading. There are 200 plus agreements listed by the administration as accomplishments, but look at the list. Most of the agreements tend to be small, product-specific arrangements like an agreement on ultra-high-temperature milk or the List of Principles for Medical Devices. They are certainly important, but they hardly qualify as major stimuli to our national economy. 
In contrast, the handful of agreements that require fast track are the critical, comprehensive, multisector agreements that address both tariff and nontariff barriers. 
Now, let's get to this constitutional argument that has been tossed around. Fast track represents, it is said, a surrender of Congress' constitutional duty under article I of our Constitution, which says that `The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations. . . .' 
Under fast track, Congress' role in trade negotiations has not been diminished or disregarded. Clearly it would be impossible for 435 Representatives or 100 Senators, all of whom believe they are qualified to be President--indeed, I believe there has been a terrible overlooking that they are not chosen as President--each of these individuals could not carry out at the same time our trade negotiations. Now, what fast track does is it allows the President to carry out the negotiations but imposes strict requirements for ongoing consultations to ensure that Congress' voice is heard. 
Madam President, it has been my privilege to have served on the Finance Committee for 19 years now. When we have a fast-track measure come up, there is constant consultation with that committee and other Senators on the negotiations that are taking place that subsequently fast track will be asked for. So the Israel, Canada, Mexico, and Uruguay Round Agreements were guided by thousands, literally thousands, of briefings and discussions between the negotiators and Members of Congress or their staffs. Congress will continue to be consulted. So, indeed, we do write the legislation to implement these agreements, and Congress' authority is not being constitutionally revoked or the Constitution is not being overridden. 
Madam President, the fast-track partnership has guaranteed Congress' continued fulfillment of its constitutional role in international negotiations. 
Now, is every Member of Congress going to be satisfied? No, apparently not, as we have heard this afternoon and yesterday. But will the partnership produce agreements that have taken into account a broad variety of U.S. interests and views? That is absolutely true. 
I would just briefly like to touch on what happens if we do not approve fast track. That is the argument in the Chamber here. Do not have it. I know that it is always prefaced by the opponents saying, `I'm not against free trade,' and then they proceed to inveigh against fast track. 
The United States is the world's largest trading nation, the largest exporter and the largest importer. We are the giant of the world trade area. We enjoy prosperity today in large part because of our trading activities. 
This is what Dr. Alan Greenspan said a week ago, on October 29:  
The quite marked expansion in trade has really had a pronounced positive impact on rising living standards. Since 1992, exports have been responsible for one-third of our economic growth. Trade now represents a solid 30 percent of our GDP, and our exports continue to rise. This export activity supports some 11.5 million well-paying jobs across the Nation. 
They certainly do in my State where we are very, very grateful for our trade and where we believe the opportunities for trade should increase. Our exports from small Rhode Island hit $1 billion last year, with projections for this year estimated at $1.2 billion. State officials in my State count on exports as a key element in our economic growth and are aiming to reach $2 billion in exports by the year 2000, which is only what, 3 1/2 years from now. 
If we want to continue this prosperity, we must continue to advance trade liberalization worldwide. In order to do this, we must have fast track. 
Now, there is urgency to this. We are seeing the southern nations of this hemisphere--Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay--mount an aggressive effort to develop a free-trade region throughout the Western Hemisphere. 
Chile, which is more than a little tired of waiting for us, has completed separate trade agreements with Canada and Mexico as well as Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and they are reaching out to Central America and Asia likewise. Mexico has concluded agreements with Colombia, Venezuela, and Costa Rica, and are talking to the other nations including the Caribbean nations. 
The European and Asian nations are getting in on this. Both the European Union and the Southeastern Asian nations are courting the South American countries. Chinese and Japanese officials are eyeing the major Latin American nations. 
The United States is in real danger of falling behind all of this. That has ramifications for American workers and their families. 
One example that hits close to home for Rhode Islanders is Quaker Fabric Co., a Fall River, MA, textile firm employing 1,800 workers--many of them Rhode Islanders. Quaker recently lost a $1.8 million annual contract in Chile to a Mexican competitor whose product is exempt from Chile's 11-percent tariff thanks to the Chile-Mexico trade pact. And Quaker was told by an Argentine buyer that he was switching to a Brazilian fabric supplier whose product, while of lesser quality, is not subject to a 25-percent tariff. Quaker's president tells me that if Quaker could just gain equal footing in the region with its Latin competitors, the company could boost export sales and add 200 more jobs. 
It is examples like these that have spurred the National Governors' Association and the U.S. Conference of Mayors--whose members are keenly interested in economic growth--to strongly endorse fast track reauthorization. 
Opponents of fast track would have one believe that there are other options than fast track. That is not true. If we want to play in the trade game, if we want to make agreements with trading partners, if we want to continue to engage in the world of trade, we must have fast track. If not, we cannot enter into significant agreements with our partners, and others will quickly move in to fill the vacuum--and reap the jobs--we have left behind. 
In sum, fast track is in the best interests of the United States. It is a necessary prerequisite for negotiations; it is constitutional; and it is critical for economic and job growth in our nation. I urge my colleagues to support the pending legislation.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering S. 1324, a bill introduced by Senator Lott to deauthorize a portion of the project for navigation at Biloxi Harbor, MS. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works unanimously approved this measure on October 29, 1997. 
This technical legislation is necessary as the Mississippi Department of Transportation intends to replace an existing bascule bridge, which spans a segment of the Bernard Bayou Federal navigation channel in Biloxi Harbor, with a fixed span bridge. Construction of the fixed span bridge would obstruct the navigation channel, which was authorized as part of the 1960 River and Harbor Act. However, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has determined that there is no current or expected commercial navigation along the channel. 
Thus, deauthorization of a portion of the Bernard Bayou Federal channel appropriately addressed an artifact of the 1960 authorization and allows for construction of the fixed span bridge. The Army Corps of Engineers has informed the Congress that it has no objection to deauthorization of the Bernard Bayou Federal navigation channel segment identified in S. 1324. Mr. President, I encourage Senate adoption of this necessary measure.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed Lt. Gen. Kenneth R. Wykle to be the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration. I must say that we have been waiting quite some time for this day, as the position has been vacant since Secretary Slater was confirmed in early February. 
General Wykle appeared before the Committee on Environment and Public Works on Tuesday, October 28, and I am pleased to report that he is an excellent candidate for the position before him. He has a distinguished 32-year record of service with U.S. Army, where he led a number of organizations and commands in the United States, Europe, and Asia. He also has extensive experience in managing the transportation of personnel and cargo by air, highway, rail, and ship. I am confident that he will continue to build on this excellent record as Federal Highway Administrator. 
In his new position, General Wykle will represent the Department of Transportation and advise the Secretary on all matters related to the efficient movement of passengers and freight on the Nation's transportation system. The Federal Highway Administration is responsible for implementing a wide range of programs, including the Federal-aid highway program; highway safety programs; motors carrier programs; the federal lands highway program; research and technology; and international programs. 
An issue that is on everyone's mind is the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA. The Federal Highway Administration's role is a critical one in helping to implement this landmark legislation. I look forward to working with General Wykle and his staff through the reauthorization process and through the implementation process, once the bill is enacted. 
It is incumbent upon the Federal Highway Administrator to protect not only the key Federal role in implementing ISTEA II but also the broad perspective needed to guide the Nation's transportation system into the next century. The enactment of ISTEA in 1991 transformed what was once simply a highway program into a program not only for building roads and bridges but also for enhancing our mobility, our safety, and the environment. In the second ISTEA, we must move forward and strengthen ISTEA's laudable goals of intermodalism, flexibility and efficiency. 
I am confident that General Wykle has the experience and the knowledge to lead the Federal Highway Administration through the challenges ahead.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I point out we have been on this highway bill, the surface transportation legislation, for nearly 3 weeks. This was, I believe, the fourth cloture vote so that we could move on and deal with the bill. 
We could not get cloture. The other side didn't want us to have cloture. So that's why we are in this jam. This legislation before us is a 6-year bill. It came out of the committee unanimously. There may be variations and amendments. That is fine. We ought to have a chance to bring them up and vote on them. 
But we could not do that, Mr. President. I think that is very regrettable. Now people are backing off and saying let's possibly have a 6-month bill. I think that is a disaster; nobody can do any long-range planning with a 6-month piece of legislation. 
So I think it is very unfortunate the way this has worked out. I am not sure what the next order of business is or what the next step in connection with this highway legislation will be, but I feel very badly that we did not get cloture so we could go ahead and deal with a good bill, bring up the amendments and vote on them one way or another. But we were unable to do that, and I regret it. 
Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Ohio very much for the work he has done on this legislation, the support he has given it, the kind things he has had to say about my part in it. 
I think it is very important to stress that the Senator from Ohio has long been active in children's matters, particularly this area that we are involved with, namely, adoption and foster care. He knows the existing problems in this system and has been very, very helpful in the meetings we have had in putting this legislation together. 
So I thank the Senator from Ohio very much for his work. And I share his enthusiasm and his desire to see this legislation come up this year, before we leave hopefully. So certainly both of us will do everything we can. We have had some fine meetings with the majority leader on it. Next week, we will be meeting with the chairman of the Finance Committee. Hopefully this legislation can come before us before we leave. 
If there is nobody else desiring to speak, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the remarks by the Senator from New York. I am on the other side on this issue. But nonetheless, it was very edifying to hear the comments that the Senator from New York had to make. 
Several times the Senator from New York said, if I understood correctly, that this measure, this line-item veto, is unconstitutional. My question is, has it been so tested? Or is there anything underway to so test it? In other words, is there a case working its way up through the system to challenge the constitutionality of the line-item veto--which I guess we passed, was it last year? Was it in 1996?

Mr. CHAFEE. I remember when we had the debate on this. I wasn't deeply involved but I supported it. I always have. But I can only believe that there must be a stack of constitutional opinions by learned lawyers, and maybe judges for all I know but 
certainly many from the legal profession, saying that this, indeed, is constitutional. In other words, the suggestions of the difficulties and constitutional problems, as outlined by the distinguished Senator from New York and the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, are not new. In other words, they foresaw what was going to happen and raised those points on the floor. So I can only assume that there was all kinds rebuttal information prepared. I will confess I can't remember the debate with that clarity. I certainly remember the Senator from West Virginia was against it right from the word go, that was clear, and spoke eloquently, as did the Senator from New York. 
But my question is, there must be a quantity of information or opinion on the other side? I can only assume.

To the Senator from West Virginia, I just want to say thank you very much for those very, very kind remarks. As he knows, one of the great pleasures I have had in this Chamber in serving in the U.S. Senate is the relationship I have had with Robert Byrd. I count myself very, very lucky. So I will treasure the kind comments he made. 
I further will say I think I'll believe them all, and if my children have any doubts about their father, I will tell them, `Here is what Robert Byrd said about him.' I will make sure they all get copies of it.

I say this to the Senator. I ask the Senator, I listened to the statements on the floor here from the Senator from Texas and others, and there has been a lot of talk about truth in taxes and how wicked it was that this 4.3 cents has not gone for highways, and that it was deceptive to the American motoring public that when this tax was levied, it was levied on the basis that it would be used for bridges, highways, and so forth. Yet, I ask the Senator, was it not true when that tax was enacted, the 4.3-cent additional gasoline tax, in 1993, it was crystal clear to everybody that that was a deficit reduction; am I correct in that?

<DOCNO>105-chafee-ri-4-19971022</DOCNO>

Mr. CHAFEE. Well, Madam President, the point I am making here is that, in 1993--and we were all here at the time--the President of the United States came forward with a deficit reduction program. In that deficit reduction program--this was in 1993--there was a 4.3-cent added gasoline tax imposed. It was crystal clear to everybody who paid any bit of attention to it that that was for deficit reduction. That went into the general fund. It wasn't for gas, it wasn't for highways or bridges, it was for deficit reduction. I voted against it. Every single Republican voted against it, but that is neither here nor there. The fact is that it passed. In those days, there were a majority of Democratic Senators in this body, and those 1993 moneys were clearly for deficit reduction. So the reason I am stressing this is because we have heard some powerful discussion here on the floor about truth in taxes and how unfair it is to the American public that when our wives go and pump the gas into the car, they believe that every tax they pay on that is going into roads and bridges. That may be what they think, but that isn't what the facts are. In 1993, it was crystal clear. There was all kinds of debate here. I am not saying that was wrong. I voted against the entire package but, as I said, that is neither here nor there. It is clear that the money for gasoline taxes was to go for deficit reduction.

Mr. CHAFEE. I am not going to argue against the action that was taken at that time. I think the Senator may well be right, that those actions started a glidepath toward significantly reducing the deficit. All I am saying here is that nobody was under any illusions at the time. I am just trying to rebut the statements being made here that what we need is truth in taxation, truth in gasoline taxation, and that this is a great deception to the American people. There was no deception. It was absolutely clear in 1993 when those votes were taken--I am not arguing with people who voted for or against it, but nobody in this Chamber was under any illusion that that money was going to build roads or bridges. It was going to go to deficit reduction.

<TEXT>
Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I want to call to the attention of my colleagues, both here on the floor and elsewhere, that there will be a Domenici-Chafee amendment which will provide a simple, fast-track method to increase highway spending without requiring an entire new ISTEA bill. So let's put to rest the suggestion that all kinds of complications are going to have to be gone through in order to increase highway spending under the bill that is before us, plus the amendment that Senator Domenici and I will submit. 
So, therefore, you say, what's the difference? What's the difference between the two bills? Domenici-Chafee provides a fast-track method to provide additional funding and the so-called Byrd bill, Byrd-Baucus-Warner-Gramm bill says there will be increased funding for highway spending. But, let me just tell you the difference, Madam President. What the Byrd bill says, it says, now, what the contract authority will be, and since that is to be apportioned in just the present proportions that exist amongst the States, that applies a chart immediately that will go out, telling each State what it will get for each successive year. 
There is a hitch there, though. That's a promise, it appears. But the sponsors are stressing that it is not a promise, that the appropriators do not have to provide that amount of money. Here is the problem under that approach. I just look here on page 2, `Authorization Of Contract Authority: There shall be available from the Highway Trust Fund . . . to carry out this subsection [$5.x billion] for fiscal year 1999,' $5.471 billion the next year, on and on it goes until it gets up to $5.781 billion. 
That is contract authority. And, absent something occurring, that is what the States will get. But the question is, is that what the appropriations are going to be? Here is the hitch. Every State department of transportation will look, as I say, at these amounts, everybody can figure out what their percentage is now and, since the promise is they are going to get the same percentage, we will figure let's see, what does Rhode Island get out of this? Let's see, in fiscal year 2001 things look pretty good. You just take $5.573 billion, which is on top of the amounts we have already, the $21 billion, you just add that in and figure this is what we are going to get in Rhode Island. But Rhode Island is not--or Maine, or Montana or West Virginia--is not necessarily going to get these amounts which appear to be promises because they are not promises because the appropriators have to act. 
So, it seems to me the proponents of the bill are riding two horses here. One, they are saying to every State, you are going to get 25 percent more, isn't that wonderful? At the same time they are saying, oh, there are no commitments. Nothing is done. We are not breaking the budget. We are just going to leave it to the appropriators. Other programs can get what they want. 
The problem, it seems to me, is once you get these sums out there in contract authority, as is in the Byrd bill, that every department of transportation, every Governor will figure that is what is coming and there will be tremendous pressure on this body to come through on the promise, seeming promise. They will stress, rightfully, it is not a promise. But who knows what the requirements are going to be for the budget, on the budget in the year 2001? Or 2002? Or 2003? It may well be we want to spend more on education. We may want to spend more on health care. It may be we want to cut taxes. But here this is locking us in. 
I know they will deny it is locking us in. Why, contract authority, that is just there, you can change it. But I will guarantee by this time tomorrow every State will have a chart showing what they are going to get for 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003. And it will appear to be a promise. That, to me, I believe, is a definite flaw in this measure.

Mr. CHAFEE. What I am saying is these amounts are listed here as contract authority. I mean that is the word. And that means that every single State will anticipate--they can work these percentages out. You don't have to be a Phi Beta Kappa to do that. And they will anticipate what they are getting. 
Indeed, proponents are already saying every State is going to get 25 percent more. They don't know they are going to get 25 percent more. That is what I mean. They are riding one horse saying you are going to get 25 percent more because there it is, `in contract authority.' At the same time they are saying we leave it completely up to the appropriators, it is not necessarily 25 percent. 
Which is it?

Mr. CHAFEE. I might say I think the Senator is on weak ground to suggest I am slow. If I understand, the first discussion of the Byrd amendment was on October 9th. I know there is a gestation period here, but this has been unusually long. Whereas we have not been discussing our amendment publicly and talking about it, it is going to come. I think it was first going to come on the 10th; then it was going to come on Monday the 20th. Then we looked forward with bated breath for it on the 21st. Indeed, it has not even been submitted yet. 
You could perfectly well revise this. I don't know why you haven't filed it.

Mr. President, tomorrow morning following the period of morning business the Senate will conduct two consecutive rollcall votes beginning at 11 a.m. The first vote will be on cloture on the committee amendment to the ISTEA legislation, to be followed by a vote on passage of the continuing resolution. 
If cloture is not invoked at 11 a.m. on Thursday, it is hoped that the second cloture vote will occur Thursday afternoon. Therefore, Members can anticipate rollcall votes throughout Thursday's session of the Senate. 
It is the leader's hope that the Senate can make progress on the highway legislation--it is my hope, too, I might add--during tomorrow's session. In addition, if any appropriations conference reports become available, it would be expected that the Senate consider those reports in short order.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for his thoughtful comments about global warming. It is a subject in which I am deeply interested. 
I was very interested and pleased with his references and comparisons with what took place with the Montreal protocol and our efforts that were successful in controlling chlorofluorocarbons, so-called CFC's. There is an example where the first scientific body of opinion suggested that, indeed, the CFC's were destroying the ozone layer. There was great skepticism, not only in this body, but throughout the Nation. But gradually, through testimony and through powerful speeches and articles by those who were involved, this country came to recognize that, indeed, CFC's were destroying the ozone layer, were causing skin cancer to our population and the population of the world. 
As a result of that, we moved forward and various meetings were held, which many of us remember, and capping it all off was the Montreal protocol, which called for substantial reduction of the production of CFC's in our country and the world. 
At the time, it looked as though it would be very difficult to achieve, but as the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out, the United States' scientific and mechanical ingenuity rose to the surface and, lo and behold, we not only met those reductions but we exceeded them. 
The results are now showing that the amount of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere has been reduced, at least the increases have been reduced, and gradually we will see a reduction in the total body of CFC's, as it were, in the atmosphere, because all of this takes a long time to achieve. 
I also say to the Senator from Massachusetts that I think it is important to stress not only the costs of complying with a global warming treaty--that is always what is portrayed, it is going to cost our farmers, it is going to cost our manufacturers, it is going to cost our automobile industry, the coal miners, and on and on it goes. The costs of complying. But rarely does anybody ask, what are the costs if we don't have the treaty? 
The scientific evidence, as the Senator from Massachusetts was pointing out, is increasingly coming to be recognized that, indeed, the world is becoming warmer, just as the Senator pointed out what is happening to the ice accumulations, the glaciers. In every single place in the world, the glaciers are retreating. Why is that coming about? It is coming about because of the increased temperature, infinitesimal though it might seem, that is occurring throughout the world. 
So more and more I believe we have to say to ourselves, what does it cost if we don't do anything? Just take Florida. I don't know what the height of Florida is above sea level, but it must be tiny. If they get an increase in the level of the oceans of the world, and particularly those in the Caribbean, for example, the effects to Florida can't help but be devastating. Indeed, in my State, likewise; Massachusetts, likewise. In all our States, we are doing what we can to increase seawalls. What is happening? We are not sure. All we know is, once upon a time, our beaches were steeper and now they have been cut away. Now we have to have breakwaters and barriers and groins, as they call them, and so forth, to try and prevent the erosion of the soil. 
The Senator from Massachusetts pointed out what one of the presidents of one of the oil-producing countries of the world had to say. I would like to also point out a statement by the chairman of the Ford Motor Co. finance committee, none other than William Clay Ford, Jr. This is what he had to say on October 11, just 10 days ago, as quoted in the Washington Post:  
Ford Motor executive William Clay Ford, Jr., called global warming a genuine threat to the environment and said automakers who oppose a proposed treaty to address the problem risk being `marginalized' in the court of public opinion. 
This is what someone, whose family owns 40 percent of the voting stock of Ford Motor Co., had to say. 
The remarks by Ford, a leading contender to become chairman of the No. 2 automaker, distances himself from several Detroit executives who, in recent months, have criticized the proposed global warming treaty saying the phenomenon might not exist or its causes are uncertain. 
So that's what the leader of the second largest automobile manufacturing company in our country had to say. 
All I am saying to my colleagues, and substantiating what the Senator from Massachusetts said, is let's examine this thing carefully. Let's look at what the scientists have to say. We can say we don't agree with them. I don't know how many Nobel laureates there are in that group--are there 10 Nobel laureates in that most recent group? It is something like that--plus a total of 2,500 scientists. 
I believe this thing is serious, and I think we ought to approach it with that attitude and not say, `No, we're not going to have anything to do with it because if we have anything to do with it and try and solve the problem it will be very expensive.' Well, that is no way to approach things. 
I commend the Senator from Massachusetts for the remarks he made, and I hope that all our colleagues were listening. This thing is serious; let's take it seriously. We may not agree. We may have different scientific evidence, but let's not just trash it because it is going to be expensive to comply with.

This letter points to certain technical violations of the Budget Act in S. 1173. We have made adjustments in the committee substitute for S. 1173 which was agreed to on October 8 to correct those deficiencies. 
So that is the first letter, Madam President. 
The second letter, dated October 6, 1997, includes more detailed information on the Minimum Allocation Program, one of the components of the Federal Aid Highway Program that is exempt from the annual obligation limitation. The Committee on Environment and Public Works used the information in the October 6 Congressional Budget Office letter to make the technical budget corrections found in the committee substitute amendment to S. 1173.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished senior Senator from New York for his very fine comments. Coming from him they mean a lot. As we all know, he was the principal author of the bill that emerged from the conference in 1997, the so-called ISTEA legislation. It is due, principally, to Senator Moynihan, that that bill came out as it did. All of us were there. The Senator from Montana and I and others were there during those negotiations. The Senator from New York was not the chairman of that conference, the chairman was the Representative from New Jersey, Mr. Roe. But the chairman of the Senate in the conference was the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee at that time, the Senator from New York. 
Out of that came a bill that I think has been a model. I have always said it and I will say it again that the principal credit for doing that, achieving that, was what the Senator from New York did. 
Regarding the magnetic levitation, I agree with him, the Senator from New York. Based upon his urgings, I went over to Bremen, Germany, to see the magnetic levitation demonstration tracks. It is about a 10-mile track that is in the form of a figure 8. We attained at that time speeds of over 300 miles an hour with a cruising speed of 240 miles an hour. It was so calm you could rest a glass of water on the table or you could write a letter with ease. 
As the Senator from New York mentioned, there were considerable sums in the ISTEA legislation, but those sums, as I recall, were not spent but were taken back by the appropriators over the years. So we have $30 million more from that in here. From that, we believe the Department of Transportation can arrive at the site. We ought to try one of these. Where it will be, I don't know. It could well be in Texas or Florida, moving vast amounts of people back and forth in some fashion wherever it might be. I am sure it will not be in the State of Rhode Island, but I am for it. And I am not necessarily saying we have to develop new technology. I think the Germans have developed some outstanding technology. I have not seen the one in Japan. 
I think we ought to get on with it and see how it works in this country and see not only if the construction costs can be amortized but the operating costs, likewise. 
Again, I thank the splendid Senator from New York for his comments and appreciate the support he has given this legislation from the word go.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is curious that both the Senator from Montana and I serve on the Finance Committee, likewise on the Environment Committee with the Senator from New York. So I have served with the Senator from New York for some 21 years on this committee and 18 years or so on the Finance Committee. And then we both were on the Intelligence Committee back and forth at different times. The Senator from Montana has been on the Finance Committee, likewise, 15, 16 years or so. So I have always felt, Mr. President, because of serving on those committees with the Senator from New York that I received a Harvard education without having to pay for it, and it has been worth it. 
I know the story the Senator has told about then, I believe, Second Lieutenant Eisenhower leading a convoy across the country. I think it took about 40 days. And from that, as the Senator from New York pointed out, came this inspiration for the then Lieutenant Eisenhower, later General Eisenhower, and then President Eisenhower, that we ought to build superhighways to get across this Nation. 
So I echo what the Senator from Montana says. It has really been a pleasure to work with the Senator from New York.

I say to my colleagues that might be listening, we have not seen that yet. That has not emerged. I hope people would go slow on cosponsorship of measures such as that because Senator Domenici and I have an approach that we think is a very good one and we want to make sure that people just don't get committed in advance, particularly on a measure they have not even seen yet. 
I believe I am correct in saying that the Senator from Montana, that measure which was discussed on Thursday a week ago, in other words, something like the 9th of October and was imminent, has not yet appeared, am I correct?

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the point I was making is on October 9, Thursday, before we left here, we were promised that this amendment was imminent. As a matter of fact, I thought I would be handed a copy then. But now, 11 days have gone by and we still have not seen the amendment. 
All I am saying to my colleagues is, just be cautious before leaping on as cosponsors of something that no one has seen yet. I don't know what the problem is, the hold up in this piece of legislation is, but all I know, it is not here yet, and while the prediction is it will be soon, all I can say is that is exactly what was said 11 days ago, and despite the time off that staffs and others had during the recess, nothing has emerged. 
I ask my colleagues to just hold their fire and keep their ammunition dry and let's see what the different proposals are that are inside here, including the one which I wouldn't characterize in the same fashion as the Senator from Montana did, namely, the Domenici amendment, which I will be part of. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate began consideration of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997, or sometimes referred to as ISTEA II. 
This legislation is the product of well over a year of hard work and careful negotiation. 
We had three different proposals, Mr. President, all commendable, and the requirement before us was to integrate these different proposals into one unified plan that all of us could rally around. When I say us, I was, of course, talking about the committee at the time, the 18 members of the Environment and Public Works Committee, but hopefully the entire Senate. When I am taking about 18 members, I, of course, am referring to Democrats and Republicans. 
I am pleased that the bill before the Senate truly represents a consensus effort with cosponsors from all regions of the country and from both sides of the aisle. The results of these efforts, so-called ISTEA II--ISTEA, again, referring to Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997--provides $145 billion over the next 6 years for our Federal highway, highway safety, and other surface transportation systems. 
Mr. President, this is a 20-percent increase for the Federal aid highway program over the level provided in the original ISTEA, which stretched from 1991 to 1997 a, 6-year bill. This bill preserves and builds upon the laudable goals of intermodalism, flexibility, and efficiency, all of which goals were found in the original ISTEA legislation. 
It does so within the parameters of the balanced budget agreement that Congress passed just 2 months ago, Mr. President. In my view, the most important aspect of this bill is that it works within the context of a balanced budget. We were given x amount of dollars, we stayed within that x amount of dollars. I feel very strongly about that, Mr. President. 
On the Nation's highways you get to where you are going by staying within the lines and playing by the rules. The budget is no different. I am very proud that the program that we brought out of the Environment and Public Works Committee, so-called ISTEA II, stays within the parameters of the balanced budget, a budget, as I say, we only adopted 2 months ago.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I know the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee has some comments. But let me just say briefly, I want to put one thing to bed around here, to rest, and that is that this gas tax has been collected with the people who are paying it believing it is all going into a highway trust fund. 
Let me just review the bidding a little bit. Many of us--I certainly was here, the Senator from Montana was on the Finance Committee at the time, I don't know whether the Senator from Texas was. But in 1990, there was a 5-cent-per-gallon tax started; 5-cent-per-gallon tax; 2.5 cents of that was to go to the general fund, 2.5 cents to the highway trust fund. This was no secret. It wasn't something that was slipped over anybody. We all voted for it up or down, knowing 2.5 cents of that 5 cents was going into the general fund of the United States. There is none of this business of coming to the pump, looking at it and thinking that tax you are paying all goes into building highways. 
Then in 1993, we added a 4.3-cent tax, all to go to the general fund, and that was no secret either. 
So, Mr. President, I just want to say that this idea that we are somehow deceiving the public by piling up money in the general fund from the gasoline tax is just not accurate, and everybody who was in the Senate at the time--that is everybody here--certainly those on the Finance Committee clearly knew where the money was going to go. 
Let me just say something else. I know the Senator from New Mexico is going to deal with this further, but I must say, this is a world record around here. We passed a budget in August. That is when it was signed, August. September, October we are going to deviate from it. 
The proponents are riding two horses here. One they are saying, `Oh, it's not going to affect anything,' and that is right, because under this amendment, it goes out to the States but can't be spent until one of two things happen: until the other domestic discretionary accounts are cut or the cap is, or the overall discretionary cap is raised. That is true. 
So on one hand you can say what marvelous things are going to be done for the highways, every State is going to get more, how wonderful it is, and then you say, `Oh, no, none of it is going to be spent; therefore, it is not going to affect the budget at all.' 
When the time comes and the decision is made, you radically alter the budget that was just signed by the President a month and a half ago, probably it is 2 months ago now. That is a world record for this Chamber. Usually we don't deviate from a budget until we have gotten into it a little bit, but here we change it after a little less than 2 months. I don't think that is a very good record we should be proud of in this Chamber. I know the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee will be speaking, and I look forward to hearing his remarks.

Mr. CHAFEE. Maybe you did, but the idea that this was adopted by some masquerade, somehow the impression `when my wife goes to the gasoline station she is thinking that all that tax money is going into the highway trust fund and that if we send it anywhere else we are deceiving her,' that is nonsense. It was nonsense right from the beginning, as I said, in delineating the history of what took place in 1990 and then in 1993.

Mr. CHAFEE. Sure. Let me say one thing, if I might, Mr. President. I am now in my, I guess, 20th year here, and I have been on the side of the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. I remember lifting the Turkish arms embargo about the first year I came here. And then I have been on the other side, against him. As a general rule, I would far prefer to be on his side than against him. I find it is a much more comfortable position, perhaps a safer position in many ways. So I am very, very conscious that when I duel with the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, I have to be on the alert. 
I will buckle on my breastplate of righteousness, I shall seize my cap of salvation, I shall grab my sword of the spirit and prepare for combat.

Mr. CHAFEE. I explain to the Senate this amendment was made necessary to correct certain provisions that are in technical violation of the Budget Act. The bill reported by the committee stays within the overall spending limitations imposed by the budget resolution, but not every dollar is in the right category. We have made adjustments in this substitute amendment that correct those deficiencies. The adjustments do not affect the allocation of the dollars to any State nor the certainty that those dollars will be delivered by the formula in the bill. 
The amendment does not affect the substantive provisions of the bill in any other respect, but puts some of the spending authorized by the bill under the obligation limitation to ensure that we meet the technical requirements of the Budget Act. 
It is my understanding the committee has a right to modify its amendments in this way. I polled the committee yesterday, and a majority of the members agreed to this modification. The substitute amendment now is the only committee amendment and is open to amendment by any Senator and will be the vehicle for conducting debate on this bill.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senate has the opportunity to improve the system by which we finance our elections. Yesterday, the Senate had before it two proposals: one sponsored by Majority Leader Lott and Senator Nickles; the other sponsored by Senators McCain and Feingold. Much of the discussion of these proposals, both here in the Senate and in the media, characterized them as mutually exclusive. For the most part, Republicans were expected to support the Lott proposal, and all 45 Democrats and a handful of Republicans were committed to voting for McCain-Feingold. 
The paramount goals of any true effort to reform the system of financing elections for Federal office must be to reduce the influence of special interest money on elected officials and to level the playing field between incumbents and challengers. The partisan division that has created the procedural situation in which the Senate found itself yesterday suggests that these goals are not yet at hand. Although the proposals before us are not the final resolution to the problems that afflict the current system of campaign fundraising, they do provide a good starting point. 
I voted for cloture on both the Lott proposal and on the underlying McCain-Feingold bill. Do I think that the majority leader's proposal is flawless? Of course I don't, no more than I think the McCain-Feingold bill provides all of the solutions to the outrages of the 1996 elections. But, I also do not agree with those on the other side who have called the Lott amendment a poison pill. The truth is that together these proposals establish a sound starting point for a reasonable debate on campaign finance reform. It's time to let the process go forward. The Lott amendment should be opened up to improvements, just as the McCain-Feingold bill should be amendable. 
As I see it, the goal of the Lott amendment is meritorious. It is to give union members some say over the political uses of their money. Today, union dues are used to support or oppose particular candidates without any authorization from the dues payers. McCain-Feingold takes a small step to address this problem, which amounts to compulsory contributions to candidates. Under the McCain-Feingold bill, dues paying, non-union members would be eligible for a refund if they disagreed with the political uses of their dues. That takes care of an estimated one million workers, but 16 million union members are left without any control over the political uses of their funds. That seems fundamentally unfair. 
Senator Lott's amendment seeks to address this unfairness. According to the Lott amendment, unions would be prohibited from using dues for political purposes, including lobbying, unless individuals gave prior written consent. As I understand it, the prior consent requirement is viewed by opponents to be onerous, and, I think, the limitation on lobbying simply doesn't apply to the issue at hand--Federal election campaigns. As many know, Senator Snowe and others--who feel as I do, that this debate should move forward in an effort to find common ground--have been working to refine this proposal. A vote for cloture on the Lott amendment is a vote in favor of moving the process forward. It is a vote in favor of opening up the Lott proposal to improvements. 
I also voted for cloture on the McCain-Feingold bill. Senators McCain and Feingold have made considerable improvements to their bill. They have worked to accommodate the concerns of other Senators, particularly Senator Collins who has worked hard to move this process forward. I continue to have concerns about some of the provisions of the bill. The treatment of independent expenditures is not wholly satisfactory to me, although Senator McCain assures me these provisions were suggested by top experts on Federal elections. I filed amendments that I believe could improve the McCain-Feingold bill, but, of course, the Senate cannot get to the point of debating the merits and flaws of the bill unless cloture is invoked. 
As far as I am concerned, the most important problem to be addressed this year is one that barely existed a few years ago, the explosion of soft money in the process. Not too many years ago, many of us were here debating whether PAC's, political action committees, should be able to contribute $5,000 per candidate, per election. We worried that these PAC contributions might appear to give special interests too much influence. But the soft money explosion has made those amounts seem like pocket change. I believe that if all else fails, we must deal with the soft money problem, and we must take steps, at least, to impose disclosure requirements on the money that is spent on so-called `issue ads.' We also should seek common ground on the Lott amendment. The Senate has the opportunity to make these important changes in the current fundraising system by invoking cloture on both the Lott amendment and the underlying McCain-Feingold bill.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Senate will vote on the creation of the first federally funded private school voucher program in the Nation. 
It is no accident that this new voucher program is being debated on the D.C. appropriations bill. None of us has a constituency in the District of Columbia. We can do anything to the District, and we are unaccountable to its voters for our actions. And in recent years, Congress has done quite a bit to the District of Columbia. 
Two years ago, in recognition of poor city management and extreme budgetary problems, Congress created a financial control board to help get the city back on its fiscal feet. Not quite a year ago, the control board announced the formation of an emergency management team for the city's schools. The elected school board was relieved of its authority. The superintendent was urged to resign, and a new team was established, which is headed by retired Gen. Julius Becton. 
General Becton signed on for a 3-year tour of duty in D.C. schools, yet before even a full year has passed, Congress is poised to pull the rug out from under him by creating a private school voucher plan. 
Supporters of private school vouchers prefer to call them school choice. But parents don't choose the schools their children will attend. Private schools select the children they will accept. This is not a luxury our public schools enjoy. Public schools are committed to providing an education to all children: To children who come to school at any time of the year, to children with disabilities, to children whose primary language is not English, to children with disciplinary problems, and to children with low IQ's. 
Private schools have the ability to select the smartest, the least difficult students with the fewest challenges to overcome. Supporters of the voucher plan point out that there are a number of inner-city, parochial schools that take whatever child comes to the door. There is no doubt that parochial schools have an important role to play and are doing a good job, but that does not mean that they should receive Federal funding. It does not mean that they have taken on all of the obligations of our public schools. 
I believe that it is wrong to provide Federal dollars to private or parochial schools to enable them to skim the best students from the public schools. Vouchers also would skim the students whose parents are involved in their child's education, leaving the public schools with the greatest challenges. 
Supporters of the voucher plan say District of Columbia should provide choices to parents. They say District of Columbia should have charter schools. They call for partnerships between city schools and the Smithsonian Institution. The truth is that District of Columbia has all of these things. The District has public school choice. There is a charter school program at a school not six blocks from the Capitol. Down the street there is a middle school which has entered into a partnership with the Smithsonian. D.C. public schools are the only public schools in the area that provide an all day kindergarten program, and every high school in the District is a magnet school. 
A lot of attention has been paid to the fact that the schools didn't open on time this year, and Congress is not without responsibility for the delay. But very little mention has been made of the rigorous standards that have been put into place in every school, here. Starting this school year, teachers, parents, and students have a clear idea of what the children should know at each grade level. Last week, students all across the District were tested in reading, math, and language arts to see what level they are at. At the end of the school year, they will be tested again, to assess their progress. The performance of teachers and principal also will be based on these assessments. The pressure is on not to let a single child slip through the cracks, and I think that is an enormous step in the right direction.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, these are improvements that will help all of the students in the District of Columbia schools, not just 3 percent of the students. Let's support what works for all of the children, not just a handful of them. That's the point of public education. 
I plan to vote against the voucher plan and urge my colleagues to do the same. Let's send a clear message to General Becton and the teachers, parents, and students in D.C. schools: We support your efforts to make your local schools better for everyone.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted to introduce legislation with Senator D'Amato, chairman of the Banking Committee, to create a circulating commemorative quarter representing each of the 50 states. Last year, legislation was enacted which instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to study the feasibility of a circulating commemorative coin. That study found that there is considerable public interest in the circulating commemorative quarter and that collecting such coins would produce significant earnings. The bill that I am introducing today will implement this program. Identical legislation has been introduced in the House. 
As we all know, the circulating quarters in use today are Washington/Eagle quarters, that is they have a bust of George Washington on one side and an eagle on the reverse side. Under this legislation, beginning in 1999, the Mint would strike only statehood quarters until all 50 states were represented. Only the design on the back of quarters would change. There would be no changes whatsoever to the physical size, weight, or other specifications of quarters. This uniformity is necessary to ensure that these new quarters will continue to work in vending machines, telephones, parking meters, and for other similar transactions. 
This program would operate for 10 years, with the Mint producing five different statehood coins per year. The order in which States will be represented is based on the order in which States ratified the Constitution and joined the Union. If a new state joins the Union during the life of the program, it will be extended in order to ensure that the new State is represented. 
The design for each State will be selected by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Governor, the Commission on Fine Arts, and the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. Each State will nominate a design to the Secretary. 
It is my hope that this proposal will spark interest in every State across our Nation. I hope that school children begin to study the history of their States in search of an appropriate individual or emblem to represent their States on the reverse side of these quarters. I hope that artists, coin collectors, historians, and scholars debate and ultimately join together to suggest an appropriate representation for their State. 
I know that there are a wide range of appealing options for my own State of Rhode Island. Of course there is the founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams or Anne Hutchinson, who, like Roger Williams, dedicated her life to the principle of religious freedom and tolerance. There is the Anchor of Hope, which is our State motto and is represented on our flag. Rhode Island is the Ocean State, so a seascape would be an interesting proposal, as would be a lighthouse or a gull. 
I am delighted to have Senator D'Amato's support in introducing this bill. I am sure that he agrees that the point of this new program is to honor all 50 States, and to encourage an interest in the unique history of each State. This program creates a program through which we can celebrate our diverse heritage. 
I send a bill to the desk and ask for its appropriate referral.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, 
I am pleased to introduce the Promotion of Adoption, Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children Act, the so-called PASS Act. This legislation will make critical reforms to the Nation's child welfare and foster care system and will go a long way toward improving the lives of the hundreds of thousands of abused and neglected children across America. These are children without a safe family setting. They are children who face abuse and neglect every day of their lives. They are America's forgotten children. And, all too often, they are children without hope. 
This chilling picture has brought the sponsors of this bill together to take immediate action. The goals of the PASS Act are twofold: to ensure that abused and neglected children are in safe settings, and to move children more rapidly out of the foster care system and into permanent placements. 
While the goal of reunifying children with their biological families is laudable, we should not be encouraging States to return abused or neglected children to homes that are clearly unsafe. Regrettably, this is occurring under current law. 
About 500,000--half a million--abused or neglected children currently live outside their homes, either in foster care or with relatives. In Rhode Island alone, there are nearly 1,500 children who have been removed from their homes and are in foster care. The Rhode Island Department of Children and Families has an active case load of about 7,700 children who have been abused or neglected. 
Many of these children will be able to return to their parents, but many will not. Too often, children who cannot return to their parents wait for years in foster care before they are adopted. In today's child welfare system, it has become a lonely and tragic wait with no end. To us, that is an unacceptable way of life for any child to have to endure. 
The PASS Act seeks to shorten the time a child must wait to be adopted, all the while ensuring that wherever a child is placed, his or her safety and health will be the first concern. 
The PASS Act also contains important new financial incentives to help these children find adoptive homes. State agencies will receive bonuses for each child that is adopted, and families who open their hearts and their homes to these children will be eligible for Federal financial assistance and Medicaid coverage for the child. 
I believe the PASS Act is a good bipartisan, compromise package. The sponsors of this bill have worked hard to come together in support of a child welfare reform bill. And we expect this new, revised legislation to 
move quickly through the Senate, as the Majority Leader has indicated that adoption legislation is one of a select few priorities to be dealt with before expected adjournment in early November. 
But the real reason we need to move this bill is not because of legislative haste. It is because each passing day we do not act to bring hope and relief to abused and neglected children is a dark day for Congress and the Nation.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, every so often we are put in a difficult situation with amendments presented by somebody we have great affection and respect for, yet we are not in a position to agree with the amendment. Such is the instance here where we are now wrestling with the amendment presented by the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, with whom I have had the privilege of working on the Environment Committee and who is a very valuable member of that committee. Just yesterday we worked closely on a very major piece of legislation which unanimously came out of the committee, and part of the reason it was so successful in the committee was because of the help from the Senator from Arkansas. 
But I must say I think he is making a mountain out of a molehill here, if you would. Maybe I ought to put it in river terms in some fashion. What occurred was in the State of the Union Address the President announced a plan to create initiatives designed to assist communities in their efforts to clean up and restore rivers and riverfront areas. 
Last week, he signed an Executive order creating the American heritage rivers initiative. He had previously announced that he was going to do it and had used that term, American heritage rivers. 
This amendment would, in my judgment, derail that designation and add a whole series of complexities to it that I will touch on in a minute. Since the announcement of this initiative in the State of the Union Address, communities along two major rivers in my State, the Blackstone River and the Woonasquatucket River, have been invigorated by the hope of gaining this designation. They have had rallies and gatherings, and I have had the privilege of attending some of those. I could not help but think, when the President announced this initiative, that he was describing an ongoing project we have in our State. It is the so-called Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor which was created by legislation that I authored some 10 years ago. 
In my years as Governor and first few years in the Senate, I came to view the Blackstone River as a nearly impossible problem. Many years of pollution from toxic substances had wiped out much of the wildlife along the river, and there had been terrific economic change. What once were great mills there had moved away or been abandoned and, indeed, it was a languishing situation. 
Once this designation was made, as a result of technical 
assistance and advice from the National Park Service, a modest investment of Federal funds, enormous commitment from the local communities, business people, and residents, this whole area is experiencing a renaissance. 
Today, community leaders from the Blackstone River Valley are sharing what they have learned with individuals from the other rivers, the Woonasquatucket, for example, and they are working together on an application for designation as an American heritage river. They want this designation. Individuals from the communities are writing the President, sharing their thoughts with him what the rivers mean to them, and we know this is a competitive situation. I must say I didn't know the whole Connecticut River was seeking it, and that is a powerful aggregation. They are favored. It goes through, I guess, three or four States--starting up on the Canadian border and coming down Vermont and New Hampshire and Connecticut, Massachusetts. However, we are very anxious that our rivers, the Blackstone and the Woonasquatucket, taking the two together, would receive this designation.

Mr. CHAFEE. Section (d) of the Executive order says the following. I think this is important: 
Agencies shall act with due regard for the protection of private property provided by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 
That is what it says. There is nothing in this Executive order that interferes with the rights of individual property owners along the rivers. Nominations for this designation must come from the communities and have to be supported by a broad range of individuals. Once the designations are made, if a community finds it no longer wants to be an American heritage river, it can opt out. They are not bound into this thing. It is a very modest program. They get a designation. They get somebody from the Federal Government, one of the agencies that will help the communities along the river, do some things that will improve the quality of life along the river, make the river a more attractive entity in their lives. 
As I say, the Federal role in these areas is limited to supporting community-based efforts to protect and restore the rivers. So I support the President's plan to designate 10 rivers. I support the goals of the initiative which are to protect natural resources, encourage economic revitalization, and preserve historic and cultural treasures, and I vigorously support the efforts of the communities that I mentioned along the Blackstone River which is part in Massachusetts and part in Rhode Island, and the Woonasquatucket River to get this coveted designation. 
I would like to close, Mr. President, by touching on the Senator's amendment, but I want to underscore that applications for this designation have to come from the communities. This is not some President in Washington reaching out and saying that this river is going to be an American heritage river. It can only come about through the community seeking that designation. It has to have support from local residents. As I say, if they do not want to be in it any longer, they can get out. 
So for those reasons I reluctantly oppose the amendment of my distinguished colleague from Arkansas. 
The Senator from Arkansas read his amendment, and there are a couple of things in there that I find troublesome and I must say I am not quite sure what they mean. In the prioritization section, he says: 
The nominations shall be subject to the prioritization process established by the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and other applicable law. 
Now, it may well be, I suspect, that under the Clean Water Act the prioritization is those rivers that are what we call most unclean, if you want to use that word, or the ones that are the 
most polluted. This is not geared solely toward a river cleanup in the sense of pollution control. That, of course, comes under the Clean Water Act. The Senator is quite right; that is an important part of prioritization of the Clean Water Act. 
But this isn't the way, as I understand it, this act is to work. It isn't solely the President reaching out and saying we are going to designate the dirtiest rivers as American Heritage rivers because they need the most help. There is very little financial help from the Federal Government, totally unlike the Clean Water Act where there are massive grants, as the distinguished Senator knows, for wastewater treatment facilities, either municipal or the law, of course, forces the private companies that pollute in any fashion to clean up their act. That is not what this is designed for. 
It goes on--and this is the point the Senator from Connecticut was making, that the provisions in this act really add a great layer of bureaucracy and red tape on top of what is an innocent process just getting the designation. 
Example: 
Consultation With Property Owners: 
To ensure the protection of private property owners along the rivers proposed for nomination, all-- 
All, every single-- property owners holding title to land directly abutting the river shall be consulted. 
Now, this can go on forever, trying to find who is along the river. Are they a tenant? Do they own it? What proportion of ownership do we have? In my State, we have factories that have been abandoned. They are owned by families that have disappeared. It is very hard to trace the ownership and find out who exactly lives there and owns the property. 
Then we get to definition of a river community, in which the Senator says, `For the purposes of the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, as used in the Executive order, the term river community' shall include all persons that own property, reside or regularly conduct business within 10 miles of the river.' 
Now, I am not sure what the Senator means by that, but that is an impossible job, to bring in every person who lives within 10 miles of the river--lives there, owns property, or regularly conducts business. I don't know what that means. Suppose I am a regular attendee at a coffee shop along the river somewhere; I don't live within 10 miles, but I have lunch every day at this coffee shop. Do I fall under the term `river community'? 
So for those reasons, Mr. President--and again, I would be open to explanation on this river community definition that the Senator includes--I hope that this amendment will not be accepted.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, for years during consideration of the Interior appropriations bill, the Senate has debated the fate of the National Endowment for the Arts. Those debates have had mixed results. On one hand, NEA funding has been severely reduced. On the other hand, the NEA has made changes in its policies and operation to safeguard against providing Federal dollars to distasteful and, yes, perhaps, inappropriate projects. So, some bad and some good has come from our discussions here. 
Now, we are in the midst of another such debate. The House voted to eliminate funding for the NEA. It even rejected a proposal to provide $10 million in close down costs. There are Senators who support the House and have offered amendments to eliminate funding for the NEA altogether. Others would eliminate the Endowment by providing all of the appropriated dollars directly to the States in the form of block grants based on State populations. Still others would allow the Endowment to continue but would vastly diminish its role by sending the lion's share of funding to the States as block grants. 
Earlier this summer, I introduced legislation with Senators Jeffords and Kennedy to reauthorize both the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities for 5 years. The Labor and Human Resources Committee marked up the bill and reported it from the committee on a bipartisan basis. According to our bill, 40 percent of funds would go to State arts agencies, 40 percent would be used by the Endowment to support projects of national significance, 10 percent would be for direct grants, and the remaining 10 percent would go to arts education in underserved communities. All funds appropriated beyond the current level of $99 million also would go to arts education. 
My colleagues might wonder: Why this emphasis on arts education? All across the Nation, arts education is being integrated into the core curriculum of schools. This integration is the result of the realization that an arts education can help students to develop better skills in analysis, problem solving, and just plain thinking. This is in addition to nurturing and developing the child's imagination and creativity. 
A study by the College Entrance Examination Board found that students who have studied the arts regularly outperform students who do not have an arts background on SAT exams. According to the study, students who have studied the arts for 4 years score 53 points higher on the verbal SAT exam and 35 points higher in math than do students who lack arts education. 
Senator Gorton recognizes the importance of continuing to fund the National Endowment for the Arts. The bill he has brought before us even provides a small increase to the NEA, from $99 to $100 million. The NEA costs each American less than 38 cents per year. My colleagues might be interested to know that a recent Lou Harris poll showed overwhelming support among the American people for arts funding, even if it meant a tax increase. For this minute investment of 38 cents per year, the American people get orchestras, chamber music ensembles, children's festivals, operas, poetry readings, concerts in the parks, music festivals, Shakespeare festivals, artists visiting schools, museum and gallery exhibits, dance troupes, and much more. For this tiny investment, local communities in rural areas far from our Nation's cultural centers are able to experience our rich artistic traditions. 
According to BusinessWeek magazine, the arts support 1.3 million jobs. The arts contribute $36.8 billion annually to our economy, and 6 percent of the GNP is attributable to nonprofit arts activities. 
In Rhode Island, we count our artists among our State's natural resources, among the resources that are contributing to a wonderful revitalization, particularly evident in Providence. We are very fortunate to be home to one of the most prestigious art schools in the Nation, Rhode Island School of Design. RISD draws young artists to Rhode Island from around the globe. Perhaps because of our State's marvelous quality of life or perhaps because of the efforts of community leaders and State officials to develop an atmosphere in which the arts can flourish, many of these fine art students stay and contribute to our community and to our economy. 
Let me share a few excerpts from a letter I received 
earlier this summer from Roger Mandle, President of RISD. Mr Mandle writes: 
Federal support for the arts and humanities is more than a symbolic matter, and helps to leverage strong state and local private sector support for operas, dance companies, symphonies and museums. Students of schools and colleges gain access, some for the first time, as performers or audiences for these cultural activities. Cities and towns benefit from the tourism generated by the institutions and events they sponsor. Federal inspiration to maintain and support America's cultural heritage comes at a small price to every citizen. The existence of these Endowments helps to compare ourselves favorably to other nations whose governmental support for the arts exceeds that of the United States by many times. 
Some critics of the NEA suggest that supporting the arts should be left up to the private sector. They contend that there is no purpose for Federal support and that the arts would do just fine without it. Mr. President, you may be interested to know that since the creation of the NEA 30 years ago, the number of nonprofit theaters has grown from 56 to more than 400; the number of orchestras has quadrupled to more than 200; the number of opera companies has grown from 27 to more than 100; the number of dance companies has increased from 30 to about 250; and today there are more than 3,000 public arts agencies in small cities and towns throughout the United States. There is no doubt in my mind that the NEA, whose budget is seven-tenths of 1 percent of federal spending, has had a sizable contribution in making the arts accessible to all Americans, rather than to an elite few. 
I was curious about the idea of providing block grants to the States. Surely, that would mean more money to the State arts agencies, and they would be all for it. But, of course, that is not the case at all. I asked Randall Rosenbaum, executive director of the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, what he thought of either providing the entire appropriated amount for the NEA directly to the States in the form of block grants, or increasing the size of the State block grants by scaling back NEA grants to projects of national significance. Here is what Mr. Rosenbaum had to say:  
While the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts might, on appearance, benefit from such a move (we would not), the Nation as a whole would suffer immeasurably. The Federal Government's leadership in arts funding has been critical to State and local efforts to raise matching dollars from public and private sources to support the arts. Stacks of research support this point . . . 
More to the point, if the money is just block granted to the States, we will lose one of the most precious things the NEA has to offer, leadership in development of public policy in support of the arts. A strong federal presence through the arts endowment has changed the nature of an arts field I have worked in since 1976. Through its consensus building, policy making, and yes, financial support, I have seen more emphasis on access for all Americans to the arts. NEA-supported projects in Rhode Island ensure that everyone, from toddlers to seniors, experiences the arts on a personal level. 
The NEA supports the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra, and I have heard from many of its musicians writing in strong support of continued funding. It provides funds to the Trinity Repertoire Co., to RISD and to Brown University. But it also provides funds to smaller, less well known theater and dance companies, such as `Lydia Perez and Ensemble' whom I was privileged to hear at a gathering in Providence in July. Ms. Perez specializes in bomba' music. Grants have gone to the All Children's Theater Ensemble in Providence, to the Blackstone Valley Tourism Council, to the Capeverdean American Community Development Center in Pawtucket, to the Children's Museum of Rhode Island, to the Festival Ballet of Rhode Island, to the Island Arts Center in Newport, to the Ocean State Light Opera, and to literally dozens of other community arts groups. 
Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support Senator Gorton's efforts to continue to fund the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and I support Senator Jeffords as he works to reauthorize both Endowments for 5 years. I urge my colleagues to reject efforts to eliminate the Endowments, either by cutting funding or by creating block grants to the States.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor, along with Senators Kempthrone, Baucus, and Reid, the Endangered Species Recovery Act of 1997, which reauthorizes the Endangered Species Act, and makes some significant improvements to the act which are long overdue. The Endangered Species Act was enacted into law in 1973 to conserve threatened and endangered species, and the ecosystems upon which they depend. The ESA is our most important law to protect our Nation's natural resources and biological diversity, and has often been referred to as the `crown jewel' of environmental laws. 
The ESA has been instrumental in saving some of our country's most treasured species. The bald eagle and the grizzly bear have both rebounded from precariously small populations, and the Pacific grey whale and American alligator have both recovered and have been delisted. All told, almost half of the species that fall under the act's protection are either stabilized or improving. 
One can understand better the vital need for the ESA when one realizes what we are up against: of somewhere between 10 and 100 million species on this planet, we have discovered only some 1.4 million. Despite this bounty, loss of biological diversity is taking place at a faster rate than ever before. In 1973, Congress offered this poignant observation: `as we homogenize the habitats in which these plants and animals evolved . . . we threaten their--and our own--genetic heritage. The value of this genetic heritage, is quite literally, incalculable.' It was principally for this reason that Congress passed the ESA in 1973. 
Controversy has surrounded the law, however, since its passage. In the mid-1970's, the law became ensnarled in a bitter fight over the construction of the $900 million Tellico Dam and the dam's impacts on the hapless snail darter. The criticism has grown significantly since 1992, when the most recent authorization of the ESA expired. 
Since then, funding for implementing the law has been provided through annual appropriations, which has left the future of the law on uncertain terms, and left the current working of the law subject to numerous appropriations riders, including a moratorium on the listing of species, that resulted in more than a year delay in affording protection to hundreds of species endangered with extinction. 
The bill we introduce today includes many reforms. The last major amendment to the ESA was in 1988, almost 10 years ago. Since then, we have developed a greater knowledge of the science of biodiversity, a greater understanding of the problems in implementing the law on private lands, and in this era of shrinking government, a greater need for improved coordination among all levels of government. Our bill takes all this into account by focusing on several key areas: emphasizing recovery as the ultimate goal; seeking to prevent further listings; improving the scientific foundation for decisions; increasing public participation and the role of States; facilitating compliance by, and providing incentives for, private landowners; and streamlining coordination among government agencies. In making these changes, our bill addresses the criticisms leveled against the ESA in recent years. 
These criticisms have come from all directions. The environmental community believes that the law has failed in its fundamental mission to recover species to full health, but rather leaves species teetering on the razor's edge of survival. Statistics bear this out: of the approximately 1,000 species currently listed, 41 percent are either improving in status or stabilized, but only 8 percent are actually improving. Furthermore, less than half of the listed species have approved recovery plans. 
Private landowners, on the other hand, believe that the ESA is fundamentally flawed in its implementation, with inflexible regulations, heavy-handed enforcement, closed-door science, and no consideration of economic costs. This, too, is largely borne out by the facts: the ESA has very few tools, other than enforcement of certain prohibitions against taking listed species, with which to protect species on private lands. This weakness in the law is heightened by the fact that more than one-third of all listed species reside entirely on private lands. Furthermore, species on private lands are faring worse than on public lands. 
If the ESA is to succeed in its ultimate goal of recovering species, these problems must be addressed. Our bill does just that. Most importantly, it completely overhauls the recovery planning and implementation requirements of the ESA. Previously, recovery plans were required to be prepared, but with no deadline for doing so. Once prepared, they generally sat on the shelves with no requirement or incentive to implement them. Furthermore, the scientific findings in the plans were often compromised by political and economic considerations, nor was there any requirement to actually take cost of implementation into account. 
This bill requires that recovery plans be completed within a specific deadline. The recovery goal must be developed by scientists, using only the best science available. While economic costs and social impacts must be taken into account, they are considered only in choosing the best method to achieve the biologically based recovery goals. Specifically, measure to achieve the recovery goal must strike an `appropriate balance' among three factors: The effectiveness in meeting the goal; the period of time needed to reach the goal; and the social and economic impacts. 
For the first time, the bill provides a requirement that Federal agencies enter into recovery implementation agreements, and also provides incentives for private persons to enter into similar agreements. These incentives include a waiver of consultation normally required under section 7 for actions that are described in sufficient detail. They also include a requirement that Federal agencies participate in the development of an agreement upon the request of a private person, so that the person will know up-front all relevant requirements in undertaking conservation actions. 
The bill also improves significantly the law's ability to work on private lands. Under the current law, the permit process has generally been inflexible, cumbersome, and consequently rarely used. The Clinton administration recently instituted a number of policies to encourage landowners to apply for permits in order to conduct economic activities that take listed species on their lands. As a result, the number of permits issued by the 
administration has increased from 14 in 1992 to more than 200 in 1997, with an additional 250 being developed. Our bill validates and expands those policies. 
The bill authorizes permits for multiple species, including both listed and nonlisted species, that depend on the same habitat. New biological standards for nonlisted species ensure that permitted activities do not contribute to the need to list those species in the future. In order to address the needs of small landowners, a more streamlined, less expensive permit process is established for low effect activities. Under this process,the permit can take effect automatically within a certain period, provided that there are no significant adverse comments. 
In addition, the bill authorizes several policies and incentives to further encourage landowners to work with the Federal Government. These policies include a no-surprises guarantee that the Government will not seek additional mitigation over time; a safe harbor policy to encourage landowners to protect lands valuable to species without risking additional liability; and a candidate conservation policy, which encourages landowners to undertake protections for species before they become endangered or threatened. The bill also establishes several new funding mechanisms for incentive-based programs, including a habitat reserve program, and a habitat conservation planning fund, which acts as a revolving loan fund. A program to provide technical assistance to landowners is also created. 
The bill also makes important changes to the consultation process among Federal agencies. It encourages consultations to be consolidated if they involve related actions by one agency, or they involve several agencies affecting the same species. The consultation process is streamlined by allowing the Federal agency undertaking an action to make the initial determination whether its action affects listed species, and providing an opportunity for the Fish and Wildlife Service, or, for marine species, the National Marine Fisheries Service, to comment on this determination. The Service has 60 days to object, and require a more detailed analysis that it would prepare. This process is similar to the current practice that is used by the agencies. 
The bill also addresses the relationship between site-specific and programmatic Federal land management actions. Several recent lawsuits enjoined numerous site-specific actions pending completion of the consultation on the overarching programmatic action. The bill explicitly recognizes that consultation is appropriate and required at both levels of decisionmaking, but ensures an orderly process for completing those consultations. In addition, the bill affords greater participation in the consultation process for any person who has sought authorization or funding from a Federal agency. 
The bill goes a long way in improving the scientific basis on which decisions are made. The greatest lack of knowledge is in the status and distribution of rare and declining species. This bill requires an inventory of species on Federal lands to fill this critical data gap. Listing decisions must be peer-reviewed, and petitions to list are subject to certain minimum information requirements. Enforcement actions must use scientifically valid principles 
to establish whether the action caused an unlawful taking of a species. In evaluating comparable data, the Secretary would be required to use peer reviewed, field tested or empirical data. 
As you can see, Mr. President, this bill not only reauthorizes the ESA, but it also significantly improves the ESA, in order to embrace needed reforms in the law. Numerous attempts to reauthorize the ESA have been made in recent years. The long and arduous effort culminating in today's bill began more than 18 months ago, as a bipartisan process to address the problems with the current law. When discussions stalled, Senator Kempthorne and I spurred the process forward by releasing a discussion draft, which generated hundreds of comments. Since then, we have negotiated with Senators Baucus and Reid, and the Clinton administration, to reach agreement on a bipartisan bill. 
Just as the original ESA was passed by a Democratic Congress and signed into law by a Republican President, this bill to reauthorize the ESA is also a bipartisan product between a Republican Senate and a Democratic administration. To quote one of the foremost conservationists of our country, President Teddy Roosevelt, the conservation of natural resources is a question `upon which men of all parties and all shades of opinion may be united for the common good.' The need for a healthy environment, one large enough for all species that inhabit this planet with us, is a need that transcends politics, and I firmly believe that the bill we introduce today fulfills that need, as embodied in the original passage of the ESA. 
I would like to thank my distinguished colleagues, Senators Kempthorne, Baucus, and Reid, for their tireless work over the months on this important legislation, and I would like to thank the Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, as well as his very accomplished staff, led by Jaimie Clark, Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, and Don Barry, Acting Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks, for their willingness to work with us in negotiating a bill that they can support.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Intermodal Transportation Act of 1997, a comprehensive, 6-year measure to reauthorize the Nation's Federal aid-highway, highway safety, and other surface transportation programs. I am particularly pleased to be doing so with 10 of my colleagues from the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Warner and Senator Baucus, Senators Bond, Thomas, Kempthorne, Reid, Graham, Smith, Allard, Inhofe; as well as Senators Dorgan, Harkin, and Grassley. As you can tell from the list of names I just read, this bill truly represents a consensus effort, with cosponsors from all regions of the country and from both sides of the aisle. 
This legislation is the product of well over a year of hard work and careful negotiation. Some say that it has taken a long time to get to this point, but we had three very different proposals--all commendable--to coalesce into one unified plan that we can rally around. We also could not put together a serious proposal before we knew the amount of money we had for transportation under the budget agreement. 
The result of these efforts, the Intermodal Transportation Act of 1997 [ITA], provides $145 billion over the next 6 years to keep our Nation's transportation system up and running. This bill preserves and builds upon the laudable goals of ISTEA--intermodalism and efficiency. More important, it does so in a manner that: First, stays within a balanced budget; second, enhances highway and driver safety; and finally, protects the environment. 
First, I want to stress that the Intermodal Transportation Act is fiscally responsible and fiscally innovative. In my view, the most important aspect of this bill is that it works within the context of a balanced budget. This is essential. On America's highways, you get to where you are going by staying within the lines and playing by the rules. That should be our guide when it comes to the budget as well. 
To maximize limited Federal funds, strategic investment in transportation is critical. Forty years ago, it made sense for the Nation to build an interstate highway system. Today, however, we must be more creative. Simply building more roads and highways is no longer a workable solution. We must carefully plan and allocate our limited resources. 
The bill before us includes a number of innovative ways to finance our formidable transportation needs. It establishes a federal credit assistance program for surface transportation. The provision is identical to S. 986, the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, which I introduced in the Senate earlier this year. This new program leverages limited Federal funds by allowing up to a $10 billion Federal line-of-credit for transportation projects, at a cost to the Federal budget of just over $500 million. The bill also provides tools, such as the State Infrastructure Bank Program, to enable States to make the most of their transportation dollars. 
Second, this legislation substantially increases the Federal commitment to safety. I am very concerned about the safety of our Nation's highways, and I am particularly alarmed by the escalating incidence of highway motor vehicle injuries and fatalities. In the United States alone, there are more than 40,000 fatalities and 3.5 million automobile crashes every year. Between 1992 and 1995, the average highway fatality rate increased by more than 2,000 lives, while the annual injury rate increased by over 380,000. We must work vigorously to reverse this trend, and this bill will help us do so. The funds set-aside for safety programs such as hazard elimination and railway-highway crossings under this bill totals $690 million dollars per year, almost a 55-percent increase over the current level. 
Often, it is a safety belt that can make the difference between saving a life and becoming another tragic statistic. The bill establishes a new State safety belt incentive program, rewarding those States that increase their seat belt use rate or take other measures to promote seat belt use. It provides an average of $83 million per year from the highway trust fund to pay for the new incentives program. 
The ITA establishes a new program that, through economic sanctions, encourages States to enact laws and minimum penalties for repeat drunk driving offenders. The bill also establishes a new border infrastructure and safety program to address safety concerns that have resulted from NAFTA, such as deteriorating roads and bridges in our border States. I can assure you that safety is an uncompromising priority of the legislation before us. 
Third, the Intermodal Transportation Act upholds ISTEA's strong commitment to preserving and protecting our environment. As valuable as transportation is to our society through the movement of goods and people, it takes a heavy toll on the Nation's air, land, and water. The costs of air pollution that can be attributed to cars and trucks range from $30 to $200 billion per year. Passenger cars alone account for almost 30 percent of the Nation's total oil consumption. 
ISTEA provided States and localities with tools to cope with the growing demands on our transportation system and the corresponding strain on our environment. I am proud that the bill before us increases funding for ISTEA's key programs to offset transportation's impact on the environment. 
The bill before us provides an average of $1.18 billion per year over the next 6 years for the CMAQ, or Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement, Program. That's an 18-percent increase over the current funding levels for transit improvements, shared ride services, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities, to help fight air pollution. 
Highway construction can be a destructive impact on a community and its surrounding environment. To redress some of the damage highways have done in the past, the bill increases funding for enhancement activities to $552 million per year, a 24-percent increase over the current law. Enhancement money can be used for a variety of projects, such as billboard removal, historic preservation, and the Rails-to-Trails Program. 
We must recognize that caring for our precious natural heritage and expanding transportation infrastructure can go hand in hand. The bill establishes a new wetlands restoration pilot program. The purpose of the program is to fund projects to offset the loss or degradation of wetlands resulting from Federal-aid transportation projects. It also establishes a new pilot program to integrate transportation, development and the environment, and to preserve communities. 
When it was enacted in 1991, ISTEA expanded the focus of national policy, transforming what was once simply a highway program into a surface transportation program, dedicated to the mobility of passengers and goods. And it recognized, for the first time, that the individual transportation modes function best as a cohesive and interrelated system. 
Admittedly, the transition from old policies and practices to those embodied in ISTEA has not always been easy. The two complaints we have heard time and again from the States are that ISTEA's program structure is too complicated and its formulas are not fair. The bill before us will carry forward ISTEA's strengths but it also will correct ISTEA's weaknesses, and provide a responsive transportation program to take us into the next century. 
The Intermodal Transportation Act addresses the concerns of the States by making the program easier to understand and by providing real flexibility to States and localities. It reduces the number of ISTEA program categories from 5 to 3, and it includes more than 20 improvements to reduce the redtape involved in carrying out transportation projects. The bill also expands the eligibility of NHS and surface transportation funds to passenger rail, such as AMTRAK, and intelligent transportation systems. 
Moreover, the Intermodal Transportation Act significantly reforms the ISTEA funding formulas to balance the diverse needs of the various regions of the Nation. It guarantees 90 cents back for every dollar a State contributes to the highway trust fund. Fortynine of the fifty States share in the growth of the overall program. The bill also recognizes the diversity and uniqueness of the country and all of its transportation needs. 
By making the surface transportation program more responsive to all regions of the country, this bill will ensure that the laudable goals of the original ISTEA--intermodalism and efficiency--are upheld. Finding the right solutions to address all of our needs requires strategic and comprehensive approaches to transportation policy. 
Before I conclude, I want to give a special thanks to Senators Warner and Baucus for their hard work and determination in developing this legislation. It has not been easy, and we still have a long way to go. But I look forward to working with the other members of the Environment and Public Works Committee and all Members of the Senate, as well as the House leadership, to enact a bill this year that will take the Nation's transportation system into the 21st century.

Mr. CHAFEE. That is correct. Even though we are designating wildlife observation, hunting, fishing, and environmental education as priority public uses the bill requires each of these to pass the compatibility test. Even these uses have occasionally been determined to be incompatible on a number of refuges in the past and may be so in the future.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have introduced this amendment to H.R. 1420, the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 on behalf of myself, Senator Kempthorne, and Senator Graham. This bill recently passed the House by the remarkable vote of 407 to 1. 
Last week, I, along with Senators Kempthorne and Graham, introduced S. 1059 as a companion bill, and on July 30, the Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing to solicit views on this bill from the Secretary of the Interior, among others. The hearing was very productive, and reaffirmed the widespread support that exists for this legislation. The amendment that I am offering includes narrow, but important, changes to the House version that clarify several provisions, and that have been agreed to by the administration, the House Resources Committee, and the stakeholders involved in the earlier negotiations. 
This legislation is long overdue and very much needed. The National Wildlife Refuge System was started in 1903 by President Theodore Roosevelt, with the establishment of the first refuge on Pelican Island in Florida. It has since evolved into a system of Federal lands consisting of 509 refuges in 50 States, covering 92 million acres, for the conservation of fish, wildlife, and plants. Despite 60 years of growth, however the refuge system remained without a law governing its administration until 1966, when Congress passed the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act. Even now, almost a century later, there is no law that identifies a mission or articulates guidance for refuge management. 
For several years, both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol have attempted to enact legislation to rectify this situation. The President has also taken administrative steps for improving refuge management with an Executive order issued in March 1996. Earlier this year, after a month of negotiations among a broad range of stakeholders, the House passed H.R. 1420, which was then referred to the Senate. 
After discussions here in the Senate, we have this amendment that makes narrow but important changes to H.R. 1420, and that clarifies the intent expressed by the House in the report of the Committee on Resources and in deliberation on the floor. The first two provisions of the amendment were changes included in S. 1059. This amendment clarifies that compatible uses can be both wildlife-dependent and other uses. The allowance of compatible uses has become the cornerstone of the refuge system, balancing the needs of the fish, wildlife, and plants for which the refuge was established, with our own ability to use and enjoy the refuge for a wide range of activities. Two points should be emphasized, however. First, while this legislation establishes that wildlife-dependent recreational uses are to be given priority, any use may be authorized by the refuge manager provided that it is compatible with both the mission of the system and the purpose of the refuge. These are two separate principles contained in the bill. Second, that all uses are required to be compatible in order to be allowed does not mean that all compatible uses are required to be allowed. The longstanding policy of the Fish and 
Wildlife Service that a refuge is `closed until open' is not altered by this legislation, although wildlife-dependent uses may be approved on an interim basis pending completion of the conservation plan for any land added to the system after March 25, 1996. 
The amendment requires that the Secretary provide for monitoring of the status and trends of fish, wildlife, and plants on refuges. While this provision seems somewhat obvious, monitoring is often one of the first casualties of budgetary constraints. In addition, given some of the past problems with secondary uses on refuges, monitoring will be very important in measuring the success of the recent administrative and legislative changes that we are now undertaking. Lastly, monitoring will ensure that our scientific knowledge regarding wildlife and natural resources continues to grow. 
The amendment clarifies the legislative intent regarding the periodic reevaluation on longterm secondary uses, such as electric utility rights-of-way. The bill requires that nonwildife dependent uses be reevaluated no less than every 10 years. Some rights-of-way are authorized for longer periods of time, and concern has been expressed that this reevaluation, together with the requirement that incompatible uses be eliminated or modified, may threaten the very existence of the rights-of-way. For uses that are authorized for periods of longer than 10 years, this amendment limits the review to compliance with the terms and conditions under which the authorization is made, and not to the authorization itself. 
Numerous individuals in both the Senate and the House, as well as in the administration, deserve praise for their persevering efforts over the years in seeking to improve the refuge system, and for their involvement on this bill. On the Senate side, I would like to thank Senators Kempthorne and Graham for their support on this amendment. I would also like to thank Senators Murkowski and Allard for their understanding on issues relating to rights-of-way and water rights on which they have expressed concern. 
With this amendment, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 1420.

Mr. CHAFEE. As a preliminary matter, numerous rights-of-way have been approved in the past as compatible uses in various refuges, and this legislation does not alter the basis under which those activities may be approved in the future. With respect to the periodic reviews, the reevaluation of existing uses is required `when conditions under which the use is permitted change significantly or when there is significant new information regarding the effects of the use, but not less frequently than once every 10 years.' For uses that are authorized for periods of less than 10 years, it is my understanding that the Fish and Wildlife Service will, under normal and usual circumstances, review the use at the time of the reauthorization of the activity. The only exception to this would be in situations in which significant new information is developed regarding the effects of the use, or conditions under which the use change significantly.

Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I am delighted to be here today to support Senator Harkin's important amendment in the fight against teenage smoking. 
The attorney general of my home State of Rhode Island has urged Congress to provide the full funding level of $34 million requested by the Food and Drug Administration. Our attorney general believes adequate funding is critical to our success in reducing the level of smoking among children and adolescents, and I agree with him. 
Furthermore, with the evidence that we now have regarding the epidemic of teen smoking as outlined by the distinguished Senator from Iowa, and all the implications this has for the future, it seems to me there is no excuse for delaying full implementation of this critical program. 
As has been pointed out, smoking among high school seniors is at a 17-year high. That is very discouraging. Smoking among 8th and 10th graders has increased by more than 50 percent in the last 6 years. State and local officials need this money for enforcement purposes. And the money is also needed to educate retailers about their responsibilities. 
In my home State, even though we have a law prohibiting retailers from selling tobacco products to minors, over 70 percent of high school smokers were not asked to show proof of their age when purchasing cigarettes. 
According to our attorney general, Rhode Island stores each year are selling--I was stunned by this figure. We are a small State, a million people--11 million dollars' worth of cigarettes to underage consumers, and the main reason, of course, is the lack of resources at the local level to enforce the law. We have been able to provide the funds for education. We have to be able, in my judgment, to provide funds for education and enforcement of this rule to make it meaningful. 
Now, there is a little less than $5 million provided thus far by the Senate. That is nice, but it just plain is not enough. With the improvement of the sunset provisions in the new offset, I believe there is no good reason not to vote for this amendment. Preventing underage smoking should be a national priority and providing full funding of this program is an important step toward achieving that goal. So I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to eradicate teenage smoking. 
I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa for his leadership.

Mr. CHAFEE. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank and acknowledge the tremendous work of the Senator from Louisiana in connection with the Medicare reforms that we undertook. No one was a stouter soul in that effort to face up to what had to be done if we are going to continue to have Medicare. It was the Senator from Louisiana who joined in leading the effort, in having the means testing in the part B premium and raising the eligibility age to 67 and having a copayment, a payment for the home health care visits, of 7 percent. 
I share the disappointment that the Senator from Louisiana has voiced in that these elements we worked on did not survive. But I see others here. The distinguished Senator from New York was right in the lead in these efforts. All I can say is, disappointed though we were, despite the overwhelming vote that took place on the floor of the Senate on both the means testing and the raising of the eligibility age, up or down votes--one got 70 votes, the means testing, 70 to 30, and the other got something like 62 to 38, in that neighborhood, over 60 votes, in raising the age to 67--they didn't survive the conference because of objections from the other body. 
But this is what I want to say, Mr. President. Disappointing as that was, nonetheless it showed that it could be done, and now it is an accepted fact in this Senate that all three of those elements are necessary, and the votes are there to sustain them and make them part of any further legislation. 
So now we have a commission, and as was pointed out, there is no reporting date for the commission. There is no fast track consideration for the commission. I may be wrong in the reporting date. 
March 1, 1999, I am informed. Well, it is not exactly tomorrow. However, there is no fast-track procedure; in other words, that it has to be considered, has to be voted on up or down, one way or another. It could be like so many other commissions we have had in this body. 
Mr. President, disappointed though we might be in those particular facts, those particular undertakings, nonetheless we have made some substantial achievements in having them so accepted here. 
Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I applaud the Republican leadership as well as the administration for putting together this tax bill, which is an integral component of the overall plan to balance the Federal budget. While I have not been an enthusiastic supporter of tax cuts at this time, there are provisions in this bill that I have vigorously sought to have enacted, and which will significantly help the people in my home State of Rhode Island, as well as the entire country. 
The centerpiece of the tax bill is the $500 per child tax credit. For a married couple with two children that's an extra $1,000 for them to spend as they see fit. 
The bill also includes several provisions that help families meet the cost of sending their children to college. Under the bill, low- and middle-income families can qualify for income tax credits of up to $1,500 to offset the cost of college tuition. To help families save for education expenses, the bill establishes education savings accounts. Contributions to these accounts are not tax deductible, but distributions are tax-free if used for tuition, room and board expenses. 
I am also pleased that the conferees chose to include an extension of the tax break afforded to employer-provided education. Under current law, an employee is not taxed on amounts paid by an employer for educational assistance. The exclusion is limited to $5,250 annually. The anecdotal evidence indicates that this fringe benefit is most often utilized by lower income workers as a way to develop the skills necessary to land better paying jobs. 
This budget agreement includes several provisions that will encourage savings and investment. The most important of those provisions is the reduction in the tax rate on capital gains. The bill lowers the top rate on capital gains from 28 to 20 percent. For lower income individuals the rate on capital gains is reduced to 10 percent. At the turn of the century, the capital gains tax rate will be reduced further to 18 and 8 percent, respectively, for investors willing to hold their investments for at least 5 years. 
Last year, Congress created the work opportunity tax credit [WOTC] as a way to encourage employers to hire economically disadvantaged individuals. These are individuals who have little or no job skills and as a result are not attractive candidates for employment. The WOTC Program provides employers an income tax credit for a portion of the first year's wages paid to these individuals. The bill before us extends this program through June of next year. 
More importantly, this bill makes two improvements to the WOTC Program. First, the bill creates a two-tiered credit to make it easier for employers to utilize the program. This is necessary because many employers were finding it difficult to retain these employees for the full work requirement period, namely 400 hours, and as a result were losing the benefits of the tax credit. In many cases the employers were spending the money to train the employees only to have them leave shortly thereafter for higher paying jobs. Without some reward for their efforts, employers were simply dropping their programs. 
Under the new structure, employers would be eligible for a reduced credit if the employee works for at least 120 hours, even if the employee fails to meet the full 400 work hour requirement. 
The second change makes the work opportunity tax credit available to disabled individuals receiving SSI payments. These individuals were inexplicably excluded from participation when the WOTC Program was created last year, and I am glad this bill corrects that error. 
The agreement also includes two important provisions for small business men and women. It delays the implementation of the electronic funds tax payment system for 6 months to give businesses more time to get used to this new manner of paying their tax bills. 
The legislation also makes it easier for self-employed individuals who work at home to take an income tax deduction for that portion of the home used exclusively for business purposes. 
The bill also includes the repeal of the excise tax imposed upon boat diesel fuel. This tax, and the dyeing regime imposed by Treasury, has wreaked havoc with boaters across the country. It caused many retailers to choose between selling to recreational or selling to commercial boat owners, with the recreational boaters usually being left without service. This led to shortages in many parts of the country and numerous cases wee reported in which recreational boaters had to go far out of their way or travel many additional hours to obtain fuel legally. 
Finally, I am very pleased that this bill includes a version of legislation I authored that creates a powerful new tax incentive to encourage individuals to preserve open space. A serious environmental problem facing the country today is the loss of open space to development. All across the country, farms, ranches, forests, and wetlands are forced to give way to the pressures for new office buildings, shopping malls and housing developments. 
America is losing over 4 square miles of land to development every day. In Rhode Island, over 11,000 acres of farmland have been lost to development since 1974. These open spaces improve the quality of life for Americans throughout this great Nation and provide important habitat for fish and wildlife. 
In many instances, the loss of open space is simply the natural outgrowth of urbanization of our society. Other times it is the direct result of improper planning at the State and local levels. 
But frequently, the problem is created by the Federal estate tax. For those families where undeveloped land represents a significant portion of the estate's total value, the need to pay the tax creates powerful pressure to develop or sell off part or all of the land or to liquidate the timber resources on the land. Because land is appraised by the Internal Revenue Service according to its highest and best use, and such use is often its development value, the effect of the tax is to make retention of undeveloped land nearly impossible. 
The bill begins to address the problem caused by the 
estate tax. The bill includes a proposal that is modeled after legislation I introduced earlier this year along with Senators Baucus and Gregg. It excludes 40 percent of the value of land subject to a conservation easement from the estate and gift taxes. 
In order to target the incentives under this bill to those areas that are truly at risk for development, the bill is limited to land that falls within a 25-mile radius of a metropolitan area, a national park or a national wilderness area, or within 10 miles of an urban national forest. 
Of course, as is the case with all major bills, there are a few provisions in this agreement that I do not support. One such provision is the restructured aviation trust fund taxes. 
As my colleagues know, currently the aviation trust fund is principally financed by a 10 percent ticket tax. High-cost airlines--the so-called big seven--have been lobbying Congress for the past 2 years to restructure the aviation trust fund revenues. The big seven argue that they want to restructure the fees so that the burdens of funding the Federal Aviation Administration are more fairly allocated. But this proposal does not do that. In reality, it is a thinly veiled attempt to shift a portion of their costs to other airlines--principally low-fare airlines. 
Let me expose the folly of this new system. The big seven would have us believe that their system--which is more or less the proposal adopted by the conferees--is grounded in fairness. Yet, this new system does nothing to address the huge loophole under which they avoid paying the tax on their international flights. 
Let me explain. If Continental Airlines flies from Los Angeles to New York, stops for less than 12 hours, and then continues on to London, the new fee structure does not apply to that flight. In other words, the passengers on that flight do not pay the 7.5 percent ticket tax, nor do they pay the new head tax, notwithstanding the fact that this flight clearly utilizes the services of the Federal Aviation Administration as it flies completely across the country. 
It is particularly regrettable that the conferees have chosen to implement this new fee structure prior to the issuance of the report from the commission Congress established to study this matter. In October 1996 Congress directed that a commission be formed to assess the FAA's funding needs and the costs imposed on the system by each segment of the aviation industry. This report was originally scheduled for completion in April 1997, but its issuance was delayed until September. It is incomprehensible to me that the conferees would agree to take the unusual step of changing the makeup of the ticket tax before the commission's report was received. 
Mr. President, this is one aspect of this budget agreement that I hope we will revisit once the commission's report is received and can be reviewed. 
I also oppose the agreement's provision extending the diesel dyeing requirements to kerosene. Since 1995, there has been substantial debate about the proper tax treatment for kerosene. More than 90 percent of kerosene consumed in the United States is used for aviation purpose; accordingly, the fuel is currently classified and taxed as an aviation fuel. 
Kerosene is also blended during cold weather with diesel fuel and home heating oil to prevent those fuels from congealing; and it is treated, for tax purposes, as the fuel into which it is blended. Thus, if kerosene is blended with undyed diesel fuel, it is taxed as diesel fuel; if it is blended with dyed home heating oil, it is exempt from tax. 
This bill imposes a 24.3 cents-per-gallon excise tax on kerosene when it is removed from the terminal, classifying it as diesel and subjecting it to the same tax and dye program. 
Because tankage in the Northeast is limited, terminals are likely to have space only for undyed kerosene. Such fuel is subject to tax when it is pulled from the rack; and, dealers who sell it directly as a heating fuel or as a blandstock for distillate, and farmers blending it as an off-highway fuel will be forced to apply for refunds of taxes paid. 
This proposal also raises safety concerns. The New England Association of Fire Marshals and the Consumer Product Safety Commission have raised health and safety concerns about the use of dyed fuels in unvented heaters. Most kerosene heaters have been certified by the United Laboratories and similar organizations as safe only if they burn clear, undyed fuel. Accordingly, there is little information available about the effects of dyed fuel on these heaters, and it would take several years to have them retested and recertified to burn dyed fuel. 
In closing, I would like to express my appreciation and admiration to the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, who did a wonderful job of guiding this legislation to this point. Without his willingness to work with all members of the committee, and indeed the entire Senate, this bill would have had little chance of success.

Mr. CHAFEE. Unfortunately, I understand the conference agreement on H.R. 2014 takes no action to equalize the rate of deficit reduction fuel taxes paid by the various modes of transportation. As the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee and I have discussed, an obvious inequity currently exists which requires that railroads pay a 5.55 cents-per-gallon fuel excise tax, while all other modes of transportation pay no more than 4.3 cents-per-gallon for this purpose. In fact, by transferring deficit reduction taxes paid by other transportation users, including truckers which compete with the railroads, into trust funds for infrastructure improvements, we exacerbate the current inequity. Railroads continue to contribute to deficit reduction, while their competitors instead contribute to their own infrastructure. 
If transportation is to be singled out for deficit reduction, the burden of contributing to a balanced budget should be shared equally among all modes. While I regret that no solution to this problem was possible in this legislation, I hope you share my belief that the fuel tax inequity imposed on the Nation's railroads must be remedied at the earliest opportunity.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate is considering S. 797, the John F. Kennedy Center Parking Improvement Act. This legislation, which will help to address parking and security problems at the Kennedy Center, was approved unanimously by the Committee On Environment and Public Works on June 5 of this year. I want to recognize the bill's cosponsors, Senators Lott, Baucus, Stevens, and Kennedy, for their valuable assistance. 
Briefly, Mr. President, this legislation provides authority to the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees to construct an addition to the existing parking garage at each of the north and south ends of the Center. Importantly, the Congressional Budget Office, in their letter of June 11, 1997, wrote that there will be not Federal costs associated with the enactment of S. 797. 
The garage project will be financed through the issuance of industrial revenue bonds which will be repaid entirely with revenue derived from operation of the expanded garage. The bill includes a provision explicitly prohibiting the use of appropriated funds for the purpose of constructing or financing the parking garage expansion. 
Also included in the bill is authorization for the Center to take action on site modifications for the improvement of security on the site. The Center has conducted a complete security review, and among the recommendations are changes to the main approach and plaza. This legislation allows the Center to pursue site modifications for the protection of the building and its visitors. The authorization of appropriations for this work, the site improvements and modifications, is provided by existing law. 
Consistent with the John F. Kennedy Center Act Amendments of 1994, the Center's plans for the garage expansion and other, related site improvements will be developed in close consultation with the Department of the Interior. 
Mr. President, the legislation reflects the commitment of the Kennedy Center Trustees to continually improve this Presidential monument for the benefit of the public--in a manner that is financially responsible. I want to again thank Senators Lott, Baucus, Stevens, and Kennedy, for their help in drafting this bill. I urge the Senate to adopt this legislation.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today considering legislation to assist in the relocation and expansion of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology at Brown University in Providence, RI. 
In 1955, the family of Rudolf F. Haffenreffer bequeathed to Brown University the museum he had founded in Bristol, RI. The museum includes more than 100,000 objects from native peoples of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. 
This is a teaching museum owned and supported by Brown University. It has a number of world-class holdings that attract scholars from all over the globe, and has been described by the American Association of Museums as a `superb medium- to small-sized facility with outstanding collections, excellent exhibits, and a superb program of public education and outreach.' 
While maintaining objects from around the world, the Haffenreffer Museum exhibits extensive archaeological materials from New England that are used to interpret prehistoric and historical cultural developments in Rhode Island and surrounding States. This legislation authorizes $3 million to preserve these culturally important collections and to provide expanded exhibition space that will make them more accessible to schoolchildren, scholars, students, and other visitors. 
In 1995, Brown University acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation [RTC] the historic Old Stone Bank building, built in 1854, along with the 1928 Federal-style residence known as the Benoni-Cooke House, both located in downtown Providence. The RTC took over both properties when the Old Stone Bank failed in 1993. 
Prior to Brown's purchase of these sites, it was unclear how or whether they would be put to use. The funds authorized by this bill will contribute a modest portion of the estimated $15 million Brown University will spend to relocate the Haffenreffer Museum from Bristol, RI, to the bank building and the Benoni-Cooke House, both of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
Mr. President, this is indeed a win-win project being carried out by Brown University. We will renovate, preserve and make fine use of two historic architectural landmarks--while providing greater access to an extraordinary tool for cultural and historical education. This is a fine example of the type of assistance our Federal Government can provide to local communities to preserve and make available for future generations the significant developments of our past. 
Mr. President, I encourage the support of colleagues.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about the nomination of Jamie Rappaport Clark to be Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The President nominated Ms. Clark on July 9, and I am pleased to report that last Thursday, July 24, the Committee on Environment and Public Works reported out the nomination. 
Jamie Clark is an outstanding candidate for the tasks at hand. She has worked closely with the Environment Committee staff and Committee members' staff on the Endangered Species Act and other tough issues. I have heard nothing but glowing reports of her ability to work with the Administration and Congress, which will serve her well, if confirmed. Throughout her educational and professional experiences, she has been involved on a daily basis with the principles of fish and wildlife management. Jamie Clark has worked with the Fish and Wildlife Service for over 8 years, both at the regional level and at headquarters. For the past 4 years of her tenure with the Service, she has held the position of Associate Director of Ecological Services. 
Prior to joining the Fish and Wildlife Service, Jamie Clark was the lead technical authority for fish and wildlife management on U.S. Army installations worldwide. From 1984 until 1988, she managed the Natural and Cultural Resources program within the National Guard. She also was a research biologist for the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute and worked for the National Institute for Urban Wildlife as a wildlife biologist. 
Jamie Clark's educational background is equally impressive and suits her well to the position of Fish and Wildlife Service Director. She holds a master's degree (MS) in Wildlife Ecology from the University of Maryland and a bachelor's degree (BS) in Wildlife Biology. 
If confirmed, Jamie Clark will be responsible for developing and carrying out policies to conserve, protect, and enhance the Nation's fish and wildlife and their habitats. A number of challenging tasks fall on the shoulders of the Fish and Wildlife Service Director, including the management of the National Wildlife Refuge System; the implementation of the Endangered Species Act; fish hatchery management; recreational fishing programs; management of non-indigenous and exotic species; conservation and management of migratory waterfowl and wild birds; and the list of responsibilities goes on. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service is an agency with the wonderful but difficult task of serving as an advocate for fish and wildlife. It must protect these public resources in the face of much criticism and question. The Service is charged with fulfilling its own mission in light of competing and sometimes conflicting mandates. It also must address the contentious issues of private property rights, water rights, and takings. The Service has done a remarkable job in recent years of developing initiatives that deal with many of these issues. The internal guidance documents for permits; the new safe harbor, candidate conservation and `no-surprises' policies; the policy for Native American rights; and the streamlining initiatives for federal agencies have all led to better implementation of the Endangered Species Act, better public relations, and ultimately better protection for the species. 
I am confident that Jamie Clark has the experience, insight, and the strength to lead the Fish and Wildlife Service to continue these initiatives and develop new ones through the challenges ahead. Thank you.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to offer my congratulations to the leaders on both sides of the aisle, the chairmen and ranking minority members of the Finance and Budget Committees, for all of their hard work in consummating this very significant, bipartisan budget agreement. While this bill is not everything I had hoped for, it is an important step toward getting our fiscal house in order. 
Moreover, it is grounded in a philosophy that I strongly believe in--that bipartisanship is the key to making government work. On difficult national problems, such as balancing the budget, neither party alone can get the job done, nor garner the public consensus needed for such action. 
Indeed, this was the genesis behind establishing the so-called Chafee-Breaux centrist budget coalition, which I believe deserves considerable credit for advancing the terms of debate on the issue of long-term Medicare reform. Regrettably means-testing of the part B premium, increasing the age of eligibility from 65 to 67, and the $5 home health copayment were dropped from the final package. However, the credit for getting them into the Senate version of this bill belongs to the centrist budget coalition. Each of these provisions was added to the Senate bill with a big, courageous bipartisan vote--something which would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. 
As a result of these pioneering Senate votes and the growing national consensus on the need for long-term reform, President Clinton has now pledged to stand with those Members of Congress who vote for means-testing of the part B premium, an important step toward creating the political environment which will be needed to secure this program for future generations of retirees. 
I would further urge the President, as well as Democratic party leaders, to disavow and distance themselves from candidates who resort to mediscare demagoguery in their future political campaigns. The American people deserve a responsible debate on this difficult subject, and the centrist coalition will be working to see that this happens. 
This bill does include a number of helpful changes for Medicare beneficiaries, low-income children, and legal immigrants which I would like to briefly highlight. 
Medigap provisions included in this bill, which I was pleased to author earlier this year, will do for Medicare beneficiaries much of what the Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance bill did for working Americans: It vastly improves portability and bans preexisting condition limitations for Medigap policy holders. 
This bill also improves access to emergency services for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans, which is derived from legislation Senator Graham authored and I was glad to cosponsor earlier this year. This provision establishes a prudent layperson definition of emergency medical conditions to ensure that emergency services are properly covered. 
This legislation also includes expanded preventive health care benefits for Medicare enrollees, including mammography, colorectal and prostate cancer screening; testing for osteoporosis; and improved coverage for diabetes and other important prevention measures. These enhanced services will be helpful to the more than 174,000 Medicare beneficiaries in Rhode Island. 
One of my most important priorities, that of expanding access to health insurance for low-income children, is also addressed in this bill. I am especially pleased that we are providing $24 billion for this purpose. This is a critical step forward for Rhode Island's children, 19 percent of whom live in poverty. Many of these poor children--38 percent--live in families where at least one parent is working, yet they are still poor. These funds are targeted to help these families especially. 
While I would have preferred greater specificity in terms of the benefits to be provided to children under this program, the final package is a significant improvement over some of the earlier proposals. I want to thank and acknowledge Senator Rockefeller for his leadership and expertise in working to advance the cause for children's health insurance. He was a strong partner in helping to make this a stronger and better program than it otherwise would have been. 
I also want to thank Senator Roth for helping me to ensure that Rhode Island can take full advantage of the funding provided under this program to continue its children's health initiatives. The Finance Committee chairman was very responsive to the problems this legislation posed for States, like Rhode Island, that have already expanded coverage. We were able to work together to ensure that Rhode Island will not be penalized for choosing to expand coverage on its own. 
This bill also gives States critical new flexibility by allowing them to enroll Medicaid beneficiaries into managed care without obtaining a waiver from the Department of Health and Human Services. At the same time, the legislation includes important safeguards for these beneficiaries, many of which were contained in legislation I introduced earlier this year. For example, disabled children, children in foster care and special needs children who have been adopted are protected from mandatory enrollment in managed care. Women enrolled in Medicaid managed care programs will continue to have the freedom to choose their family planning provider, even if that provider is not part of their managed care plan. 
This bill also restores Medicaid coverage to thousands of children who were removed from the SSI rolls as a result of eligibility changes made in the 1996 welfare reform law. This will be enormously helpful to many low-income families whose children may no longer be considered statutorily disabled but who nevertheless have significant special health care needs. 
Let me take a moment to describe the provisions of this bill dealing with legal immigrants. As my colleagues know, the 1996 welfare reform law placed severe restrictions on the Federal benefits that legal immigrants may receive. Among these restrictions was a complete and immediate cut-off of supplemental security income [SSI] and food stamp benefits, not only for future immigrants but for those already in this country legally. 
For the elderly and disabled legal immigrants who last August were in the United States--including nearly 4,000 in my own State of Rhode Island--the new SSI ban represented nothing short of a crisis. For many, the loss of this critical Federal aid would mean losing the ability to live independently. In turn, this would present a serious community and fiscal challenge to State and local governments, as immigrants who had lost benefits and faced destitution turned to nursing homes or other costly facilities for support. 
I was sorely troubled by these restrictions on immigrants, and pledged to do what I could to mitigate the most harsh of these during this Congress. I am delighted to say that in this regard, we have been successful. The conference report before us now is identical to the Senate-passed bill on which I and others of my colleagues worked very hard. 
It restores benefits to those legal immigrants who were receiving SSI as of last August. It also allows immigrants who were in the United States last August and who may become disabled in the future to receive SSI. For my State, this means that 3,753 currently elderly and disabled Rhode Island residents--and many others who may become disabled in the future--will be able to receive basic SSI assistance to allow them to live with dignity. 
Now, the immigrant provisions of this bill are not perfect. And I am disappointed that it does not contain the Chafee-Graham amendment on legal immigrant children and Medicaid, or the provision dealing with SSI for those too disabled to naturalize. But the bill before us goes a long way toward restoring fair treatment for the thousands of legal, tax-paying immigrants who were in the country and playing by the rules when welfare reform was enacted. 
I want to commend Senators D'Amato, Feinstein, DeWine, and Graham for all of their hard work in helping to solve this problem. Since the introduction of our Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act in April, we have been working as a united team toward fair treatment for legal immigrants. With passage of this bill, our efforts will have met with success. 
In closing, I am hopeful that we can build upon the bipartisanship that was necessary to make this bill a reality when we turn to the more challenging task of advancing long-term budget and entitlement reforms in the future. 
I particularly want to address the entitlement reforms I strongly believe are necessary for Medicare. Although the provisions we worked hard on--means testing the part B premium, increasing the age of eligibility from 65 to 67, the $5 home health care copayment--were dropped in the final package, nonetheless, I think it behooves all of us to continue our work on each of these measures, and certainly I will do everything I can to advance them. I thank the Chair.  
Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I commend the efforts of the Senator from Alaska Senator Stevens, and the Senator from Maine Senator Snowe, for bringing this much-needed legislation to the floor. It has been nearly 2 years since legislation was first introduced in the Senate to implement the Panama Declaration, an international agreement which will promote marine conservation in the Pacific Ocean. I recognize that the opponents of this measure have strong convictions, and am pleased that the two sides were able to work out a compromise that, most importantly, is consistent with the international agreement which the United States signed. 
Let me first state my view that eliminating dolphin mortality must remain a top priority as the Senate considers this bill. Like so many Americans, I will not soon forget the tragedy that occurred in the 1970's, when hundreds of thousands of dolphins were killed annually from tuna fishing in the Eastern Tropical Pacific [ETP]. In 1972 alone, more than 420,000 dolphins were killed there. While we can all applaud the tremendous progress that has been made in reducing dolphin mortality in recent years, Congress must be vigilant in working toward complete elimination. 
But dolphins are not the only species adversely impacted by tuna fishing in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, sometimes called ETP. New fishing methods have resulted in significant bycatch of nondolphin species, including juvenile tuna. These other marine species in this ecosystem must also be protected, and legislation should address this larger goal. 
The question before the Senate today is how do we best achieve sustained conservation in the ETP tuna fishery? We must first acknowledge that much progress has been made in reducing dolphin mortality through new fishing techniques such as the back down procedure. Through this technique, the back edge of the purse seine fishing net sinks below the surface, allowing dolphins to swim out. In 1996, dolphin mortality in the ETP is currently estimated at a record low of less than 3,000, down from record highs of more than 400,000 in the 1970's. That's a 99-percent reduction. 
International cooperation in conserving this resource, particularly through the voluntary measures of the La Jolla agreement of 1992, has also been a primary factor in achieving this great success. Among other things, this landmark agreement, which was signed by 10 nations, established strict dolphin mortality limits and required observers to be present aboard tuna fishing boats in the ETP. 
In order to continue this tremendous progress, the United States must continue to work with our neighbors on multilateral efforts to conserve this resource. This involves enacting the legislation before the Senate today, S. 39, which implements the Panama Declaration. 
Contrary to much of what has been said in the 2 years since it was signed, the Panama Declaration represents the best in international conservation. It would retain--and in many cases, enhance--the provisions of the La Jolla agreement that have been so successful in reducing dolphin mortality and protecting the tuna fishery. Let me be clear: the Panama Declaration will not threaten the dolphin population in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. 
Unlike the voluntary La Jolla Agreement, the Panama Declaration is binding upon its signatories. Among its many stringent requirements are reductions in the annual overall limit on dolphin mortalities that were established by the La Jolla agreement. These limits include per-stock mortality limits to protect all dolphin populations. 
The Panama Declaration also increases enforcement and monitoring efforts to protect dolphins, including mandatory observers on all tuna fishing vessels. In addition, it sets as an agreed goal the elimination of all dolphin mortality in the ETP tuna fishery. And the Panama Declaration has teeth: if foreign nations do not comply, then the United States can reimpose our tuna embargo. 
Opponents of S. 39 have been concerned over its change in the definition of dolphin safe, as mandated by the Panama Declaration. It is important to note that the new definition of dolphin safe is not weaker than current law. Let me explain. 
When the current definition was adopted in 1990, the dolphin safe label was intended to prevent the import of tuna into the United States that were caught by encircling dolphins. This definition made good sense in 1990 since, historically, fishing methods that encircled dolphins caused high mortality rates. But as I've stated, recent modifications to the encirclement method of tuna fishing have resulted in reduced dolphin mortality. 
A more sensible definition of dolphin safe should mean no dolphins were killed during the tuna fishing, rather than no dolphins were encircled. Under the new definition, if even one dolphin is killed in the process, that tuna cannot be labeled dolphin safe. Proponents of the old definition want truth in labeling. I agree with this. But, don't consumers expect that dolphin safe means no dolphins were killed? The Panama Declaration and S. 39 would do just that. 
In any event, so as to be absolutely sure that these new encirclement techniques do not adversely affect dolphin stocks in the ETP, the compromise before us today delays the label change until NOAA conducts a preliminary survey of these stocks. This slight delay should not threaten United States participation in the Panama Declaration, allowing its strong conservation requirements to be implemented. 
The Panama Declaration also recognizes the importance of protecting nondolphin marine life in the ETP that has been harmed by tuna fishing. The controversy over dolphin mortality has encouraged tuna fishermen to utilize alternative methods to encirclement--namely school sets and log sets. These techniques, while more protective of dolphins, are well known to cause destruction of nondolphin marine life, including sea turtles, billfish, sharks, and juvenile yellowfin tuna. 
NOAA scientists have warned repeatedly that the high bycatch of juvenile tuna, associated with these two fishing methods, might actually imperial tuna stocks in the future--to say nothing of their impact on other species. As envisioned by the Panama Declaration, S. 39 requires the United States to implement a program to reduce bycatch of all marine life in the ETP, not just dolphins. 
Mr. President, today the United States confronts a choice that must be made soon on how best to conserve marine life in the Pacific Ocean. Negotiators have worked out a compromise that will allow the United States to choose the best option. This option entails joining our neighbors in implementing a binding, carefully crafted international agreement that includes strong mandates that will protect dolphins and other species. 
Another option involved going it alone, sacrificing what little leverage we have in an increasingly foreign fishery. Keep in mind that the ETP is completely outside the jurisdiction of the United States. We cannot simply go in and tell others how to fish. 
Instead, our best chance of promoting conservation is through a multilateral, rather than a unilateral, forum. But other signatories to the Panama Declaration will not wait forever while the United States Congress continues to debate this issue. The time to act is now. 
If we had chosen to go it alone, dolphins would not necessarily have been saved. Indeed, more dolphins may well be killed if the United States rejects the Panama Declaration, as fishermen will likely abandon the voluntary provisions of the La Jolla agreement. What incentive would these fishermen have to conserve if the largest consumer of tuna maintains an embargo on their product and refuses to participate in international conservation efforts? 
Because the Panama Declaration offers the best hope for marine conservation in the ETP, S. 39 has been endorsed by Greenpeace, National Wildlife Federation, Center for Marine Conservation, Environmental Defense Fund, and World Wildlife Fund. These groups recognize the merits of this multilateral approach. 
I again commend the tireless efforts of the authors of this legislation, and urge my colleagues to support S. 39.

<TEXT>
Mr. CHAFEE. I want to start off, Mr. President, by saying to Senator Shelby that I am very pleased that this legislation has come to the Senate floor. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly discuss a project of great importance to my home State of Rhode Island. 
Included within S. 1048 is $10 million for the Rhode Island freight rail development project commonly known as the Third Track. I would like to express my gratitude to the subcommittee chairman, the manager of the bill, Senator Shelby, who has agreed to include this funding in his subcommittee's bill. And I see the distinguished ranking member of the committee, and I would also like to express my thanks to him likewise for support of this legislation. 
Earlier this year Senator Shelby was kind enough to take time to listen to Rhode Island's Governor, Lincoln Almond, Senator Reed from Rhode Island, and myself as we outlined the benefits of the Third Track project. And, Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to say that Senator Reed has been very interested and very supportive of all efforts in connection with this Third Track. 
The Third Track is a $120 million project that will upgrade 22 miles of rail line between Quonset Point-Davisville, and Central Falls, RI. It is needed to accommodate two impending changes that are occurring on this rail line: First, the increased passenger rail traffic and more passenger trains that will result from Amtrak's New Haven-Boston electrification project--that is the first problem that has arisen--and, secondly, the larger freight cars that will operate along the line. 
The Third Track represents a tremendous potential for economic growth and job creation in Rhode Island. It plays a vital role in the State's development of the Quonset-Davisville Industrial Park and making that into a premier commerce park and international cargo point. 
Mr. President, let us take a brief look at recent developments associated with this Third Track. In just the past year, some 19 new tenants and four others have expanded their operations and have invested over $16 million and brought 500 new jobs to the Quonset-Davisville Industrial Park. 
It is conservatively estimated that development of the port and of the park will yield in excess of 15,000 good-paying jobs to Rhode Island. The Third Track is a key element in what is not surprisingly one of our State's most promising economic development projects. 
To date, Congress has appropriated $13 million for the Third Track. Another $42 million is budgeted over the next 4 years, including the $10 million within the bill before the Senate today. 
Rhode Island's voters, on their part, in order to fulfill the State's 50-50 funding matching requirement, passed a bond referendum last November allocating $50 million to this Third Track. I might say, Mr. President, a $50 million bond issue is a substantial one for our small State of little fewer than a million people. 
The Third Track represents great hope for economic growth in Rhode Island at a time when our manufacturing job base continues to erode. 
I again thank Chairman Shelby for his support and also thank the distinguished ranking member of the committee, Senator Lautenberg, for his support, and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. 
Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Again, I do want to thank the two distinguished managers of the legislation, the bill. The chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Shelby, has been very, very helpful, and as I indicated, very responsive. And we are very appreciative. And likewise, Senator Lautenberg, as mentioned, we have--I have to be careful in my use of words. I was going to say `pestered' him, but we have implored him or spent a good deal of time pointing out the virtues of this project. And the way they both have responded makes us very grateful. 
And I say to Senator Shelby, I want to thank you for your kind remarks and the work you have done on this, and Senator Lautenberg likewise.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, earlier this week I met with Senator Byrd to discuss S. Res. 98, which, of course, deals with climate change. In this measure, the Senator has identified one of the more important features required to address this global problem, namely, global participation. 
Gradually, many have come to the conclusion that man is indeed contributing to changes in the global climate. Human activities--particularly the burning of fossil fuels--have increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other trace greenhouse gases. These gases, combined with the natural levels of CO2 and water vapor, act like panes of a greenhouse and retain the Sun's heat around the earth. 
The burning of fossil fuels has continued to grow, at least in ever greater amounts of CO2. Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels reached a record of just over 6 billion tons in 1995. 
The Earth's climate has remained stable for the past 10,000 years. But, as Ambassador Paul Nitze said in the Washington Post earlier this month, `Global warming threatens the stability that fostered modern civilization.' 
What is being done about this threat? Of the 35 industrial countries that committed themselves under the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change in Rio, they agreed there to hold their greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels in the year 2000. In other words, by the year 2000 we would get the levels down to what they were in 1990. 
But, regrettably, Mr. President, only a handful of the countries are expected to meet that target. The United States will miss its target by an estimated 13 percent. In some developing countries, emissions are on a course to nearly double between 1990 and 2000. 
The failure by many industrialized countries to meet these voluntary aims is what is leading us to this debate today. This debate is over the imposition of legally binding greenhouse gas emissions reductions. In other words, should we enter something that is binding? 
Because of the link between greenhouse gases and activities fundamental to industrialized and developing economies, many anticipate, or at least fear, that the costs of limiting their emissions will be high. 
Unlike most other ambient air and water pollution problems, there is no pollution control technology for CO2. In many of the emissions problems we have dealt with in the past, technology can reduce the amount of emissions. But we don't have that for CO2. You either make CO2 or you don't. 
Some have argued that the United States and, indeed the entire world, should wait to address the looming threat of climate change. In other words, don't do anything. Let's wait awhile. The scientists are divided on this. How much has the temperature gone up? Has it indeed risen in the last 100 years by 1 degree Fahrenheit? There are arguments over that. `Time is on our side,' some say, believing that if we simply wait long enough, new and inexpensive technologies will come along to make this solution painless. 
But the citizens of my State, for example, have concerns. We are a sea-bordering State. There are possibilities of rises in the sea level which would affect us dramatically. Indeed, they would affect all but one major city in our country because all but one major city in our country occupies tidal shorelines. I know that if the Atlantic Ocean begins to warm and expands as it warms, rising sea levels will be with us for centuries. 
I am also concerned about the economic consequences of actions to address global warming. Senator Byrd has addressed these, and I salute him for that. He is concerned about the issue of U.S. competitiveness in relation to developing countries. And I join with him in urging our negotiators to recognize that we are serious about the concerns Senator Byrd is expressing. 
The position taken by the European Union is a major concern. As representatives of the Global Climate Coalition indicated to the Foreign Relations Committee last month, the prospect of European Union bubble, which was just addressed here, with no ability for the United States to address similar alliances with other nations, would permit the European Union to steal a competitive march on the United States. 
This concerns me. In trade terms, our bilateral trade with the European Union, of course, is mammoth certainly when compared to the trade that we have with China. Last year we had $128 billion in exports to the European Union, more than 10 times of that going to China. 
I believe our negotiators in Kyoto would fail us if they did not bring home an agreement with developing country commitments as described in the resolution and with the market-based tools of joint implementation emissions trading and emissions banking. 
I want to say that many countries in the U.S. are already taking steps to address these problems. Farsighted companies 
like Tucson Electric are going ahead with a pilot joint implementation project in cooperation with the city of Sava in Honduras to display diesel-fired power generation with biomass fuels. Companies like American Electric Power, which is the largest electric utility in West Virginia, and British Petroleum are getting together with the Nature Conservancy and the Government of Bolivia to offset some of American Electric Power's coal-fired plant emissions by expanding parks and sustainable forests in Bolivia. 
The Southern Co. has joined forces with State forestry commissions in planting 20 million trees in Georgia, Alabama, and the Florida Panhandle. These projects boost environmental protection while lowering costs. But on their own, the voluntary projects will not be sufficient to address the potential problem. We need legally binding measures to spur technological innovation that will be needed to solve the greenhouse problem. 
The resolution makes clear that an exemption for developing countries would be inconsistent with the need for global action. 
In light of the seriousness of the issue, Mr. President, I welcome the concern that Senator Byrd and others have shown for the twin goals of environmental protection and economic competitiveness.

With regard to specific provisions contained in the resolution, I am interested in what the Senators intend on page 4, lines 9 through 11 by the phrase `new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for developing country parties.' 
Is it the Senators' intentions that the developing country parties, irrespective of the national incomes and greenhouse gas emission rates, be mandated to the very same commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the annex 1 parties?

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss one provision in the legislation now before the Senate. Under the heading of Related Agencies, the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill provides funding for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. 
As my colleagues know, our Nation's Special Trade Representative, backed by the team of staff at USTR, is responsible for negotiating and administering trade agreements and coordinating overall trade policy for the United States. Those are significant responsibilities, and they are critical to the economic interests of American firms, workers, consumers, and families. 
For an agency with such significant duties, USTR does not consume much in the way of taxpayer monies. Annual funding for USTR has hovered at just over $20 million for the past 5 years. In terms of the Federal budget--or for that matter of the several other agencies funded by this bill--$20 million is a mere pittance. 
I might say that for what we get in return, the funds spent on USTR represent quite a bargain. Thanks to USTR, we have in place trade agreements and policies that allow our companies to compete successfully worldwide. And where barriers remain, the USTR team works continuously to make further progress. Their work over the years has affected billions of dollars in U.S. trade and contributes enormously to the health of the overall U.S. economy. 
Now, USTR does not require much in funding because for the most part, appropriations are spent on two items: salaries and travel. Those basic necessities--the salaries that pay the staff, and the travel that is required for the various ongoing negotiations with our trading partners around the world--make up the bulk of USTR's financial needs. There is not much fat there. Therefore, every dime they get is critical. 
I want to commend the chairman of the Commerce-State-Justice Subcommittee for allocating the full budget request for USTR for fiscal year 1998. Under his bill, the Office of the USTR will receive $22,092,000, exactly what the administration sought. I want to thank him for that. 
Let me raise one concern, however, that I know is shared by the 
leadership and most members of the Senate Finance Committee. Since the January 1995 implementation of the Uruguay round agreements and the WTO, USTR has taken on an enormous new docket of cases in which the United States is involved, and all of these cases now come with strict deadlines. As of July 1, there were pending some 47 WTO or NAFTA cases in which the United States is a plaintiff, a defendant, or otherwise a participant. That is quite a workload. Yet despite the increase, USTR has not increased its career legal staff. The number of lawyers and litigators now on staff is virtually the same as in the pre-WTO days. USTR has just 12 lawyers in Washington, with 2 more in Geneva, and only 2 of them are able to devote themselves fulltime to the international litigation. That dearth of staff makes no sense--and only hurts our efforts to win our cases. 
I believe USTR must have the resources and personnel that it needs to fulfill its responsibilities. While I am delighted that USTR received its full budget request, I must say that the budget request amount is simply not realistic for an agency facing these new assignments. Even a modest increase of, say, $1 million--which again, in terms of the federal budget is not even visible--would make a significant and positive difference to the ability of USTR to carry out its work. And that in turn would only benefit US workers and families, and the overall US economy. 
I want to urge USTR to press the Office of Management and Budget to recognize their new workload. I have mentioned this repeatedly to Ambassador Barshefsky and I hope she will act on it. And I want to exhort OMB in the strongest terms possible to adjust next year's budget request accordingly for USTR. I am confident that such an adjustment would be met with favor by the members of the authorizing committee, namely the Senate Finance Committee. 
If OMB fails to act, then it may fall to Congress to do the right thing, and make the small but necessary increased investment in this agency. Indeed, I seriously considered taking such a step during today's debate. But for now I will wait. Thanks to the good work of the chairman, we do have in this bill $22 million in full funding for USTR, and I intend to do what I can to make sure that that full $22 million becomes law. However, I call upon the administration in no uncertain terms to ensure that in the budget submitted next year, USTR is provided the resources they need.

Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator. What I propose to do is give more SBDCs the tools they need to encourage small companies to start exporting. As the Senator knows, the SBDCs are doing a terrific job helping small business owners devise business plans, marketing strategies, and so forth, but many of them simply don't have the capacity to offer advice on how to export. 
We ought to try to change that, in my view. Exporting is the name of the game today--even for small businesses. And one way to do that would be to broaden access to a successful small business export promotion program called the International Trade Data Network, or ITDN. 
Now, what is the ITDN? The ITDN is a computer-based service that small business owners can use to retrieve a stunning amount of international trade data--compiled both from Federal Government sources and the private sector. With a few quick keystrokes, individuals can read about everything from market demographics to descriptions of upcoming trade missions to explanations of relevant export and import regulations to potential contract leads. Small businesses anxious to export can learn about virtually every industry and virtually every country. 
The ITDN was developed in 1988 by the Export Assistance Center at Bryant College in Smithfield, RI, and it's been a big help to literally hundreds of Rhode Island's small businesses. In fact, 18 companies in Rhode Island use the ITDN every single day. 
Listen to some of these endorsements from Rhode Island business owners. One said, `The information made available through the ITDN is an integral part of our Pre-Entry Level Market Analysis.' Another reported, `I find the ITDN to be a state-of-the-art, user friendly software that is a one-stop shop for international information. It is a vital tool for businesses today that need to survive in a global environment.' 
But right now, only 30 or so of our 960 Small Business Development Centers have direct access to the ITDN. So what I'd like to do is expand the program, so that SBDCs all across the country are connected to it. Specifically what I have in mind is converting the ITDN to an internet-based website, and establishing an Interactive Video Trade Conferencing Center at each State's lead small business assistance office. My proposal would also make the ITDN technology available to the Approximately 2,500 SBDC sub-centers across the country. 
As I understand the situation, SBDCs are already authorized to conduct export promotion activities under Section 21 of the Small Business Act. In fact, representatives of Bryant College met with the SBA's Associate Administrator for the SBDC program earlier this year to discuss this proposal, and received a very positive response. For one reason or another, however, the SBA has been reluctant to dedicate any money to this purpose. 
The 1988 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriation bill contains $75.8 million for the SBDC program, an increase of some $2.3 million over the 1997 funding level. In talking with the folks at the Export Assistance Center at Bryant College, it's my understanding that expanding the ITDN could be done over 2 years, with a first year cost of about $925,000. I'd ask the distinguished manager if I could get his endorsement of my proposal.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my hearty congratulations to Frank and Marion Hawkins on their 50th wedding anniversary. Frank and Marion took their vows at St. Raymond's Church in Providence, RI, in 1947. So, on October 2, they will have spent 50 years together, living their dreams, raising their family, and sharing their successes and setbacks. 
The Hawkins are blessed with four children: Robert, Charles, Mary-Ellen, and Stephen. They are also the proud grandparents of five grandchildren. 
After graduating from Providence College in 1942, Frank served in the Army Air Force during World War II. Marion graduated from Edgewood Secretarial School. Frank retired in 1986 after working for the Carey & Celotex Corp. 
I am pleased to announce that the family will gather on July 27, 1997, for a mass and festive meal to celebrate the Hawkins' 50th wedding anniversary. In closing, Mr. President, I want to extend my best wishes to the entire Hawkins family as they come together to celebrate this wonderful event.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Campbell for his work on this appropriations bill. I was particularly pleased with the funding level for the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, which was increased by $1 million over the budget request. It is my hope that, although not specifically earmarked, a portion of these funds will go toward completing the Rhode Island Historical Society's ongoing project `The Papers of General Nathaniel Greene.' 
As I am sure my colleagues are aware, Nathaniel Greene, in addition to being a famous Rhode Islander, was second in command to General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War. Nathaniel Greene's papers, which are extensive, provide a complete, first-person account of the Revolution. The Greene papers include numerous correspondence with George Washington, as well as letters from all of the members of the Continental Congress, the Board of War, many of the state governors, a number of Generals in the Continental Army, and other troops and their loved ones. 
When the war was over, General Greene, clearly recognizing the historical significance of his correspondence, gathered as many as 6,000 letters and documents in trunks and made his way home to Rhode Island. Later, he stopped in Princeton, New Jersey, the site of the Continental Congress, and expressed his desire to have his papers copied, assembled, and bound in books. That very day, Congress agreed to General Greene's request and voted to provide him with a clerk to undertake this task. Regrettably, General Greene died two years later, and, over the years, his papers have been scattered between more than 100 repositories in a number of states. 
Since 1971, the Rhode Island Historical Society has worked to assemble and publish the extraordinary papers of this remarkable patriot. At the onset of this project, which was cosponsored by The William L. Clement Library at the University of Michigan, funds were provided by the National Historical Publications Commission (now the NHPRC). Additional funds were received through the National Endowment for the Humanities, which contributed to the completion of the first nine volumes of `The Papers of General Nathaniel Greene.' 
The remaining volumes of the Greene Papers will focus on the Revolutionary War in the South. Details about the Southern Campaign are far less well known than those about the War in the North. 
At the age of thirty-two, Nathaniel Greene became the youngest General in the Continental Army and later became commander of the Southern Army. In 1781 and 1782, he and his troops defeated the British in the Carolinas and in Georgia. The several volumes that remain to be completed focus on this aspect of our nation's early history. It is a period that, in some important aspects, is not well chronicled, and I believe that completion of the Greene Papers will add significantly to our knowledge of an entire region--the South. 
Once again, I applaud Senators Campbell and Kohl for their work on this bill and hope that funds from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission will be available for completion of the Greene Papers.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that this bill has come to the Senate floor, and commend the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Vermont for all of their hard work in authoring this important legislation. S. 955 provides increased funding for international affairs functions of our Government, a priority that has been neglected in recent years. I agree with Secretary of State Madeline Albright, who has argued that we can no longer conduct foreign policy on the cheap. 
Section 571 of this bill is a briefly worded but very significant restriction on U.S. military assistance. Mr. President, Indonesia is an emerging power in South Asia that has a very considerable economic relationship with the United States. I have long believed that we should fully engage the developing world not only for our own economic interests, but also so that the citizens of these nations can enjoy economic prosperity. Such economic development is the best means of enhancing long-term peace and stability. 
Unfortunately, though, Indonesia has yet to join the community of nations in respecting basic human rights and permitting political freedom. Indonesia's continuing repression of East Timor has dampened hope that this nation's tremendous economic success will be matched by progress on human rights and democracy. In just the past month, international human rights activists have cited the disappearance and possible torture of a number of East Timorese civilians. This news comes as the State Department has sharply criticized Indonesia's human rights record in its annual report issued in January. 
These events are just the latest examples of the Indonesian Government's continuing denial of fundamental rights to the people of East Timor. This past May, Indonesia held an election which was widely discredited as undemocratic. This election, which returned the ruling party to power as has been done in every election since 1971, was marred by violence that killed 200 people. Clearly, Indonesia must end its behavior that has caused so much pain and suffering among its people. 
Mr. President, section 571 would simply prevent United States military equipment sold or transferred to Indonesia from being used in East Timor, the site of the most egregious human rights violations committed by this government. The United States should have no part of this oppression, particularly through the provision of military equipment. I commend the managers of this bill for including this important restriction, and am hopeful that it will be enacted into law.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senators Jeffords and Kennedy, in introducing legislation to reauthorize the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Later this month, we will vote on funding for the Endowments, and it is my sincere hope that the Senate will show its determination to continue Federal support for the arts, as it has in years past. 
Although other countries have long histories of government support for cultural activities, Federal support for artists in the United States began during the Great Depression, when the WPA hired scores of writers, musicians, painters, sculptors, and other artists to work on public art projects. But that support was short lived. It wasn't until 1964 that the National Endowment for the Arts first was created. The NEA saw profound growth during the Nixon and Ford administrations. 
Regrettably, its funding has been reduced by about 40 percent over the past few years primarily because of a few grants that were deemed to have been obscene and inappropriate. With regard to this issue of obscene art, I believe that any such debate should be framed in terms of the overall record of the NEA, not in terms of a few grants that may have escaped appropriate scrutiny. Of the more than 100,000 grants provided by the NEA in its almost 30-year history, only a handful have been the subject of controversy. That is an excellent track record, and I do not believe that those few grants should be used as the yardstick by which the Endowment is judged. 
Mr President, the public's support for the NEA and NEH is very strong. In Rhode Island, we have a vigorous and growing arts community. The Rhode Island School of Design is among the most prestigious fine arts and design schools in the Nation. It attracts the most talented students and teachers who often make Rhode Island their permanent home. Many Rhode Islanders, and people in the city of Providence in particular, are enormously enthusiastic about the arts community, which has contributed greatly to our economic redevelopment efforts. 
The NEA and NEH support a wide array of artists, writers, actors, musicians, and other artists. During the past several weeks, I have heard from a number of Rhode Island artists. I would like to share an excerpt from a Rhode Island musician with you. Rebecca Truitt, a cellist in the Rhode Island Philharmonic, wrote to me on March 8. This is what she said:  
The declining state of public support for the arts in America is of great concern to me. . . . Equally critical is the possibility that our cultural agencies may fail to receive authorization for Fiscal Year 1998. Should that happen, it would be an embarrassing day for the United States, making us unique among cultured nations by eliminating the arts from our priorities. Whether all orchestras, including my orchestra, the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra, receive funding or not, one thing is clear, the NEA has helped raise the standard of all professional performing groups in the U.S., catapulting American music and musicians to the forefront of the international music scene. Moreover, the NEA has helped to promote and sustain American jobs. 
Throughout my years in the Senate, I have supported funding for both the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Once again, I am delighted to introduce this reauthorization bill with Senators Jeffords and Kennedy.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr President, in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I introduce today the Disaster Streamlining and Costs Reduction Act of 1997, on behalf of the administration. This bill amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act with the goal of reducing the costs of disaster relief and emergency assistance provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA]. 
This legislation was submitted to the Senate on June 30, 1997, by FEMA Director James L. Witt. Submission of the bill fulfills, albeit late, a directive included in the FY 1997 VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act. 
In that act, the distinguished Appropriations subcommittee chairman, Senator Bond, and his ranking member, Senator Mikulski, directed FEMA to propose methods of reducing the skyrocketing costs of Federal disaster relief aid. I commend Senators Bond, Mikulski and other Appropriations Committee members for their initiative. 
As my colleagues are well aware, the Stafford Act is designed to provide an orderly and continuing means of assistance by the Federal Government to State and local governments in carrying out their responsibilities to alleviate the suffering and damage which result from disasters. In recent years, this assistance has grown increasingly expensive and has resulted in the reduction of annual funding levels for other Government programs which must compete directly with it. 
I believe that the cause for the dramatic increase in disaster spending is at least two-fold. First, we are witnessing a period when more and more of our population is being affected by natural and man-made disasters. This might be due to what some say is an increase in the frequency of violent storms--coupled with the fact that a growing proportion of our citizens reside in coastal and riverine regions, causing them to be more vulnerable to floods. 
Second, it is apparent that implementation of the Stafford Act could be conducted in a more fiscally sound manner. Are too many facilities or entities eligible for Federal disaster assistance? Is there mismanagement of grant moneys? Is there too much red tape at FEMA? These are the questions that have been asked. 
This legislation purports to address both of these broad items believed by many to have contributed to increased disaster spending. To lessen risk to populations and structures, the administration's bill establishes new hazard mitigation authorities. The bill also reduces the number of public and private nonprofit facilities eligible for aid. Finally, the bill includes various management reforms to streamline the delivery of emergency assistance. 
I have given this legislation a preliminary review and find that much in it makes a great deal of sense. Other elements may be problematic. But this is just the first step. This proposal will receive careful scrutiny in the Committee on Environment and Public Works and most likely will be modified several times after we have had a chance to receive input from the States and from disaster relief experts from across the country. 
This is a serious issue involving the lives and property of millions of Americans. It also involves billions of taxpayer dollars. While the Congress must address these FEMA cost issues swiftly, we must also preserve the central mission of the Stafford Act. Toward that end, I look forward to conducting hearings on this bill in the Committee on Environment and Public Works. 
With the help of Senator Bond, who is also a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Inhofe, who chairs the relevant subcommittee, and other members, I am confident that we will be able to produce effective reform legislation in timely fashion. I also look forward to working closely with Director Witt and the administration and commend them for their proposal.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Sikes Act was enacted by Congress in 1960 to provide enhanced stewardship of fish and wildlife and other natural resources on military installations. It was named for Congressman Bob Sikes of Florida. The act seeks to capitalize on the enormous potential for natural resource conservation on military lands. The Department of Defense controls nearly 25 million acres of land and water at approximately 900 military installations in the United States, and the National Guard oversees an additional 1 million acres on 80 sites. These lands serve as home to approximately 100 endangered or threatened species and countless other fish and wildlife resources. 
The Sikes Act was last amended in 1986, and authorization expired in 1993. Since then, several attempts to reauthorize the act have been made, and although Congress has been close several times, all have failed. We now have a golden opportunity to amend and reauthorize the Sikes Act, in S. 936, the bill to authorize the Department of Defense. 
Two weeks ago, an agreement was reached among the Department of Defense, the Department of the Interior, the International Association of State Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and the two House committees with jurisdiction over the Sikes Act. The White House approved the agreement the following day. The amendment that I am introducing, together with Senator Baucus and Senator Kempthorne, is virtually identical to the House version, which passed in the House as part of H.R. 1119, the Department of Defense authorization bill. This amendment to the Sikes Act will greatly improve the current law. 
In its current form, the Sikes Act authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into cooperative plans with the Secretary of the Interior and the appropriate State fish and wildlife agency for the conservation of fish and wildlife on military lands. Over the 37 years of the Sikes Act, cooperation under the act has improved fish and wildlife management on military bases. 
For example, wetlands associated with the North American Waterfowl Management Plan that are on military bases have been restored under a recent initiative by the Fish and Wildlife Service and Department of Defense. Fort Bragg and Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and Elgin Air Force base in Florida, have undertaken efforts to protect the redcockaded woodpecker. Fisheries assessments are taking place on both coasts, including Brunswick Naval air station in Maine and a submarine base in Washington. 
While these examples illustrate how cooperation can improve natural resource management, more can and should be done. Only 250 agreements exist, and many of these are outdated. In addition, many agreements provide only for minimal cooperation among parties, rather than affirmative management of the resources. Another 200 agreements are currently being developed. 
The amendment that Senator Baucus, Senator Kempthorne, and I are introducing would infuse new vigor into implementation of the Sikes Act. Specifically, it would require the Secretary of each military department to develop a natural resource management plan for each of its military installations, unless there is an absence of significant natural resources on the base. The plan would be prepared by the Secretary in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service and the appropriate State fish and wildlife agency. The plan must be consistent with the use of military lands to ensure the preparedness of the military, and cannot result in any net loss in the capability of the military installation to support the military mission of the installation. With those caveats, the plan must also provide for the management and conservation of natural resources. This language accommodates the interests of the State and Federal wildlife agencies as well as the needs of the military. 
While the agreement was negotiated on the House side, I would like to make several observations regarding the differences between the current law and this agreement. The most important change in the law, of course, is that development of the natural resources management plans would become mandatory. In practical terms however, this provision would better conform to and encourage the current practice of the military, which already has a policy of developing these plans. 
An equally important change to the law would be that preparation and implementation of the plans would be the responsibility of the Secretary of the 
appropriate military department, rather than the Secretary of Defense. Extensive discussions last year revolved around attempts to agree on a dispute resolution process in the event that the Department of Defense, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the State fish and wildlife agency could not agree on the development of a particular plan. The balance struck in the current agreement between the requirement to prepare the plans, and the discretion afforded the Secretary of the individual military department regarding the content of each plan, seems to me to be a good one. 
Greater specificity would be provided for the contents of the plans, which are to provide for, among other things and to the extent appropriate, fish and wildlife management and habitat enhancement, establishment of management goals and objectives, and sustainable use by the public. 
The amendment also provides for an opportunity for the public to comment on individual plans, as well as a review of each military installation by the Secretary of the appropriate military department to determine whether new plans should be prepared or existing plans should be modified. In addition, the amendment would also require annual reports by the Secretaries of Defense and the Interior regarding funding for implementation of the Sikes Act. The Department of Defense currently spends approximately $5 million for developing plans under the Sikes Act, but there are few cost estimates for State fish and wildlife agencies, as well as for the Fish and Wildlife Service. Thus, these annual reports should provide valuable information. 
The amendment also seeks to encourage cooperative agreements for the funding of management and conservation measures without specifying particular cost sharing or matching requirements. 
I would note that there is one substantive change between the House language and this amendment. This change was negotiated between the Committees on Environment and Public Works and Armed Services, and approved by all interested parties, including the Departments of Defense and the Interior, and the International Association of State Fish and Wildlife Agencies. Specifically, the deadline for completing the natural resource management plans is extended from 2 to 3 years from the date of the initial report to Congress, which itself is required 1 year from the date of enactment. This change should enable the Department of Defense to complete the plans consistent with its own internal time frames, without unnecessarily missing any statutory deadlines. 
I would note that jurisdiction of the Sikes Act, since its passage in 1960, has always rested with the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Bills to amend and reauthorize the act, including one that was introduced in the 103d Congress containing substantive revisions similar to the revisions in this amendment, have all been referred to that committee. The fact that reauthorization of the Sikes Act is being done through the DOD authorization bill represents the fortuitous circumstance that after more than 1 year of debate, agreement happened to be reached by all parties at this particular time in this particular context. I do not expect that this circumstance would alter jurisdiction over the Sikes Act in the future. Nevertheless, the Committee on Environment and Public Works has always worked cooperatively on that portion of the Sikes Act pertaining to military installations in the past, and will continue to do so in the future. 
In closing, Mr. President, I believe that this amendment will improve the Sikes Act significantly, and represents a major achievement in environmental law in this Congress. The speed with which this legislation has moved in this Congress understates its importance both for the agenda of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and for efforts to conserve natural resources nationwide. I would especially like to thank both the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness, Senator Inhofe, and the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Armed Services and manager of the bill, Senator Thurmond, for their cooperation and efforts in facilitating approval of this amendment.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I strongly support the provisions within this bill establishing a Rail Trust Fund, and oppose this point of order. Let me first state my view that these provisions do not violate the spirit of the Byrd rule, which is intended to prevent unrelated authorization bills from being brought into the reconciliation process. Section 702 of this bill, which establishes an Intercity Passenger Rail Fund, is primarily tax legislation, which most certainly belongs on legislation entitled `The Tax Fairness Bill'. 
Establishment of a trust fund is a critical element in providing passenger rail with a stable, predictable source of revenue so that Amtrak can achieve financial viability and effectively serve millions of Americans. 
It is certainly no secret that Amtrak is in serious financial trouble. Earlier this year, the GAO continued a regular series of warnings in testifying to the Finance Committee on the precarious financial condition of the railroad. Amtrak President Tom Downs also confirmed to us that his railroad is in difficult shape. A number of States and communities have already felt the brunt of the railroad's financial predicament as often vital rail service has been discontinued. 
There are several factors contributing to Amtrak's condition, but primarily it is a result of outdated laws governing Amtrak's operation, as well as inadequate and inconsistent support from the Federal Government. Whatever the cause, I think we can all agree that Amtrak simply cannot continue to operate under the status quo. 
Amtrak's financial predicament has resulted in calls to end all Federal support for intercity passenger rail--there are those who would just throw up our hands in frustration and walk away. Mr. President, I am one who does not question the need for a Federal investment in passenger rail. The absence of passenger rail would clog our highways and airports--an additional 7,500 fully-booked 757's, or hundreds of thousands of cars, would be needed between Washington, DC, and New York every year. 
All major industrialized nations provide subsidies to passenger rail, usually to a greater extent than our Government's support for Amtrak. In fact, Amtrak covers more of its operating costs--an estimated 84 percent--than any other passenger railroad in the world. Nonetheless, Amtrak operates the only mode of transportation in the United States which does not have a dedicated source of funding. 
So the question before the Senate today is how best to provide needed Federal support for Amtrak's critical capital investment needs. After years of congressional hearings, GAO reports and strategic plans, I and many of my colleagues have concluded that dedicating a portion of the Federal gas tax to a Rail Trust Fund is the most appropriate and reliable means of ensuring that passenger rail can continue to meet America's transportation needs. Such a solution provides passenger rail with the same type of Federal support for capital improvements that other modes of transportation have enjoyed for years. 
This bill's creation of an Intercity Passenger Rail Fund financed by one-half cent of the gas tax, coupled with the needed operating reforms contained within the Amtrak authorization bill introduced by the Senator from Texas, will allow Amtrak to operate more like a business, end its reliance on Federal operating subsidies, and thus better serve America's transportation needs. 
At least for the 3 1/2 years that this Trust Fund is financed, we will start on the path to financial stability and end the annual financial roller coaster to which Amtrak is subjected. It would also avoid a catastrophic shutdown of Amtrak, which has recently been estimated to cost upwards of $5 billion dollars. 
Mr. President, Amtrak has presented to Congress a responsible 6-year strategic business plan which outlines how financial viability will be restored to the railroad. Amtrak's President Tom Downs deserves our praise for the monumental efforts he has undertaken to turn things around at his company. Congress should do its part and join him by providing a relatively modest Federal investment in passenger rail. I urge my colleagues to support this motion to waive the Budget Act.

Mr. CHAFEE. Senator Roth, as I know you are aware, because of the 1990 and 1993 Reconciliation Acts, our important freight railroads are forced to pay a 5.55 cents per gallon fuel tax into the General Treasury for deficit reduction. All other modes of transportation--highway, air, water--only pay 4.3 cents per gallon for this purpose. This is an obvious inequity. While reducing the Federal budget deficit is an important goal, if the transportation industry is to be singled out, the burden of achieving a balanced budget should be shared equally among all modes of transportation. 
I am particularly concerned because S. 949 would transfer the deficit reduction taxes paid by highway users, including truckers which compete with the railroads, into the Highway Trust Fund. Placing additional highway deficit reduction fuel taxes into the Highway Trust Fund for highway improvements would exacerbate the already inequitable situation, placing the railroad industry at an even more unfair competitive disadvantage. In essence, the railroads would continue to contribute to deficit reduction, while their competitors would instead contribute to their own infrastructure. 
The House has similarly proposed putting the aviation fuel taxes into the Airport and Aviation Trust Fund for airport infrastructure improvements as part of its tax reconciliation legislation. 
This injustice against America's railroads must be remedied at our earliest opportunity. I would ask the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee if he would be willing to seek a solution to this railroad deficit reduction fuel tax problem during the conference with the House on tax reconciliation legislation.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this afternoon to urge support for the tax bill reported out of the Finance Committee last week, and the bill that is before us today. Obviously I am not referring to the substitute, I am talking to the basic bill that came out of the Finance Committee with the support of 18 members in that committee. 
That vote, 18 to 2 in the committee, more than anything else is a clear indication of the bipartisan process in which the chairman of the Finance Committee crafted the legislation. Others have talked about the major provisions of this bill, all of which are extremely important. I would just like to touch on some lesser known provisions, if I might, briefly. 
The bill before us includes a permanent extension of the orphan drug credit. This provision encourages drug companies to conduct clinical research on rare, what they call orphan diseases, diseases that do not occur very often and thus there is not a large market for the drugs that are produced to care for that particular situation. Drug companies are reluctant to risk the investment or research dollars with such a small 
patient population, as, for example, exists for cystic fibrosis or hemophilia or Lou Gehrig's disease or Tourette's syndrome. This bill encourages and provides tax credits for those drug companies that spend the research money in these particular areas. 
The bill also includes an extension of the work opportunity tax credit, which is an important tool to encourage businesses to hire individuals on public assistance. We passed, last year, the Welfare Reform Act. We want opportunities for those coming off welfare to find a job. The work opportunity tax credit does this. Currently, under the law, it is required that the individual work 400 hours in a job before the tax credit is available to his employer. Under this legislation, the 400 hours is reduced to 120 hours--with a reduced credit, but nonetheless something that will encourage employers to hire these individuals. 
Another provision that is included in this particular section says that the work opportunity tax credit extends to disabled individuals, those receiving SSI benefits. This is a separate group from those coming off from welfare. 
Another provision in the bill, which I think is very significant, small though it is, is the estate tax incentive for the preservation of open space. America is losing 4 square miles a day to development, 4 square miles. In my State, over 11,000 acres of farmland have been lost to development since 1974. It is a small State. Think of that, 11,000 acres gone to development from farmland. What this does is provide that those individuals who currently, if they keep their open spaces, are subject to stiff estate taxes--thus either they have to go into development to pay the taxes or, when they have to, sell it to developers--this provides a lower estate tax for land, as long as the owner is willing to keep the land undeveloped in perpetuity. In other words, he has to sign a conservation easement, keeping the land open in perpetuity, so there will be some open spaces around our major cities, places where there can be habitat for wildlife and plants and fish. This is a very, very significant piece, this section that is in the bill, that Senator Roth was good enough to give us leadership on. 
Mr. President, I yield to the chairman the remainder of my time.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1997,--or, TIFIA. The purpose of the bill is to bridge the gap between the Nation's substantial infrastructure needs and limited Federal funds. I am pleased to report that Senators Graham of Florida, Boxer, Hatch, Bennett, and Moynihan have joined me in cosponsoring this important measure. 
I think we can all agree that there is a clear shortfall of public funding to meet the Nation's transportation needs. Our effort to balance the Federal budget only makes the challenge of meeting these critical needs all the more difficult. 
The goals of our bill are to offer the sponsors of major transportation projects a new tool to make the most of limited Federal resources, stimulate additional investment in our Nation's infrastructure, and encourage greater private sector participation in meeting our transportation needs. 
TIFIA establishes a new Federal credit program for surface transportation. It will provide $800 million in credit assistance over six years to public and private entities, with the purpose of leveraging as much as $16 billion in Federal funds for major transportation projects. In turn, this Federal investment could help leverage total investment in infrastructure from other public and private entities of $40 to $50 billion. Eligible forms of credit assistance available through our proposal include loans, loan guarantees, and lines of credit.

Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator is correct. Through the efforts of Senator Boxer, I have become aware of the need for border infrastructure investment and of her own legislation which has been referred to our committee. The Transportation Finance and Innovation Act embraces the innovative finance objectives of the Boxer bill. Border crossing facilities and multi-State trade corridors are clearly eligible and the selection criteria specifically includes those projects which promote international commerce. This bill will enable United States manufacturers to deliver their goods to domestic and foreign markets in a more timely, and cost-effective manner.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I think today, as we go on to 
further consideration of this Medicare legislation, we are going to really see who is concerned about the future of this program and who is concerned about it being there, not just to the end of this century, which is 3 years from now, but well into the next century. 
I think everybody who has taken the trouble to read the report of the trustees of Social Security and Medicare has seen the danger this program is in. It is going broke. It isn't something that is just automatically going to be there; we are used to these things. Somehow people think, `Oh, it can't happen.' Well, it can happen. So from the Finance Committee has come a series of proposals to do something about the security of the Medicare Program to ensure that it is going to be there, hopefully well into the next century. 
What is the particular issue before us today, Mr. President? The issue is, is it all right, proper, to have a $5 copayment in some instances--in some instances, Mr. President--for those who are visited by the home health care agents, officials, the nurses and those who come in a home health care visit. 
First, it is important to stress that after a hospital stay, for the first 100 visits, there is no charge. There is no charge for the first 100 visits after a hospital stay. Subsequent to that, there is a $5 charge. 
Under part B, for physicians' visits, and so forth, that an individual makes, there is a 20-percent copayment, and if that were applied to the home visits, 20 percent of a $90 visit--and that is the average cost of these visits from the visiting nurses or whoever it might be--20 percent of that is $18. Is the suggestion that there be an $18 copayment, 20 percent? No, there isn't, Mr. President. There is a charge of $5, which is in the neighborhood of 6 percent. Not a 20-percent charge, a 6 percent charge. It seems to me that that is very fair. First of all, it helps reduce the cost to Medicare, obviously. Second, it clearly, to some small extent, affects the behavior of the individual who has asked for the home health care visit. 
I think this is a fair charge, $5. It is not for everybody. As I say, the first 100 visits go without a charge whatsoever. One hundred visits is a lot of visits. Then it goes to this very modest, not 20-percent payment, but 6-percent payment. 
Mr. President, I hope that the amendment to remove this provision in the bill will be rejected. I thank the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there is an organization set up to report to the Congress every year on the status of Social Security and the status of Medicare. This group is a very distinguished group. It consists of the Secretary of the Treasury; the Secretary of Health and Human Services; the Secretary of Labor, or Acting Secretary of Labor; and the Commissioner of Social Security, or the Acting Commissioner of Social Security. These are the people, plus two members of the public. I might say, of the first four--and there are six in all--four of these are Democrats. They are not Republicans; they are Democrats. They submitted a report to us in the Congress in April of this year. What did they say? 
As we have reported for the last several years, one of the Medicare trust funds, the Hospital Insurance-- 
The HI, the so called part A. will be exhausted in 4 years without legislation that addresses its fiscal imbalance. 
This isn't a bunch of right wing Republicans saying there is trouble ahead. These are the very prestigious, qualified Cabinet Members of the President of the United States--every single one of them a Democrat. It goes on to say:  
We are urging the earliest possible enactment of legislation to further control Hospital Insurance program costs because of the nearness of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund exhaustion date. 
Mr. President, these are serious matters. They go on to explain why this is happening. 
On page 6 of its report it says: 
Why do costs rise faster than income? The primary reason for these costs of Social Security and the Hospital Insurance costs are because of the baby boom generation retirees, while the number of workers paying payroll taxes grows more slowly. 
Mr. President, we are facing an emergency here. This legislation, which came from the Finance Committee, proposes to do something about it. What is the situation? In 1950, which is 47 years ago, there were 16 workers for every retiree--16 workers in the United States paying into the Hospital Insurance Fund and paying into Social Security.

Mr. CHAFEE. As I said, 47 years ago, in 1950, there were 16 workers for every retiree. Today, there are 3 workers for every retiree--not 16, but 3. Twenty-eight years from now, in the year 2025, the ratio will fall to two workers for every retiree. So something has to be done if this Medicare trust fund is going to survive. 
What we have proposed is increasing the Medicare eligibility age to conform with that of Social Security. In 1983, we raised the age of Social Security eligibility gradually. It comes into full force in the year 2025. By the year 2025, the retirement age will be 67, not the 65 that it is today. 
We have proposed that the Medicare Program step up in similar fashion. The key thing, Mr. President, is to take these actions now; don't wait until the baby boomers are all there collecting and we can't do anything about it. Now, if we act, we can take these very gradual steps. For example, the first step will be in 2003, 6 years from now, when the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare will go from 65 to 65 and 2 months. Then it goes up to 65 and 10 months by the year 2007. Then we take a break for 11 years--excuse me. In 2008, it will be at age 66, and then gradually it goes up by 2 months and 4 months and 6 months until the year 2025, when the retirement age for Social Security----

Mr. CHAFEE. Social Security is already set. That goes to 67. We did that in 1983. That goes to age 67 in 2025. What we do in this program is to have Medicare conform to that. 
Mr. President, unless we take these actions, there isn't going to be any Medicare for the future. A lot of people say, `Do nothing.' Well, I think that is totally reckless. Other people can say, `Well, just increase the tax.' That would mean increasing the tax on Medicare by 250 percent. That is what would be required to increase the payroll tax. It would have to be increased from the current amount of 1.45 percent of payroll to 3.6 percent, which is nearly a threefold increase. 
So, Mr. President, this is a very wise provision that we did, in a bipartisan manner, in the Finance Committee, and I certainly hope that it will withstand any attacks. I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished chairman of our committee.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to briefly review the bidding here, if I might. Part B is a program that provides for payments to physicians; it is an insurance program. Nobody who is in Medicare has to take out this insurance program. Those that do pay a $45-per-month premium currently, over 99 percent of all Social Security beneficiaries, take the part B insurance. That is what it is--insurance. What is this premium that they pay the $45? That is calculated to cover 25 percent of the costs of the program, of the entire part B cost. Twenty-five percent is what an individual pays. So where is the other 75 percent coming from? The other 75 percent comes from the General Treasury. So you get this anomalous situation of a very low-income individual that might be the person that cleans the streets, if you will, or cleans up our offices early in the morning; that individual's income taxes go into the General Treasury, and then part of them come out to pay some millionaire retiree's doctor bills--75 percent of them. Now, something is wrong here. Why should those people be paying 75 percent of Warren Buffet's doctor bills? 
So what we have proposed here is that there be what we call a means test. The wealthier individuals will pay more for that premium instead of having it come out of the General Treasury. So did we start with low-income people? Hardly. Before anybody has to start paying more than the 25 percent premium, that individual, if he is an individual, as opposed to a married couple, that individual has to have an income of over $50,000 a year as a retiree. And it gradually comes in a greater portion, until finally that individual, if he is making $100,000 per year, is paying 100 percent of the premium. He doesn't have to take it if he doesn't want it. If he can go out and find a better deal somewhere, so be it. But I suspect he will find that this is a very, very good insurance program and he is delighted to pay the 100 percent, and he surely can afford it. It will only be $135 a month more, if he is paying the total premium, than if he were just paying the 25 percent. 
What about the married couple? There is talk here about how onerous this is. It doesn't even start with a married couple to pay more than the 25 percent until that couple is filing an income tax return showing that a $75,000 income. They don't pay the entire amount of the premium until their income is $125,000 a year. Where I come from that is a pretty good income. 
So, Mr. President, what we are trying to do is overcome this, I think, shocking situation where a very wealthy person is only paying 25 percent of the cost of a program with the taxpayers of the Nation. That cleaning woman, her taxes are going into that general fund to come out and pay some wealthy person's doctor bill--75 percent of them. That, Mr. President, just plain isn't fair. 
The question is whether we should debate it longer. I don't know how long it takes to understand the particular program we are proposing here this evening. Now, there are going to be savings. As the distinguished Senator from Louisiana pointed out, the savings are nearly $4 billion over 5 years. You can say, oh, that's not much. Boy, that is getting pretty inured to Washington spending if you say $4 billion isn't much. All that savings goes into the Medicare Program, the part A program, the hospital insurance, which is about to go under. Is it me that says that? No. 
We previously, this evening, quoted from the report of the trustees of the Medicare fund. Those trustees have used the most alarming words. I have here the little booklet that they put out in which they use terms of the part A trust fund, namely the Hospital Insurance. They use terms like--these are the trustees, and four of the six trustees are Cabinet officers, all Democrats. This is what they say:  
Further delay in implementing changes makes the problem harder to solve. We urge the earliest possible enactment of legislation to extend the HI trust fund. The Medicare trust fund, the HI, will be exhausted in 4 years without legislation to address it. 
It seems to me, Mr. President, that this is a very worthwhile undertaking. It is the right thing to do. It is not hurting anybody. If people at a $125,000-a-year income can't pay their entire insurance bill, then they are not doing their budgeting very well. 
So, Mr. President, I strongly support this measure, which was reported from the Finance Committee.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment with Senator Rockefeller and Senator Jeffords to ensure that the children's health insurance block grant, which is what we provided for from the Finance Committee, provides adequate health coverage for children and that it is affordable for most low-income families. 
Let me say I am very pleased in this package we have $24 billion, $24 billion set aside to provide health insurance coverage for some of the 10 million children in our Nation who are currently uninsured. I thank the chairman of the committee for helping us in many respects in connection with how this health care money is dispensed. 
There are two areas which remain of concern to me, namely what benefits are we going to provide to these children and how much are we going to require their parents to pay toward health insurance; in other words, deductibles and copayments. Under the Finance Committee bill, it provides that the benefits should be actuarially equivalent to the benefits provided under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. This, of course, is not a single plan. It is a menu of plans that Federal employees may choose from. These plans are designed to meet the needs of adult Federal workers and retirees, not children. Stating that the benefits must be actuarial equivalent, which means the same dollar value, does not spell out what benefits the children will get. Children could be denied critical benefits, such as vision and hearing care. 
Some may say the States will offer the benefits that children need, but that is not what the record shows. A survey by the National Governors' Association of the 28 non-Medicaid--in other words programs that are not pursuant to Medicaid-- 
State health programs for children found that they did not cover vision care in 16 of these plans; 16 out of 28 did not cover glasses for these poor children, and 10 didn't cover hearing defects. 
The amendment I am offering today would require that the benefits be at least the same as those under the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield benefit package, including hearing and vision services. 
We are talking about very low-income children here. These are children who live in families of three where the gross income is under $18,000. We are talking about children at 133 percent of the Federal poverty level. They do not have extra money to provide for eyeglasses or hearing aids. What we do is provide that the package be the same as the Blue Cross/Blue Shield package as far as benefits go. This is a standard package and it includes eyeglasses and hearing aids. 
In addition, we provide deductibles and copayments be eliminated for those who are--not eliminated, but be nominal for those from these very low-income families. So, that is the essence of it. It is a very good amendment. I wish it would be accepted. And I yield now--how much time do I have left?

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there are some saying, `Oh, you are giving them a Cadillac package.' It is just not so. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a comparison between what Medicaid provides, which some could say is a Cadillac package, and what we have in here, which we provide, which is just what the Blue Cross provides. You can see as you look down the list that Blue Cross does not cover shoes and corrective devices, transportation to medical services, family counseling, hearing care or vision care. So we go with the Blue Cross package with the exception of adding vision care and hearing assistance.

Mr. President, it is a good amendment and all it does is provide that we know what the benefits are going to be for these children and we include with the standard package known throughout the country through the FHEPA that we provide for the vision care and hearing assistance. 
Mr. President, I am delighted to support this package and would be delighted to have any other assistance, cosponsors.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the 50th anniversary of Salve Regina University, in Newport, RI. Salve Regina University is a private coeducational university of the arts and sciences, administered by the Sisters of Mercy. In commemoration of this milestone, the U.S. flag will be flown over the Capitol Building on September 2, 1997. 
As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, Salve Regina will host year-long activities, open to all, centered around the theme `The Enduring Power of Vision: Tradition, Achievement, Challenge.' These activities, including a conference on cultural and historical preservation, will take place on the university's 60-acre campus, bordering on the famed Cliff Walk in Newport. 
Mr. President, you may be interested to know that since the enrollment of its first class on September 24, 1947, the university has expanded to offer 29 undergraduate majors in the arts and sciences and 16 graduate programs, including a Ph.D. in Humanities. 
I am particularly pleased that the continued success and achievement of Salve Regina will be celebrated this year. And I am very proud to congratulate Salve Regina University for its 50 years of dedication and excellence in education.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I commend the Senators from North Carolina and Delaware for bringing this very important piece of legislation to the Senate floor. It has been many years since Congress has passed and the President signed a State Department Authorization bill. U.S. interests will be very well served if we are able to accomplish this very difficult but important task. 
I would like to address a key provision within S. 903, that being the U.N. reform plan. I have long had a deep interest in the world body, and this legislation offers the Senate an opportunity to better understand the many complex issues surrounding U.S. membership in the United Nations. 
There have been a number of what I consider to be unfortunate misconceptions raised about the United Nations in recent years that, in the context of this legislation, ought to be addressed in a forthright manner. American taxpayers deserve to know what benefits does the United States derives from its participation in the United Nations? A misconception one hears repeatedly is that the United States pays billions of dollars in U.N. dues, but gets little or nothing to show for it in return. I think it is important to rebut this allegation in order to more effectively make a case for full payment of our arrearages. 
The United Nations advances U.S. foreign policy goals in a number of ways, including isolation of nations that support terrorism, conflict resolution through diplomacy, the provision of humanitarian aid, and the promotion of democracy and human rights. These many successful ventures are too often overlooked as the more headline-grabbing failures of the U.N. seem to receive more attention by the news media. 
For example, U.N. economic sanctions serve to isolate and weaken regimes of nations such as Iraq, Libya, and others that routinely challenge United States interests abroad. Although these outlaw regimes remain in power, their ability to influence world events and undermine our interests are greatly reduced. I note the now-lifted U.N. sanctions on Serbia, which were instrumental in bringing that nation to the negotiations that eventually resulted in the Dayton peace accords. And we should also recall that Operation Desert Storm was conducted under the authority of a U.N.-passed resolution. 
The United Nations has also been instrumental in a number of peacemaking endeavors, including the brokering and implementation of peace agreements in the nearby, formerly war-ravaged nations of El Salvador and Guatemala. While I recognize and acknowledge the imperfect record of U.N. peacekeeping missions, particularly in Somalia and Bosnia, there have been successes in a number of 
lesser known parts of the world that are infrequently publicized. In any event, it should also be understood that the number of troops involved in U.N. peacekeeping operations has been reduced two-thirds over the past 2 years. 
What's more, the United Nations has been a forum in which international norms and standards of conduct are debated and established. These standards put the weight of international unity behind efforts to encourage good conduct on the part of all member states, particularly those that seek to do otherwise. During the 51st U.N. General Assembly alone, a number of important resolutions were adopted, with U.S. support, that promoted our national security interests. These resolutions sought to combat international crime, promote respect for human rights, and deplore the conduct of the repressive Burmese Government. I also note the work of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, an important organization which, among other things, puts needed pressure on many nations to fully respect the fundamental rights of its citizens. 
Mr. President, these are just some examples of how the United Nations and its affiliated organizations serve U.S. national security interests around the world. There are many more. It's vitally important that every Member of Congress understand exactly what we are receiving in return for our substantial investment at the United Nations in order to make the best judgment about how to proceed in addressing our unpaid dues. 
Another important misconception about the United Nations is the characterization of it as a bloated, uncontrolled bureaucracy that is unresponsive to calls for restraint. It is true that the United Nations and its administrative activities had seen enormous growth during its first several decades of existence. This growth and associated bureaucracy led to justified calls for reform and reduction. 
We must keep in mind that the United Nations has already undergone several reforms in the past decade, often at the urging of the U.S. Congress. Well before Secretary-General Kofi Annan assumed office, the United Nations had established an inspector general, reduced the number of high level posts, and cut both its peacekeeping and general budgets. And in the relatively short time since Annan has been Secretary-General, he has announced additional far-reaching reforms. On March 17, Annan specified a series of 10 reform benchmarks involving further budget cuts and restructuring. Included among these are a transfer of resources from administration to programs, establishment of a code of conduct for U.N. staff, and streamlining of his own office. Annan has done a great deal with the authority he has, while proposing additional measures that must be negotiated with member states. 
So no one should be left with the understanding that the United Nations is somehow immune from accountability and unresponsive to criticism. The world body, especially through its new Secretary-General, has heard the call for reform. Its leadership recognizes 
that it must be responsive to the concerns of member states, particularly its biggest donor, the United States. 
This brings us to today's debate. It has been my longstanding view that the United States absolutely must remain a full and active member of the United Nations. The many constructive activities of the United Nations. I have discussed, and the many U.S. interests that are served by our participation in the world body warrant a continued and strengthened U.S. role. Indeed, the 20th century has seen the tremendous consequences that result when the United States shrinks from its inevitable leading role in world affairs. In fact, I would argue that the increasing complexity of the challenges confronting the United States today make it more important than ever that we remain engaged internationally by, among other things, fully participating in the United Nations. 
And we certainly cannot adequately participate in the United Nations by continuing to carry an arrearage of around $1 billion. Because of this arrearage, our respect and credibility there has diminished, thereby limiting United States ability to influence positively the United Nations' deliberations and activities. As the sole remaining superpower in an increasingly complex world, the United States simply must play a leading and unimpeded role at the United Nations. 
While I am extremely pleased about the willingness of the Senator from North Carolina to engage in negotiations to clear up our arrearage, I believe that paying our back dues in full without the onerous conditions of title 22 is the appropriate course of action. It appears unlikely that the United Nations will, in fact, agree to this package as a whole, particularly given the lukewarm initial reaction of its leadership. This reaction is certainly understandable. Could you imagine if every member state made demands such as this in return for full payment of dues? 
What would best serve U.S. interests is to pay off our arrearage now and encourage our diplomats to undertake a very serious effort to negotiate further reforms with a Secretary-General who appears strongly committed to genuine change. I am greatly concerned that the substantial progress we have already made in working with Kofi Annan could be jeopardized by enactment of these mandates. It is no surprise that many member states of the U.N. have said that these conditions are a mere starting point for further negotiations. Such an interpretation, if accepted by the body as a whole, would simply put us back at square one with a $1 billion arrearage. 
Rather than debating how best to pay our back dues, we should instead focus on the more fundamental question of whether or not the United States ought to be a member of the United Nations at all. If we do decide that it's in our interests to remain there, then we should simply pay our dues and move on. It is imperative that the United States remain engaged, rather than withdraw, from world affairs and institutions such as the United Nations. I urge my colleagues to support the Lugar/Sarbanes amendment.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr, President, I would like to make a few remarks about the nomination of Maj. Gen. Robert Bernard Flowers to be member and president of the Mississippi River Commission. Last Thursday, June 5, the Committee on Environment and Public Works unanimously reported out General Flowers' nomination. 
General Flowers has an impressive background. He has served in the U.S. Army since 1969 and is a registered professional engineer. General Flowers presently is the Army Corps of Engineers Division Commander of the Lower Mississippi Valley, which comprises districts headquartered in St. Louis, Memphis, Vicksburg and New Orleans. In his current position, General Flowers oversees the Corps of Engineers' water resources program in this 156,000 square mile area of the lower Mississippi Valley. 
General Flowers' experience will serve him well in the position before him. If confirmed as president of the Mississippi River Commission, General Flowers will be responsible for the planning and implementation of a program to control and develop the lower Mississippi Valley. The MRC also is responsible for the management and oversight of the Mississippi Rivers and Tributaries Project. 
I might add that General Flowers is no stranger to the flooding and issues involved in controlling the Mississippi River. In fact, he was unable to join the Committee at his confirmation hearing this past March because of the urgency of terrible flooding in that area. He is a dedicated individual who will continue to be an asset to the Mississippi River and the Nation alike. Thank you.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about the nomination of Michael Armstrong to be Associate Director of Mitigation for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The President nominated Mr. Armstrong for this position on April 28. Last Thursday, June 9, the Committee on Environment and Public Works unanimously reported out Mr. Armstrong's nomination. 
During Mr. Armstrong's confirmation hearing, Senators Campbell, Allard, Conrad, and Dorgan, as well as Representatives Skaggs and Pomeroy, spoke in support of his nomination. In addition, Senator Daschle, Governor Romer of Colorado, Governor Racicot of Montana, Governor Janklow of South Dakota, and the Association of State Floodplain Managers have written letters of recommendation on Mr. Armstrong's behalf. 
I am pleased to report that Michael Armstrong has an impressive background that suits him well to the position before him. For the past 3 1/2 years, he has served as the Director of FEMA Region 8, which includes the States of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. 
Mr. Armstrong has done an excellent job as Region 8 director. He has assumed tremendous leadership during major disasters, such as the recent floods in North Dakota. Moreover, Mr. Armstrong has done a great deal to encourage public outreach and coordination between Federal, State, and local response resources. 
FEMA is the central agency within the Federal Government responsible for emergency planning, preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. The position for which Mr. Armstrong has been nominated, Associate Director of Mitigation, carries out FEMA's policies and programs to eliminate or reduce risks to life and property from natural hazards such as floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes. 
Federal emergency management has always focused primarily on how to respond to a disaster, after it strikes. We in Congress are no different; almost every year, we pass supplemental emergency appropriations legislation to pay for the additional, unanticipated costs of timely disasters. 
FEMA is beginning to place greater emphasis on the mitigation or prevention of long-term risks before the disaster strikes. The purpose of this shift in focus is hopefully to reduce liabilities and ultimately to reduce the cost of disaster response. This appears to be a smart move, and we are all eager to see FEMA succeed in carrying out this initiative. 
If confirmed, Mr. Armstrong will lead FEMA's efforts in mitigating the risks of natural disasters. This task is not an easy one, but I am confident in Mr. Armstrong's ability to face the challenge ahead.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce The Medicaid Managed Care Act of 1997. This legislation meets two very important objectives in the Medicaid Program. First, it gives States the additional flexibility they need to administer the Medicaid Program by allowing them to enroll Medicaid beneficiaries into managed care Programs. Second, the bill sets Federal standards for managed care to ensure that Medicaid patients receive the same quality of care as those patients who are enrolled in private managed care plans. 
Under our legislation, States could require Medicaid patients to enroll in managed care plans without going through the lengthy and cumbersome process of applying to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for a waiver of current Medicaid regulations. In exchange for this important flexibility, States will have to meet a set of minimum Federal standards to ensure that Medicaid patients continue to receive quality care. 
For example, States would be required to offer patients a choice of at least two health plans. Plans would be required to meet certain standards of access to care, quality, and solvency. These standards are especially important given recent problems in States that have set up Medicaid managed care programs under the waiver process. In some instances, plans have failed to contract with enough providers to serve the Medicaid population. Some have been permitted to operate under standards that are lower than commercial insurers are required to meet, and others have used fraudulent marketing practices to entice Medicaid patients to sign up with their plans. These actions have resulted in patients being denied medically necessary services, and have resulted in States and the Federal Government paying for care that was never given. 
Considering these abuses, why should we allow Medicaid managed care at all? Because managed care, if implemented correctly, can vastly improve the quality of health care provided to low-income families. In today's fee-for-service program, patients face myriad problems. Some are forced to get care in hospital emergency rooms because they cannot find a private physician willing or able to accept Medicaid's low payment rates. Those who do have access to providers often must wait for hours in clinics which are overcrowded and understaffed. And, sadly, they often do not have access to primary and preventive care services which would have prevented them from becoming ill to begin with. 
Medicaid managed care, if done well, provides regular prenatal care to assure that children are born healthy. These plans provide coverage for check-ups and immunizations to prevent serious illnesses. And they give patients a medical home--a provider they know they can go to if they are sick, or a number to call if they have questions. 
Medicaid managed care also has the potential of benefiting our overall health care system by providing access to primary care providers rather than forcing patients to make costly and unnecessary visits to hospital emergency rooms. It gives providers the opportunity to catch and treat, or prevent, costly health problems. 
Mr. President, we have worked very hard to ensure that this legislation strikes an appropriate balance between the needs of Medicaid beneficiaries and the managed care companies. I want to thank Senators Breaux and Kerrey who helped craft this legislation and are original cosponsors. I also want to thank the many advocacy organizations for their input and support. And I also want to thank some of the managed care organizations who worked with us. I am especially pleased that some of these organizations, such as the HMO Group which is an alliance of health maintenance organizations have endorsed this legislation. Their support is critical to the success of Medicaid managed care.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted to join in congratulating Senator Thurmond on attaining the distinction of being the Nation's longest serving U.S. Senator. 
Since coming to the Senate a little over 20 years ago, I have respected Senator Thurmond's abilities, admired his tenacity, valued his judgment, and treasured his friendship. He is an inspiration to all of us, not only because of the length of his service, but because of the quality of his work and the depth of his commitment. 
All of us marvel at the sheer duration of Strom Thurmond's tenure in the Senate--42 years. But we congratulate him today not only for his longevity, but for dedicating most of his adult life to public service. As a school teacher and a coach, as an attorney, as a soldier who participated in the D-day landing at Normandy, as a State senator, as a circuit court judge, as Governor of South Carolina, and as U.S. Senator, Strom Thurmond has repeatedly sought out opportunities to serve his community, State, and Nation. 
And, due to his reputation for hard work and effective leadership, the people of South Carolina have repeatedly demonstrated their confidence in him--a degree of confidence among the voters that all of us aspire to but few achieve. 
Senator Thurmond's unflagging vigor is evident to anyone who shakes his hand--his handshake is firm and formidable. All of us hope and expect that he will stay in the Senate until he reaches the age of 100 and beyond.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to help resolve the most serious problem identified by patrons and visitors of the Kennedy Center--the lack of adequate on-site parking. Joining me today as original cosponsors are: Senators Baucus and Kennedy. 
This legislation provides authority to the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees to construct an addition to the existing parking garage at each of the north and south ends of the Center. Importantly, Mr. President, the garage addition authorized in this bill will come at a cost to the Federal Government. The project will be financed through the issuance of industrial revenue bonds which will be repaid entirely with revenue derived from operation of the expanded garage. Indeed, a provision included in the legislation explicitly prohibits the use of appropriated funds for the purpose of constructing or financing the parking garage expansion. 
Also included in the bill is authorization for the Center to take action on site modifications for the improvement of security on the site. The Center has conducted a complete security review, and among the recommendations are changes to the main approach and plaza. This legislation allows the Center to pursue site modifications for the protection of the building and its visitors. 
Consistent with the John F. Kennedy Center Act Amendments of 1994, the Center's plans for the garage expansion and other related site improvements will be developed in close consultation with the Department of Interior. In fact, the National Park Service sent a letter today to the president of the Kennedy Center, Mr. Lawrence J. Wilker, conveying its approval of the conceptual plan for this project. 
Mr. President, let me say that this proposal reflects the commitment of the Kennedy Center trustees to continually improve this Presidential monument for the benefit of the Public--in a manner that is financially responsible. And indeed, the Center is an operation run in a financially sound way. 
A little-known fact about the Kennedy Center is that 90 percent of the Center's annual operating income is derived from private sources. The Federal Government provides only 10 percent of the Center's annual operating income--and these Federal funds are carefully limited to nonperformance activities. This legislation maintains that impressive private-to-Federal funding ratio. 
I am proud to serve as a trustee of the Kennedy Center, and commend the board for its stewardship of this treasured asset--the national center for the performing arts and living memorial to the late President. 
In closing, Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Baucus and Kennedy for their help in drafting this bill. I look forward to working with them and other colleagues to secure timely adoption of the measure.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the bill. 
I rise in opposition today to the amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Montana. I might say, these are two Senators for whom I have tremendous respect. I have worked with them. The Senator from Virginia, I think we first started our association in 1969, and the Senator from Montana, I started working with him the first year he came to the Senate, which I think was 1978, 1979, and we have been closely associated ever since. 
However, this amendment, which would increase outlays for transportation spending above the levels provided in the resolution before us, I find to be inconsistent with the achievement of a balanced budget by the year 2002. 
The Senator from Virginia just said it went beyond the bill, the so-called NEXTEA bill that goes beyond this, and that is absolutely right, but that was before we had a target from the Budget Committee. I believe strongly in the budgetary process we have set up. I voted for it, and I support it. 
I think we all can agree that the Nation's roads and bridges are in need of repair. No one argues with that. Transportation plays a critical role in our Nation's economy. We recognize that. In the United States, more than 12 million people, more than 11 percent of the gross national product, is involved in transportation. 
Earlier this year, I cosponsored a measure to increase, within the context of a unified budget, the level of transportation spending from the highway trust fund. I am pleased that the budget agreement, crafted by the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from New Jersey, increases the spending levels implicit in that proposal, the so-called 
Bond-Chafee proposal. It is $13 billion over a freeze baseline. That is pretty good. 
Would we like more? Sure we would. But I think it is terribly important to recognize that any proposal that boosts highway spending or transportation spending without corresponding offsets is something I personally cannot support. So, I agree with Senators Warner and Baucus that transportation spending should be increased, but not in a manner that would undermine the careful agreement reached by the Budget Committee. 
Do we like everything in this budget? No, but it is the best we can get. I am supporting that agreement. It seems to me we simply cannot afford to retreat from our efforts to eliminate the Federal deficit. 
So that, Mr. President, is the reason I cannot support this amendment that is before us today. I thank the Chair and thank the manager and thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee that deals with these matters. He has worked on them, and I know his heart is in this. As always, he argues his case with vigor and considerable force.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, what this does is it takes $40 billion over the 5 years that is now going into the General Treasury and puts it into the highway trust fund with, obviously, the assumption that it is going to be spent. In effect, what we are doing here is adding $40 billion to the deficit of the United States. 
I just don't think, when we are in this effort of trying to balance the budget, that this is the right step to take. Do we all want to have more highways? Of course, we do. Indeed, it falls under the very committee of which I am the chairman. I don't think at this time, when we are making these efforts to balance the budget, that we want to take $40 billion over 5 years going into the General Treasury and spend it in this manner. So I hope the amendment will be defeated.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I intend to vote for the Hatch-Kennedy amendment. It is paid for by a 43-cent-per-pack increase in the Federal excise tax on cigarettes. We must do everything we can to discourage smoking and to advance good health policy. In my view, this does both. 
However, in doing so, I want to be very clear about my order of priorities in terms of addressing the children's health crisis in this country. If the Hatch-Kennedy amendment fails, and we do not get any additional spending for children's health initiatives above and beyond the $16.8 billion already included in this budget resolution, I intend to place all of my energies behind strengthening the very cornerstone of our Federal efforts to provide health insurance to poor children--the Medicaid Program. 
My first priority will be to work in the Finance Committee to enact the Chafee-Rockefeller-Jeffords-Breaux bill which provide incentives--not mandates--to encourage States to expand their Medicaid programs to cover all children aged 18 and under, up to 150 percent of poverty. Through this voluntary Medicaid expansion, which now has the support of a majority of the members of the Senate Finance Committee, we can strengthen the system already in place across the country to reach up to 5 million more children. This is the most cost-effective way to proceed, does not create any new entitlement programs, and is a known quantity in every State. 
What am I saying here? Let us strengthen the foundation before we build the building. In an environment of scarce resources, we must first work to reach the very neediest children through the Medicaid Program before we create other programs with potentially overlapping objectives. I would have a very different view if we had unlimited resources, but we do not. 
I would now like to recognize Senators Rockefeller and Jeffords to get an indication of their priorities.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee for their help on this amendment. 
The amendment before the Senate addresses the treatment of poor, elderly legal immigrants who are dependent on SSI benefits. SSI is a Federal program that provides cash assistance to those who are either elderly or disabled, and of very low income. 
Pursuant to last year's welfare law, legal immigrants may no longer receive SSI benefits. Those who were receiving SSI on the date the law was enacted therefore are scheduled to lose that assistance beginning on August 1 of this year, although thanks to an amendment I offered with Senator D'Amato and others to the disaster relief bill, that cutoff date likely will be pushed back to October 1. 
In my view, the welfare law's SSI restrictions were not only harsh, but unfair, particularly to those elderly or disabled legal immigrants who were relying on those critical benefits at the time. It seems an increasing number of Senators and Representatives agree. Therefore, this year Congress is considering proposals to revise the legal immigrant SSI restrictions. 
The particular proposal suggested by the budget resolution addresses immigrants' plight by exempting from the SSI ban those who are disabled and who were in the country when the bill was signed. While that is an important step toward fairness, it would mean that legal immigrants who are elderly, but not disabled, would be left out, and would lose their SSI benefits. 
If this proposal were enacted, the Social Security Administration would need to re-evaluate all the elderly SSI recipients to determine how many would requalify as disabled. That process would take perhaps 6 months. The question then would become the fate of these elderly recipients during the redetermination time. Would they be dropped from the program during those six months, and then be reinstated later if they requalified? Or would they be allowed to continue on the program until it was clear whether or not they would requalify? 
Senators Feinstein, D'Amato, DeWine, and I believe that in that situation, it makes absolutely no sense to kick elderly recipients off of SSI during the redetermination period, only to reinstate many of them at a later date. However, as written, the budget resolution is silent on this point. Therefore, we worked with Senator Domenici to clarify this issue. The amendment before us would ensure that elderly recipients would be allowed to continue to receive this critical SSI assistance during the time it would take to redetermine their status. 
This clarification makes sure that should the proposal in the budget resolution be enacted, elderly legal immigrants will be treated with compassion and not subjected to the sudden and perhaps unwarranted loss of basic assistance. 
Mr. President, I want to point out that the proposal suggested by the budget resolution is an important one, but it is just one of the many that the Finance Committee may consider during the upcoming reconciliation process. As I mentioned, I believe that the budget resolution approach, as clarified by our amendment, goes a long way toward restoring fairness for vulnerable legal immigrants who were in the country and playing by the rules when the welfare law was enacted. But I must say that I am sorely disappointed that the budget resolution proposal leaves elderly legal immigrants--those who by definition have no other source of income and are too old and frail to work--out in the cold. To my view, then, the budget resolution proposal therefore addresses only part of the problem, and I intend to work with my colleagues here and in the Finance Committee toward a more comprehensive solution.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today Senators Roth, Moynihan, and I, along with others on the Finance Committee, are introducing legislation to clarify the meaning of most favored nation [MFN] trading status--a change I have advocated for some time. 
Over the past few years, MFN has gained notoriety as a special favor that the U.S. grants to other nations. Not true. Indeed, MFN is a misnomer if there ever was one. 
Rather, MFN refers to a centuries-old concept used by all trading nations--the concept that no nation shall be granted trade treatment less favorable than that granted to the most-favored-nation. In other words, no playing favorites! Every nation is to receive equal treatment when it comes to the terms of trade. 
Thus, the MFN concept represents the lowest common denominator of trade status. 
Over the centuries, this simple non-discrimination concept came to be known as most favored nation status. Frankly, that is unfortunate. That particular terminology has fostered the mistaken view that MFN is a special treatment granted only to a privileged few. Yet just the opposite is true: MFN, as the basic trading status between nations, is granted to virtually all nations with whom the U.S. trades. The exceptions can almost be counted on one hand: Serbia, Laos, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Cuba, and North Korea. 
In sum, while the concept of MFN is sound, the term used to denote that concept is misleading and has resulted in a good deal of mischief--a fact that Senators Moynihan and I have lamented often during Senate Finance Committee hearings. It is high time that we called the MFN nondiscrimination concept by a term that more accurately represents its meaning. 
Therefore, today my colleagues and I are introducing this bill to amend U.S. law, where appropriate, to replace the term `MFN' with the term `NTR'; normal trade relations. From this point on, we will discuss legislation and hold debate on the nondiscrimination concept using the term `NTR' in place of MFN. 
Will the concept of MFN remain the same? Yes. Are we signalling a change in domestic policy, or modifying our international obligations in any way? No. But we are making perfectly clear to everyone the true meaning and purpose of this centuries-old concept. And it is my hope that our legislation will result in a better understanding of international trade relations, both here in the Congress and in the eyes of the public. 
Last year, Senators Roth, Moynihan, and I introduced a virtually identical bill, again with the support of Finance Committee members. That bill sailed through the Senate unanimously, and was sent to the House of Representatives. However, the house was not able to act on the bill prior to the date of adjournment of the 104th Congress. It is my hope that by introducing this bill tody, there will be more than enough time this year to move the measure through both chambers and send it to the President for his signature. I therefore urge swift consideration of our legislation by the Senate.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am joining with Senator Baucus to introduce legislation authorizing the President to extend most-favored-nation, or normal trading relations, status to China on a permanent basis. 
Since 1989, Congress has engaged in an annual, and very public, debate about the extension of MFN to China. These debates have been highly charged. But over the years, the repetition of this debate has carried a heavy price tag, with little to no positive results to show for it. 
In fact, the constant debate as to whether or not the United States should continue normal trade relations with China has come at great expense to the overall health of the bilateral relationship between these two great and powerful nations. And that, in turn, has had real--and negative--repercussions for the United States, its citizens, and even the Chinese people themselves. We need to look toward a day where this annual MFN rollercoaster will be replaced by a stable, long-term economic foundation between these two superpowers. It is toward that end that we are introducing this legislation.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by Senators Warner and Graham. 
I want to emphasize that the situation before us today is not a new one. It started in 1994, when the Department of Treasury made a clerical error in determining the amount of money going out to the States from the highway trust fund. This accounting error changed the distribution of highway funds in 1996 and 1997. 
In late July of last year, during consideration of the Department of Transportation Appropriations bill, Senator Baucus and I tried to fix this error. Our amendment would have required that the funds be distributed as if the accounting error had never happened. We thought this was an honest and fair way to deal with this problem. 
Unfortunately, this amendment was strongly opposed by some of our colleagues even though it was a fair and even-handed solution to a technical accounting error. As most of my colleagues are aware, votes on highway funds are often determined according to how each Senator thinks his or her individual State fares, and the vote last year was no different. 
Since last July, the Departments of Treasury and Transportation have corrected the error. That should have been the end of the story, but, for some reason, the President has requested an additional $318 million to compensate the 24 States that would have received additional funds had the error been left in place. I think it is unfortunate that the administration, which made the accounting error in the first place, has reopened this issue, by seeking a supplemental appropriation. This issue has been needlessly divisive and, in seeking to have it both ways, the administration's decision has reopened old wounds. 
The Appropriations Committee has included not only the administration's request, but also $139 million to fully compensate States that did not receive their share of 1996 funds because the error was not corrected until 1997. In addition, the Committee has included $475 million for 31 States to bring their 1997 limitation up to 1996 levels. While I disagree with the decision to include the $318 million requested in the first place, I believe that the committee's inclusion of additional funds reflects the fairest compromise available to make all States whole. 
The proponents of the amendment before us argue that the additional funds included by the Appropriations Committee contradict ISTEA formulas, giving an unfair advantage to 29 States. When the shoe was on the other foot and we argued that it was unfair for some States to receive a benefit from a bureaucratic error, our argument fell on deaf ears. Mr. President, this claim of unfairness today rings hollow. 
The additional funds provided by the Appropriations Committee hardly gives an unfair advantage to 29 States. In fact, the only States that actually receive additional funds in 1997, when compared to 1996, are the so-called donor States that are offering the amendment before us today. 
Mr. President, this is an issue that, in my opinion, was resolved after the administration initially fixed its error last December. Unfortunately, the administration has reopened this complicated issue. The Appropriations Committee has developed a fair solution to a difficult problem and they should be congratulated. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and support the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
While we are focused on the distribution of funds to the States I would like to say a few words about the formulas in the context of ISTEA reauthorization. I realize that some Members of this body believe that the current formulas that distribute highway funds are neither fair nor appropriate. Many Members argue that various factors, such as interstate highway mileage, State population, highway trust fund contributions, and the number of deficient bridges should be given greater weight or importance in the distribution formula. I think we can all agree that we have a long and difficult task before us in determining the appropriate formula for the next ISTEA. I therefore urge my colleagues to make every effort to work with, rather than against, one another in crafting a fair distribution formula that benefits the States and the national system alike. Thank you.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to report after much debate and negotiation, my distinguished colleagues--Senator Kempthorne, Senator Reid, Senator Baucus, Senator Craig--and I have reached an agreement on language relating to the Endangered Species Act requirements for emergency flood control activities. I want to also say that the administration was a big help in this agreement. They were in on our negotiations. 
Our amendment will ensure that the requirements of the Endangered Species Act will not impede actions to address emergency situations. It removes any uncertainty that the emergency procedures in the Endangered Species Act and its implementing regulations shall apply in those situations, and it resolves several ambiguities and procedures. It is a significant resolution that will not only expedite the passage of the Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act--the main bill we are on here--but it also represents a promising step in our ongoing efforts to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act itself. 
Briefly, I will touch on that. This, in my judgment, represents a significant step forward on the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act which we are now working on in the Environment and Public Works Committee, and especially in the subcommittee headed by Senator Kempthorne, with Senator Reid being the ranking member. 
I thank my colleagues for their hard work on this issue. We took a lot of time. I especially want to thank Senator Kempthorne and Senator Reid because of the hard work that they applied in bridging the differences between the original Craig amendment and the Reid amendment. I also want to thank the senior Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig, who was very, very helpful in reaching this final accord. Everybody gave a little bit of something. That is why we are here today. 
Mr. President, the floods that have devastated much of the Midwestern and Western United States have been a tragedy of immeasurable dimensions, both financially and emotionally for all of the affected communities. The Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act will provide desperately needed funds to continue the rebuilding process in those communities. It should be passed without any controversial riders that will slow its progress and threaten a veto. 
No one can disagree with the absolute need to ensure that flood damage is minimized and that emergency flood response measures can go forward without unnecessary impediments. Nothing should compromise our efforts to save lives and homes in times of emergencies, catastrophic events and other disasters. These efforts must include measures to response adequately to threats to health and safety as well measures to repair damaged flood control projects quickly and efficiently. 
At the same time, there is a belief that the requirements of the Endangered Species Act do not allow for such exigencies, and that the act is inflexible and unworkable. This is a mistaken belief. The ESA itself and its implementing regulations explicitly allow for emergency actions to proceed without delay. Only after the emergency would the Fish and Wildlife Service or National Marine Fisheries Service formally review the action to determine its effects on endangered or threatened species, and whether such action requires any mitigation. 
The FWS recently issued a policy for emergency flood control actions that expounds on these emergency provisions and gives them specific application to parts of California. The FWS has not only agreed to emergency procedures upon request by the Federal action agency, but it has invited action agencies to use the emergency provisions of the law. 
Mr. President, let me set the record straight: The Administration--both the Army Corps of Engineers and the Fish and Wildlife Service--believe that these policies and procedures have addressed the needs of the emergencies adequately. These provisions indicated that the ESA itself has the flexibility to address emergency situations, so that a full exemption from the ESA is not required. To argue otherwise is just not accurate. Upon careful review of the anecdotes that abound, it has not been demonstrated that the ESA has impeded emergency response efforts. 
But just as emergency flood control activities are to be carried out without impediments, it is equally important to recognize that such activities can have long-term impacts on the environment, including fish and wildlife and their habitat. Merely because an action must be taken to address an emergency does not mean that it has no effects on wildlife, or that those effects need not be considered subsequent to the emergency. When necessary and appropriate, the impacts of these activities on our natural resources should be mitigated. Indeed, Congress has explicitly required such mitigation in the Army Corps of Engineer's own authorities, such as the Water Resources Development Act. 
The ESA, in turn, contains its own requirements with respect to endangered and threatened wildlife. Specifically, section 7(a)(2) requires that each Federal agency ensure that its actions are not likely to jeopardize listed species, and section 7(b)(4) requires that FWS or NMFS specify reasonable and prudent measures to minimize the impacts of any taking of such species. 
The fact that mitigation is required both in the corps' statutory authority and in the ESA underscores the dual purpose of mitigation: Not only is it important for protection of wildlife, it is also important for effective management of the flood plain. Effective flood plain management requires adoption of measures to reduce flood damage, as well as measures to reduce future susceptibility to floods. These measures go hand in hand with protection of the flood plain resources themselves. Mitigation is thus an important component of flood control that cannot be ignored. 
Yesterday, the House of Representatives debated and defeated the original version of H.R. 478, a bill that provided a sweeping exemption of all operations, maintenance, repair, and restoration of flood control facilities. While this exemption ostensibly was intended to address emergency situations, one does not have to read between the lines to see that H.R. 478 would have exempted all actions relating to flood control facilities from the ESA, even without any emergency situation. That bill was nothing more than a transparent attempt to use the ESA as a scapegoat for natural disasters and thus exempt a broad category of activities from the law, in perpetuity, under the guise of an emergency. I strongly oppose the terms of that bill, as well as similar bills or amendments in either the House or Senate. 
By contrast, my distinguished colleagues--Senators Kempthorne, Craig, Baucus, and Reid--and I have negotiated an amendment to S. 672, with involvement by the administration, that is narrowly tailored to remove any uncertainty that the emergency procedures under the ESA shall apply in emergency situations. Let me repeat: The emergency procedures of the ESA shall apply in emergency situations. This would not require either an exemption nor an amendment to the current law. Our amendment does not contain language that could be misconstrued to create emergencies when none exist. Our amendment considers emergency situations to be those natural events that cause an imminent threat to human lives and property. Our amendment applies to emergencies that occurred in 1996 or at any time during 1997. We are including 1996 to ensure that flood control facilities damaged in last year's floods can be repaired expeditiously, to address emergencies that might arise this year. There is no sunset provision in our amendment, because of this inherent temporal limitation to emergencies only in 1996 and 1997. 
Our amendment effectively codifies the current practice of the administration to defer formal consultation until after the emergency is over. This practice provides that the Federal agency taking the emergency action will consult informally with either FWS or NMFS at any time prior to or during the emergency. This informal consultation can be nothing more than a phone call between the agencies. 
More importantly, our amendment resolves several ambiguities as to application of the existing emergency provisions. First, it makes clear that it is the Federal action agency that will have the discretion to determine whether an emergency exists. 
Second, it clarifies that the actions to which this provision applies are repairs as needed to respond to an emergency causing an imminent threat to human lives and property, until that threat has been abated. This is consistent with the description of emergency actions in the statute and regulations of the Army Corps of Engineers. The corps considers emergency activities to include flood emergency preparation, flood fighting and rescue operations, postflood response, and emergency repair and restoration of flood control works. These measures are designed to meet an imminent flood threat, while permanent rehabilitation of flood control works are considered separately. Our amendment includes those emergency measures, and does not include routine maintenance and operations that would otherwise require ESA consultation. 
Third, it makes clear that repairs can include both preventive and remedial measures to restore the project to a condition to remove an imminent threat to human lives and property. 
Lastly, the amendment would require that reasonable and prudent measures be related both in nature and extent to the effect of the action. The current law requires that reasonable and prudent measures must not alter the basic design, location, scope, duration, or timing of the action and may involve only minor changes. This requirement makes sense for proposed actions that have yet to be taken. However, it does not apply well to actions already taken, such as those necessary to address emergencies. There have been instances where FWS has specified measures that the action agency feels go too far, but about which the agency can do nothing because its action has already been completed. Our amendment would ensure that reasonable and prudent measures specified for an action already taken or currently in progress will be similar in scope to measures that may be required for proposed actions. 
It is important to note that the measures must be related to the effects of the action on listed species, not to the cost or nature of the action itself. Furthermore, by including this requirement, we do not prohibit any particular type of reasonable and prudent measure, such as offsite mitigation. 
Mr. President, Senator Kempthorne and I have been working diligently together to reauthorize the ESA. We issued a discussion draft for reauthorization in late January 1997, and we have since been negotiating with the minority members of the Committee on Environment and Public Works and the administration. My strong preference is to avoid any amendments relating to the ESA in this, or any other, appropriations bill. The proper context in which to discuss whether the ESA needs to address emergency situations better, and how the ESA should define reasonable and prudent measures, is our reauthorization process, not here. My other goal is to avoid a contentious debate on the ESA when we are trying to pass an appropriations bill expeditiously, and when we are trying also to reauthorize the ESA itself expeditiously. I believe that our amendment accomplishes both of those goals. 
In sum, our amendment will ensure that the requirements of the Endangered Species Act will not impede actions to address emergency situations. It removes any uncertainty that the emergency procedures in the ESA and its implementing regulations shall apply in those situations, and it further resolves several ambiguities in those procedures. It is a significant resolution that will not only expedite passage of the Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act, but also represents a promising step in our ongoing efforts to reauthorize the ESA itself. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. 
I thank my colleagues for their hard work in this issue, especially Senator Kempthorne, who worked tirelessly with me to bridge the differences between the original Craig amendment and the Reid amendment. The amendment on which we agree today is based on an amendment filed by Senator Kempthorne. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, first, I congratulate Senator D'Amato for his work on this amendment which will mean so much to so many people who he has well described as being the frailest in our society. 
I also pay tribute to Senator Feinstein with whom I have worked on a program similar to this for the long-term solution, as she pointed out. It may well be that we will turn to that when we start the new fiscal year. 
I also want to salute Senator DeWine, who is not on the floor at this moment. I hope he will be here soon. But I wanted to pay tribute to him because he has worked very hard on it. 
Mr. President, I would like to extend my thanks to the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Senator from Alaska, and the distinguished ranking member of that committee, the Senator from West Virginia, who have agreed to accept this amendment. I am very appreciative of that. 
I am speaking on behalf of 3,750 legal immigrants--legal immigrants--in my State who would face the loss of these SSI benefits but for the passage of this legislation, which I hope will be accepted in the House likewise. That group of 3,750 Rhode Island seniors, as the Senator from New York has described, fits in that typical pattern of 18 percent being over 85 and so forth. 
Mr. President, this is a good amendment. What it does, it gets us through the remainder of this fiscal year and gives us a little breathing time. 
Mr. President, as you know, in the underlying bill there is a block grant of $125 million. This replaces that. I think that is wise because a block grant would cause a lot of problems in its distribution, trying to set up a new system to get the money out. The continuation of the existing system of the SSI benefits is, I believe strongly, the right way to go. 
So this is an occasion where I think we can all celebrate a little bit. I was strongly supportive of the welfare reform bill that we passed last year. I believe in it. I think it is working. 
At the time when we foresaw the difficulties that were going to come up under this particular group, I supported legislation to take care of them. That did not pass. I believe it was the legislation of the Senator from the State of California. It did not pass. But now we are attacking that problem. 
As I mentioned before, I think it is coming out in a very satisfactory way. So I want to thank the Chair. And, again, I do want to point out that Senator DeWine is deeply interested in this, as is Senator Specter. Senator DeWine may be on the floor a little later. I want to extend my appreciation to his work on this and also to the leadership of both parties in the Senate for permitting this to be accepted. 
Thank you very much.

Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator from Alabama is correct. After numerous conversations with GSA officials, and after receiving the GSA letter my colleague referred to, I have confirmed that the $6 million included in last year's Omnibus Appropriations Act is necessary and appropriate for the courthouse project in Montgomery. Indeed, the additional $6 million will not cause this project to exceed its GSA benchmark cost. As such, I have no objection to GSA obligating these funds and encourage the agency to move expeditiously on this project. 
Mr. President, let me make it clear that absent the extraordinary circumstances faced by this project, I would insist upon authorizing the additional money through the committee resolution process, in accordance with the 1959 Public Buildings Act. As the Senator from Alabama mentioned at the outset, this project has already incurred cost increases as the result of delayed construction starts. A GSA budgeting error on Montgomery has yielded inflationary cost increases of $2.6 million. In addition, the project recently suffered a bid bust which threatens to delay construction further unless additional funds are provided expeditiously. This project must proceed as soon as possible to prevent further wasteful expenses.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to introduce legislation to provide health insurance for millions of children who are not currently covered. Before I talk about the bill, let me take a moment to thank all of the members of the bipartisan coalition who have worked so hard to put this legislation together. Senator Rockefeller, the lead Democratic cosponsor and my colleague on the Finance Committee, deserves very special mention in this regard. Senator Rockefeller has worked for many, many years on these issues and I am personally grateful for all his leadership and hard work in this endeavor. He is a true hero when it comes to America's children. 
There are currently 10 million children in this country who do not have health insurance. Many of these children live in families where one or both parents are working but do not have employee coverage and earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. Others, though eligible, simply fall through the cracks, while still others lose eligibility because of age-based restrictions. This is a tragic problem and our proposal tries to provide real solutions. 
The Chafee-Rockefeller proposal offers the States additional Federal matching funds if they choose to provide Medicaid coverage to all children up to 150 percent of the Federal poverty level. It is a completely voluntary program--we hope that all States will participate, but we leave that decision to the Governors. States, like Rhode Island, that are already providing coverage at these levels will immediately begin to get additional Federal matching funds once they have provided the 1-year continuous coverage. Our bill also provides grant funds for States to use for outreach to the 3 million children who are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled. 
I believe that the Medicaid Program is the best avenue to reach these uninsured children. Expansions in the Medicaid Program over the years have done wonders in increasing coverage for children and pregnant women. We also have to keep an eye on cost, and Medicaid is an inexpensive way to cover children--while half of Medicaid beneficiaries are children, children only account for 15 percent of overall Medicaid spending. And Medicaid is a program that already exists, so we don't have to create a new program or a new bureaucracy. In short, Medicaid works and works well. 
By encouraging States to provide Medicaid coverage to all children under 18 up to 150 percent of poverty, our proposal also tries to fix one of the program's problems: under the current Medicaid program a child's eligibility depends not only on family income, but also on age. 
Let me illustrate this for you: a 6-year-old girl lives in a family of four whose annual income is $21,000. That little girl gets Medicaid because Federal law requires that all children 6 and under be covered up to 133 percent of the Federal poverty level. On her seventh birthday, that little girl doesn't get much of a birthday present--she loses her Medicaid coverage because Federal law only requires that children between the ages of 7 and 13 be covered up to 100 percent of poverty, and her family's income level is slightly above that level. Her 4-year-old brother, however, keeps his Medicaid coverage, at least for the next 2 years. How bizarre that there are two children in the same family and one gets coverage because he's under 6 and the other doesn't because she's older than 6. Our proposal would give States the option to continue Medicaid coverage for both children until they are 18. 
So, I am very pleased to introduce this legislation today along with this distinguished bipartisan group of Senators. I look forward to working together toward the goal of getting critical health care coverage to these children.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I strongly support the Chemical Weapons Convention, a treaty which serves our national security interests in a number of ways. U.S. ratification would help set an international standard that would put political pressure on outlaw nations to rid themselves of chemical arsenals. This treaty will also give our intelligence community valuable new tools to combat illicit production of deadly chemicals, even among nations that do not ratify the convention. 
Mr. President, ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention by the Senate this evening would continue our Nation's proud tradition of leadership in the field of international security. We took the lead in the formation of NATO, on the containment of communism, and on the defeat of Iraqi aggression in the Persian Gulf. This evening, we can again assert our irreplaceable leadership by participating in an effort to ban chemical weapons around the world. 
Mr. President, condition No. 33, which we are now debating, must be stricken in order for the United States to participate in the CWC. Condition No. 33 requires that the President--these are the conditions of condition No. 33--the President of the United States must certify with `a high degree of confidence' that our intelligence community can detect `militarily significant' violations of the convention. 
Now, Mr. President, what does `militarily significant' mean? It is defined as 1 metric ton or more of these chemical weapons. 
Mr. President, this condition is simply impossible to achieve. This condition would bar the U.S. participation in the CWC forever. We must understand that the convention seeks to ban chemical weapons. These weapons, by their very inherent composition, are extremely difficult to detect in relatively small quantities, such as a ton. This truth has been known from the beginning, and no one, Mr. President, has alleged that the CWC will eliminate chemical weapons from the face of the Earth. 
If an individual wants to build a chemical weapon somewhere in a small shack or a cave in some remote area of the world, he or she will always be able to do so, regardless of the outcome of this vote. No treaty, no matter how it is written, will ever be able to stop such an occurrence. Our inability to verify fully the CWC is not a result of any flaws in the convention. It is due to the innate difficulty in monitoring chemical weapons and their components. 
Mr. President, I also question the definition of `militarily significant quantity,' as being 1 metric ton or more of chemical weapons agent. Although 1 metric ton can certainly do a lot of damage, particularly in a terrorist attack, I will defer to military experts to consider what is military significant. In testimony to the Senate, Gen. John Shalikashvili stated that tonnage is not the only factor to consider in assessing the military capacity of these weapons. To transform an illicit chemical stockpile into something militarily useful, an adversary must have vast supplies of these weapons, and he must have an infrastructure for handling them and must have troops trained in the use of these weapons. 
It is these more complex activities--the training of the troops, for example--that the Chemical Weapons Convention, together with our intelligence resources, will be able to verify. As Gen. Brent Scowcroft has testified to the Foreign Relations Committee, under the CWC, it will no longer be possible for a country to buy a few pounds of these chemicals from 
various sources around the world to amass an abnormal supply of chemicals. Our intelligence community has, in fact, indicated on a number of occasions that this convention will provide another tool to the U.S. inventory of ways to stem worldwide expansion of chemical weapons capabilities. In brief, the Chemical Weapons Convention will supplement--it will not replace, but it will add to--ongoing efforts to monitor chemical weapons production worldwide. 
Now, critics of this treaty claim it is unverifiable, that we will not be able to catch adversaries abroad who cheat. But they also allege that the CWC's verification regime, while too weak to catch those cheaters abroad, is too intrusive for American industry. In other words, it won't let us find anything abroad, but it is too intrusive for other nations as far as inspection in the United States. They can't have it both ways. 
The fact is that the Chemical Weapons Convention's verification tools--in other words, how to determine whether there are weapons in other countries--go beyond those of other arms control treaties that we have approved in the Senate in the past. No treaty will ever be able to verify totally a ban on chemical weapons. Condition No. 33 is impossible to meet. The condition that is in this, which we are seeking to strike, is an impossible condition to meet. It serves no purpose other than to prevent U.S. participation in the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty. So I urge my colleagues to support the motion to strike this amendment. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today we celebrate the 27th anniversary of the first Earth Day. In the spirit of that celebration, it behooves us to remember how the first Earth Day came about, and what brought it about. I know the distinguished occupant of the Chair participates in Earth Day activities and is deeply interested and involved in environmental matters. Perhaps he also will be interested in a little history of what happened. 
In the 1960's, a series of events occurred that shocked the Nation into an awareness of the need to protect the environment. Rachel Carson wrote her famous book, `Silent Spring,' in 1962. The country was appalled by her revelations of the destruction caused to our environment by widespread pesticide use--DDT and others, for example. Then, in 1969, another extraordinary event occurred--the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland caught fire. When a river catches fire, it certainly is an eye catcher. Why did it catch fire? It was so polluted with oils and other substances that it suddenly burst into flames. That is, somebody threw a match into the river and it caught fire. Extraordinary. 
So in the early 1960's, a Democratic President, President Lyndon Johnson, laid the foundation for the major environmental laws that came later. He signed antipollution and open space legislation into law, including the creation of the Redwood National Park, the Wilderness Act, and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I might say, Mr. President, it was moneys from that Land and Water Conservation Fund that enabled me, as Governor of our State of Rhode Island, to purchase land for open space, wetlands, and parks. The improvements we made continue to give pleasure to thousands of Rhode Islanders in the past and will do so for literally millions of individuals in the future. That is a wonderful law, the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
When Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin proposed the idea of Earth Day in 1970, even he didn't know how it would galvanize Americans into action, how it would catch the imagination of Americans. The first Earth Day was a phenomenal success, a reflection of America's strong conviction for cleaning up the environment. I can remember some of the activities that took place on Earth Day where I was--cleaning up the riverbeds where there were old tires and dishwashers and refrigerators and many other things thrown over the bank and down into the stream. We took time to clean our nearby streams, as countless others did. Ours was one small activity in one small section of the country, but it made a difference. 
The years that immediately followed the first Earth Day were a vibrant period for environmental legislation. The key players in that legislation, Mr. President, were on the very committee on which you serve so ably, the Environment and Public Works Committee. We remember that Democrats like Jennings Randolph from West Virginia and Ed Muskie from Maine worked closely with several Republicans, including Howard Baker from Tennessee and Bob Stafford from Vermont. Indeed, their success was the result of a nonpartisan, bipartisan cooperation. Magnificent progress was made. 
It is hard to think that, before 1970, none of the laws or institutions that I am going to rattle off existed; but then they passed in 1970, 1971, and 1972. Indeed, under President Richard Nixon, the Environmental Protection Agency was created. We never had an Environmental Protection Agency. The President's Council on Environmental Quality was born; the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, the guiding law upon which so many of our acts depend; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Endangered Species Act. I wasn't here at the time, but the Endangered Species Act passed on the floor of the Senate 92 to 0. That is the way the Senate felt about environmental laws. 
Then another Republican President, Ronald Reagan, had the 
United States take the lead internationally in environmental matters, and we signed the Montreal Protocol in 1987, to eliminate the production of chlorofluorocarbons, the gaseous culprit responsible for the destruction of the ozone layer. It was under still another Republican President, George Bush, that the 1990 Clean Air Amendments were passed. In addition, President Bush personally went to the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro and signed the International Treaty on Global Climate. So we have seen Republicans and Democrats in the White House exhibit strong leadership. This was a bipartisan effort. 
This bipartisanship has brought about tremendous, tangible change. Let us review the bidding to see what has taken place in the past 27 years. Have these acts done a good job--the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Endangered Species Act? It is a remarkable story. 
Before the EPA, before all of the laws now on the books, there was lead in our air and sewage in our rivers. I can remember at the time when I was Secretary of the Navy, we took a trip on the Sequoia, the Presidential yacht, down the Potomac River here in Washington. I invited my British counterpart, the equivalent of our Navy Secretary, to join us. It was a lovely July evening, calm and quiet, not a ripple on the water. As we started down the river, the propeller churned up the water and it was like going for a ride down the sewer. The smells were so overpowering from the polluted river water that we all had to retreat inboard to have our dinner. That is not the way it is now, though. In those days, two-thirds of the rivers, lakes, and streams of the United States were considered nonfishable and nonswimmable. Now the reverse is true. Two-thirds of the rivers and lakes and streams in America are considered fishable and swimmable. Every year that percentage rises. 
What have we done on auto emissions? Well, from 1970 to 1994, the number of vehicle miles traveled in the United States increased by 111 percent, more than a doubling of VMT. Yet, in that same period, the combined emissions of the 6 principal air pollutants dropped by 24 percent. In other words, we had dramatic emissions reductions while vehicle miles traveled shot up. Lead in the air--which everybody knows has a terrible effect on the mental development of children, particularly in congested inner cities--was reduced by 98 percent--a 98-percent reduction of lead in the air. 
How did that come about? Because we mandated the use of unleaded gasoline in the mid-1970s. What an achievement. 
The Montreal Protocol, as I mentioned before, has been a tremendous success. Let's look at this chart. The Montreal Protocol was signed in 1985. Since then, because of the restrictions on the production of chlorofluorocarbons--it is now projected that the ozone layer will gradually recover, and return to pre-ozone-hole levels by the year 2050. What are chlorofluorocarbons? They are cooling agents found in refrigerators and air conditioners in our homes, offices and automobiles. Because of the leadership shown by President Reagan and later President Bush, we have made great progress. This red line shows what would have happened without the controls of the Montreal Protocol. 
Instead, we have been able not only to stabilize chlorine loadings, but actually reduce them. That line will go down and down. All of this has tremendous effects on what comes through this protective shield, the upper atmosphere. 
Now, what about the Endangered Species Act? That is something the Presiding Officer has worked so hard on. The endangered species are--perhaps--the proverbial `canaries in the coal mine'; that is, when a canary keels over, it shows there is dangerous gas. It gives you a hint that something is wrong. 
The best way to judge how successful we have been in preserving the habitat is to look at how the plant and animal species are doing. If the plant and animal life around us is in 
trouble, that means trouble for us in the future. 
The Endangered Species Act is geared toward preserving the habitat. How do you save the animals? You preserve the habitat and thus bring them back from the brink of extinction. Since its enactment in 1973, by a vote of 92 to 0 in this Chamber--not a single Senator in 1973 voted against that law--the populations of whooping cranes, brown pelicans, and the peregrine falcon have come back from near extinction. 
The bald eagle has increased from a low of 400 nesting pairs in 1963 to just over 4,700 pairs in 1995. Think of it. In the Continental United States, the lower 48 States, as they say, there were only 400 nesting pairs of bald eagles in 1963. Thirty-two years later--in 1995--there are now 4,700 nesting pairs. Remarkable. 
The grizzly bear has been saved from extinction and brought back from the endangered list to the threatened list. The California gray whale and American alligator have recovered to the point where they have been removed from the endangered list. 
Of the 960 species currently listed on the endangered species list, more than 40 percent are stable and gaining ground. And for many others the rate of decline has been reduced. 
The recovery of the striped bass is another success story. The striped bass is a magnificent fighting fish, one that has been valued up and down the Atlantic coast for centuries. 
It is interesting to hear what the original settlers said, and what Capt. John Smith said in 1614, over 350 years ago. This is what he said about the striped bass. `I myself, at the turning of the tide, have seen such multitudes pass out of a pond that it seemed to me that one might go over their backs dryshod.' There were so many it seemed you could walk across on their backs. 
So it was with great alarm that we learned of the precipitous decline of the striped bass in the late 1970's. And, by 1983, commercial harvest had dropped by 77 percent as compared to the previous year. By 1983, the sports harvest of striped bass had declined by 85 percent from 4 years earlier. So we inaugurated an Emergency Striped Bass Study by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service. I am proud to say that this legislation came out of the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
And fewer than 20 years later, through the cooperative efforts of State fish and wildlife agencies and the Federal agencies, most Atlantic striped bass stocks have recovered to healthy pre-1979 levels. This dramatic turnaround is proof that, if we act quickly to reduce the threats and preserve habitat, we can recover imperiled species. 
Wetlands loss has slowed dramatically. When it comes to wetlands conservation, perhaps no program has been as successful as the North American Waterfowl Management Plan--signed 11 years ago, in 1986, by the United States and Canada, and later, Mexico. Under this plan, the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, partnerships are established bringing together Federal and local governments, and nonprofit groups such as Ducks Unlimited, and private donors, as well as landowners--to work on the conservation of wetlands, and there are Federal dollars to match private contributions. 
To date, well over 4 million acres have been protected, restored, or enhanced--some of it through easement, and some of it through purchases by the United States and Canada. And 20 million additional acres are protected in Mexico. 
Has it done any good? Listen to this: In 1996, there was the largest migration of waterfowl in the previous 40 years--89.5 million ducks, which is 7 million more than 2 years before, and 18 million more than the year before that migrated south for the winter; 90 million ducks, the largest migration in the past 41 years. That came about because of the North American Waterfowl Plan, which I mentioned before. 
So it seems that the way that the plan operates, involving partnership between the States, the Federal Government, and private entities, it represents the wave of the future, which all of us ought to think about as we ponder how fast we can save these wetlands and wildlife habitat areas. 
We are not done. We should not rest on our laurels. Some of the trickiest and most difficult environmental problems lie ahead, and we have to address these with purpose and ingenuity. We took on the formidable environmental challenges of the past and were successful. Now we look to the future. We shouldn't just rest on 
our laurels, as I said. We have to remember that these efforts can never succeed without strong and sincere bipartisan cooperation--Republicans and Democrats working together; Congress and the administration, likewise. 
In conclusion, I just want to quote probably the greatest environmental President of them all, Teddy Roosevelt. This is what he said 86 years ago. `Of all the questions which can come before this Nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us.' 
Those are pretty good words for us to remember as we celebrate Earth Day in 1997--words to be considered while thinking of the future and preserving the environment for our children and grandchildren and those who come after us.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to commend 25 outstanding students from West Warwick High School in West Warwick, RI, who will be visiting Washington later this month to compete in the national finals of the `We The People . . . The Citizens And The Constitution' program. 
For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with it, the `We The People . . . The Citizens And The Constitution' program is among the most extensive educational programs in the country, developed to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition simulates a congressional hearing in which students' oral presentations are judged on the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles and their ability to apply these principals to contemporary situations. 
Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the `We The People . . . The Citizens And The Constitution' program provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain an informed perspective on the significance of the U.S. Constitution and its place in our history. We hear so much these days about growing apathy and ignorance among young people about our history and governmental traditions. In my view, programs such as this can go a long way to combat these ills. It is heartening to see young Rhode Islanders taking such an active and participatory interest in public affairs. 
Mr. President, you may be interested to know that West Warwick High School has an outstanding track record in the `We The People . . . The Citizens And The Constitution' program. The West Warwick team has won the Rhode Island State competition for 7 of the past 10 years. 
I am very proud of Jamie Amaral, Mary Asselin, Jonathan Bassi, Justin Broz, John Caressimo, Brian Carr, Andrew Constanza, Krystle Couto, Bethany DeBlois, Candice Felske, John Johnson, Jonathan Juneau, Jamie Kullberg, Kristin Larocque, Gina Musto, Meghan O'Brien, Ryan O'Grady, Stephanie Paquet, Erica Ricci, Hillary Sisson, Derek Tevyaw, Kevin Willette, Kristen Wolslegel, Man Yu, and Debra Zenofsky for making it to the national finals. I applaud this terrific group of young men and women for their hard work and perseverance. Also, Mr, President, I want to congratulate Michael Trofi, a fine teacher who deserves so much credit for guiding the West Warwick High School team to the national finals. 
As Mr. Trofi and this fine group of West Warwick High School students prepare for their trip to Washington to compete in the national finals on April 26-28, I want to congratulate them for what they have already achieved and wish them the best of luck in the final competition. These students, with the guidance of Mr. Trofi, have learned what our Nation is all about and what countless men and women have fought and died to protect. No matter what the outcome of the contest is, they have each earned the greatest prize of all: Knowledge.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today Senators Feinstein, D'Amato, Lieberman, DeWine, Moynihan, and Mikulski and I are introducing legislation to protect legal immigrants who are facing the loss of critical SSI and food stamp benefits later this summer. 
Now that the welfare bill has become law, the crisis facing many legal immigrants, especially the elderly and disabled, is all too evident. For those legal immigrants who face the loss of assistance in August and September, the outlook is grim. 
The bill we are introducing focuses on the plight of these legal immigrants. First, our bill grandfathers all legal immigrants who were receiving SSI or food stamp benefits as of August 22, 1996, the date the President signed the welfare bill. Second, our bill grandfathers those refugees who were in the country on August 22, 1996, regardless of whether they were receiving benefits. 
Why this approach? To us, it is a matter of fundamental fairness. That is the principle that underlies our bill. We believe that those who were in this country and playing by the rules should not have the rules suddenly changed out from under them. As for refugees, we provide them a slightly broader provision, since unlike other immigrants they do not have sponsors and they come here to flee persecution. 
This is a matter of great importance to the residents in the States represented before you today. In my own State, a significant percentage of our total population is immigrants, indeed, measured in those terms, Rhode Island is one of the top immigrant States in the country. Some 10,000 legal immigrants in my State rely on SSI and food stamp benefits, quite a lot by RI standards. 
We believe that our approach is a reasonable, commonsense proposal that will appeal to Members on both sides of the aisle and that can be enacted this year. By introducing this bipartisan bill today, we hope to signal to our colleagues the seriousness of our concern and the strength of our resolve. We intend to fight for passage of this bill, and we have every expectation of meeting with success.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this weekend while we are away from the Capitol, an unusual event will occur here. Areas in the Capitol rotunda and the small rotunda, which are ordinarily open to the public, will be closed to visitors, as will the passageway to the majority leader's office. And starting tomorrow, temporary structures will be constructed in these areas. Under the able supervision of the Architect of the Capitol's office, steps are underway to move the statue of Roger Williams, which stands in the rotunda, to the second floor hallway outside of the majority leader's office. 
In February, Senator Warner, chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration, notified me that the statue of Roger Williams would be moved from the rotunda in order to accommodate the so-called portrait monument of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucretia Mott in accordance with a concurrent resolution approved by both houses during the last Congress. While I have no objection to moving the portrait monument to the rotunda, I was disappointed to learn that it would result in the dislocation of the statue of Roger Williams. Senator Warner assured me that the Roger Williams statue would receive an excellent new location and that none of the alternatives--namely in the rotunda--were available. 
Senator Warner certainly kept his word. The new location is very satisfactory. The statue will stand in the second floor hallway between the Senate Chamber and the rotunda, on the way to the majority leader's office. It is a bright and sunny space with windows looking out beyond the West Front of the Capitol to the Washington Monument. The statue of Roger Williams will be in good company, too. Other statues in this area depict Maria L. Sanford, a 19th century Minnesota teacher known as the best loved woman of the North Star State; Edward Douglas White of Louisiana, who served as Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court; John Hanson, who was among the strongest colonial advocates for independence and who served as President of the United States in Congress Assembled under the Articles of Confederation from 1781 to 1782; representing Kentucky is a statue of Ephraim McDowell who was an eminent surgeon and founder of Centre College in Danville, KY; William Edgar Borah, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is best remembered for his integrity, his skills as an orator, and his bipartisanship, and finally; John Middleton Clayton who served in the Delaware State Legislature, the U.S Senate, as chief justice of the Delaware Supreme Court, and as Secretary of State. 
I would like to commend the Architect of the Capitol, Alan Hantman, and his staff, most notably Roberto Miranda, Satish Gupta, and Ralph Atkins, for their extraordinary efforts to protect the statue of Roger Williams as it is transported to its new perch overlooking the National Mall. To ensure the safety of the statue which is quite delicate, it was wrapped in numerous layers of protective materials. First it was completely covered in plastic wrap. Then, it was wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil which was secured with duct tape. Next, it was covered with paraffin wax and a quarter of an inch of latex rubber was applied. All of this was bundled in burlap and a second layer of latex was applied. It was then completely covered with plaster, and tomorrow all of this will be encased in fiberglass. The actual move is expected to occur on Saturday, and on 
Sunday, after the statue is replaced on its base and precisely positioned in the hallway, all of these layers of covering will be removed with the same kind of instrument orthopedic surgeons use to remove casts from patients. I have every confidence in the Architect's office and the office of the Curator that the job of relocating the Roger Williams statue will be skillfully completed. 
As satisfied as I am with all of this, Mr. President, I am submitting a concurrent resolution to return this statue of Roger Williams to the rotunda when the portrait monument is removed. I do this because I believe that the millions of girls and boys, men and women, from all parts of the United States and of the world, should be reminded of the principles for which Roger Williams is known. 
Roger Williams was born in England around 1603 to James and Alice Williams. He grew up in a section of London in which religious dissenters were burned at the stake. Through his personal ingenuity, he gained notice by Sir Edward Coke, who helped young Roger attend school. Later he was able to attend Pembroke Hall in Cambridge University. He was ordained by the Church of England and made chaplain at a manor house in Essex. It was there that he met and married his wife, Mary Barnard. 
By 1629, Roger Williams had accepted many of the views of the Puritans and 1 year later, he and Mary left England aboard the Lyon to start a new life in New England. 
He refused to join the congregation at Boston because of its close ties to the Church of England, and instead, became minister at Salem. The bad blood between Roger Williams and the Boston magistrates led to his departure from Salem. He moved to Plymouth where he joined the Separatist Pilgrims. He remained in Plymouth for 2 years, and eventually became assistant pastor. It was during his time in Plymouth that Roger Williams first became acquainted with and interested in native Americans. 
Eventually he returned to Boston where he found himself again embroiled in controversy, this time because he questioned the validity of the Massachusetts Bay Colony's Charter. Roger Williams pointed out that the King of England had no authority to grant a charter giving away lands that were owned by the native Americans. Of course, this was virtual heresy, and Roger Williams, once again, was banished. 
You can see that Roger Williams was way ahead of his time with his concern for native Americans and that they be paid fairly for their land. Because of this, once again he was banished. 
Leaving his wife and baby daughter behind, he journeyed for 14 weeks through the winter harshness to seek refuge with his native American friends in Narragansett County. In the spring, he was joined by others, but soon this small group of dissenters was forced to uproot themselves again because they were still within the boundaries of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. They traveled across the Seekonk River, landed at Slate Rock on the west side of the Seekonk River and, in gratefulness for the goodness of God to him, he named the area where he was `Providence,' and therefrom came the name of Providence. Subsequently, of course, it was the capital of the State of Rhode Island. 
Roger Williams and his followers purchased land from Canonicus and Miantonomi, the chief sachems of the Narragansett Tribe, and in 1636, founded a new colony devoted to religious freedom and tolerance, the first time in the history of the world that there had been anything like this. 
No one was turned away or banished because of his or her religious beliefs. Roger Williams embraced people of all faiths. In fact, the first synagogue in the New World was built in Newport, RI, and, after joining the Baptist faith, Roger Williams built the first Baptist Church in the New World. Both of these historic and religious landmarks still stand today and are completely operational, a living tribute to Roger Williams. 
Roger Williams was banished time and again for having the courage of his convictions. He believed that every individual should be free to practice whatever faith he chose, a view that today is as integral to our national consciousness as is freedom of expression. He believed in the separation of church and state. And he believed in protecting the rights of those who first inhabited this beautiful land, the native Americans. This weekend, he will be banished once more from the pantheon of leaders with whom he certainly deserves to stand. 
Mr. President, I believe it is only fair for this statue of Roger Williams--in this symbol here you see the picture on the stamp that was issued depicting his settlement in the State of Rhode Island in 1636. 
I believe it only fair for this statue of Roger Williams, his symbol of tolerance, be returned to the Capitol Rotunda. This provision in the concurrent resolution says--the suggestion is that the statue of the women, the so-called monument, will only be there for a temporary period. Indeed, the resolution says that at the conclusion of the temporary display of the suffragettes--how long the temporary period is we are not sure. We are not against the statue of the suffragettes at all. But when that is moved, we ask that the statue of Roger Williams go back into the Rotunda. 
As I say, I have no desire to hasten the removal of the portrait monument. But at the appropriate time, I and my colleagues believe that the Roger Williams statue should be returned. 
So I send the concurrent resolution to the desk, and ask that it be referred to the appropriate committee. 
I thank the Chair.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on March 14, I came to the floor to introduce S. 445, the Waste Tire Recycling, Abatement, and Disposal Act of 1997. Today, I want to make sure that the record is clear on an issue relating to the retreading of radial-type tires. 
It has come to my attention that my remarks regarding retreading have led to some concern on the part of those engaged in the retreading industry. There are approximately 1,440 retreading plants in the United States, and approximately 90 percent of the retreading plants are independently owned small businesses. 
In my oral remarks on March 14, I said `the nature of modern steel belted radial tires makes it very difficult to recycle these tires into new ones. Once upon a time, old tires were retreaded, as we all know. You cannot do that with radial tires.' While that statement is true with regards to recycling rubber from modern radial tires directly into new radial tires, it is not accurate with respect to retreading of radials. 
The Tire Retread Information Bureau and the International Tire and Rubber Association recently provided me with the information on the retreading of tires in 1996, when a total of 29.1 million tires were retreaded in the United States. This breaks down to approximately 4.2 million passenger car tires, 99 percent of them radials; 7 million light truck tires, 80 percent of them radials; and 16.5 million medium truck tires--tires for so-called 18 wheelers, 89 percent of them radials. The remainder are off-road vehicle tires, aircraft tires, and specialty tires. 
My bill, S. 445, recognizes that retreading tires is an environmentally beneficial fate for tires that would otherwise require immediate disposal. Proposed section 4011(d)(1)(B) provides tire retreaders with an exception to the general prohibition on storage of more than 1,500 unshredded waste tires for a period greater than 7 days. This section affirmatively promotes retreading by allowing retreaders to store at their plants the greater of either 2,500 tires; or a number equal to the number of tires to be retreaded over a 30-day period.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. 
Last year, I voted against S. 1936, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996 for several reasons. I felt that the measure rushed to build the interim site before the viability of the permanent site was considered. Also, under last year's bill, NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act, would not have applied until quite late in the game, after great time and resources had been expended. It only would have applied to the licensing of the facility. It wouldn't have applied to construction of the facility at all. Finally, the radiation standards provided in S. 1936 were too lax, and EPA was virtually shut out of the process of setting such standards. Last year's bill was a take-it-or-leave-it proposal, and I chose to leave it. 
When S. 104 was reported by the Energy Committee earlier this year, I had every intention of opposing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, S. 104, again. But this year, the Energy Committee has worked hard to address the concerns that were raised about last year's proposal. After reviewing the changes made in the Murkowski substitute amendment, I have decided to vote in favor of the bill before us. While it is not perfect, the substitute is a significant improvement over last year's bill and this year's bill as reported by the Energy Committee. Is it a perfect bill? Not at all, but it is a far more reasonable solution to a terribly difficult situation than we have ever had before. 
Years ago, Congress rejected reprocessing as an alternative to waste storage. There aren't a lot of options when it comes to disposing of nuclear waste. Either it stays on site, or it goes to a centralized storage facility. I support centralized storage of nuclear waste; however, I believe that the effects of designating a central site must be considered before such a critical decision is reached. 
The Department of Energy is committed to completing a viability study of Yucca Mountain as the permanent repository by the end of next year. Until that study is completed, I feel strongly that there is no reason to go forward with an interim facility at the nearby test site in Nevada. Under last year's bill, as well as the bill reported by the committee, the viability 
study was disregarded. Site preparation and construction would begin upon enactment of the legislation. Senator Bingaman worked closely with Senator Murkowski and the Energy Committee to address this issue. The committee substitute amendment specifically precludes any work, beyond generic design, from going forward at the interim site, before the viability study of Yucca Mountain is completed. I also supported Senator Bingaman's amendment, which would have ensured that the interim storage facility would not become a de facto permanent repository if Yucca Mountain were deemed to be unsuitable. Regrettably, that amendment failed. While I was disappointed with the failure of this amendment, it was not enough to cause me to vote against the bill. Simply put, I believe it is highly unlikely that the viability study will be negative. 
The substitute also strengthens the role of NEPA. Site preparation, construction, and the use of the interim facility are no longer exempt from NEPA. In fact, no construction at the interim site could proceed before an environmental impact statement is completed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This is an enormous improvement over last year's bill, which disregarded NEPA at every step prior to the licensing of the facility. 
The process for setting standards to protect the public from radiation at the Yucca Mountain site also is a marked improvement over previous measures. Rather than setting an arbitrary statutory standard, the substitute incorporates recent recommendations made by the National Academy of Sciences in setting an overall radiation standard for the repository. 
Let me close by saying that the arguments on both sides of this issue have been persuasive. I want to recognize the undaunted persistence of Senators Bryan and Reid in articulating the potential implications of the bill and in arguing relentlessly for the interests of Nevada. I also want to commend Senator Murkowski for his hard work and determination. Senator Murkowski ably managed this very complex measure and was willing to accept suggestions and changes from other Senators that vastly improved the bill. 
The bill, as passed, did not resolve all of my concerns, but it did resolve most of them.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I present to you Rhode Island's outstanding recipients of the highest honors for Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. They have distinguished themselves as community leaders, service volunteers, and mentors for their peers. 
For more than 50 years, artist Norman Rockwell captured in his paintings the spirit and sense of America and its people. A large number of these paintings portrayed Scouts and Scouting. Few other childhood activities better represent the commitment to God, country, and community that is inherent in Scouting. 
Providing girls and boys with tools and leadership skills that will be useful throughout their lives, Scouting is indelibly linked with transforming youths into able, educated, well-rounded adults. Activities like camping, service projects, and weekly meetings aim to build character, encourage responsible citizenship, and develop physical, mental, and emotional fitness. 
The highest honors that a Girl Scout can earn are the Gold and Silver Awards, which are presented to those girls who have shown exemplary commitments to personal excellence and unwavering public service. Likewise, the Eagle Award is the highest honor that can be earned by a Boy Scout. Recipients have displayed the highest achievable skills in outdoor activities and incomparable service records. 
Behind every Girl Scout and Boy Scout troop is a group of similarly dedicated parents and leaders who guide the youths through their achievements.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senators from Georgia, California, and Texas were able to reach agreement with the administration on a resolution addressing certification of Mexico's cooperation in fighting illegal drugs. I have been strongly opposed to a straight or even qualified decertification, which I believe would have undermined U.S. interests and been counterproductive in our efforts to address the scourge of illegal drug use in America. 
I am not here to argue that the situation in Mexico today, with respect to drug trafficking, is in any way acceptable or serves United States interests. The Senators from California, Georgia, and many others deserve commendation for speaking out strongly about the deteriorating condition surrounding anti-drug efforts in Mexico, and the critical imperative that Mexico take stronger action to stem the flow of illegal drugs across its border into the United States. The statistics with which we have become familiar are alarming and worsening: 10.9 percent of children in the United States between 12 and 17 years of age use illegal drugs; Mexico is the source of 70 percent of the marijuana shipped into the United States, and is a transit point for between 50 percent and 70 percent of the cocaine shipped into our Nation; drug arrests and drug seizures in Mexico are only half of what they were just 4 to 5 years ago; there are 52 outstanding United States extradition requests for drug dealers in Mexico, although few, if any, Mexican nationals have been extradited to the United States on drug charges; drug-related corruption has reached the highest levels of the Mexican Government, with the recent arrest of Mexico's highest ranking antidrug official. 
Mr. President, I could go on, but the fact is clear: the Mexican Government, in partnership with the United States, must do a better job of stopping illegal drug production and trafficking. The 10 billion dollars' worth of narcotics that is illegally smuggled from Mexico into the United States each year must be sharply reduced, or even better, eliminated. 
But let's be clear about one thing: Solely addressing the situation in Mexico--the `supply side' of the drug problem--is incomplete and insufficient. Precious little time in the debate on decertification has been devoted to addressing the demand side of this problem, that is, the tragic, insatiable appetite for illegal drugs in the United States. If there were no demand for illegal drugs here at home, the drug kingpins and cartel chiefs that have caused so much misery, would be unemployed. A Washington Post editorial earlier this month makes this point clear, stating `the demand equation remains the true frontline of the war on drugs.' I am pleased that the language agreed to in these negotiations at least in part addresses this critical aspect of our fight against 
drugs. We would be remiss in not putting today's debate in its proper perspective. 
Nevertheless, Congress is right to speak out in an appropriate manner on the deterioration of antidrug efforts in Mexico, and the need to take concrete measures to stem this tide. I would argue that much--not enough, but much--has already been done: the drug certification law passed in 1986, while imperfect, has produced a framework that can produce real results. Nations that receive United States and international assistance are each year held to a very large measure of accountability for their cooperation with the United States in combating drugs. The specter of losing most United States foreign aid and having IMF and World Bank loans vetoed is certainly a strong incentive for governments such as Mexico to cooperate with us and take needed action. 
Despite all of the problems in Mexico, there is evidence that the certification law has compelled Mexico to do more than it would have done were the law not in place. President Zedillo, in particular, has taken a number of steps, including the arrest and firing of thousands of corrupt and criminal individuals in Mexico. His Government has also eradicated an area the equivalent of 5 1/2 times the island of Manhattan. Finally, President Zedillo has declared the drug cartels and the corruption associated with them to be Mexico's principal national security threat. But more needs to be done, and the Clinton administration has the appropriate tools available at its disposal to make further progress on achieving some very important goals. The amendment before us today not only maintains the administration's ability to enhance its cooperation with Mexico, but provides for needed accountability to Congress and the American people. 
On February 28, President Clinton certified to Congress that the Government of Mexico was fully cooperating with the United States in antidrug efforts. The question before the Senate during the past several weeks is should we overrule the President's decision and decertify Mexico? I have argued that, despite the deteriorating situation in Mexico, congressional decertification is the wrong approach, and would actually be counterproductive in solving these problems. I am gratified that the authors of the original decertification resolution have made significant compromises with the administration so that such a vote has been avoided. 
Decertification would have been a slap in the face to our diplomats, who have labored, often painstakingly, to prod the Mexicans to help us crack down on illicit drug trafficking. Not only would it upset these delicate diplomatic efforts, a straight decertification would incite the well-known nationalistic political forces in Mexico, making it even more difficult for President Zedillo to further cooperate with us in achieving the goals all of us share. If it's difficult to work with Mexico now, I shudder to think what would have happened if Congress had overruled the administration by passing a straight or even qualified decertification.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the amendment before us today represents a far more prudent approach to this sensitive issue. It outlines in detail the serious problems involved in Mexico today, and makes it clear that further progress is needed. However, instead of simply clubbing Mexico and walking away, this amendment sets very specific benchmarks for improved antidrug efforts by Mexico, and requires a progress report from the administration by September 1. Among other things, this report must describe the extent to which our two nations have made significant and demonstrable progress on dismantling drug cartels, improving law enforcement relationships, and increasing cooperation on extradition of Mexican drug dealers wanted in the United States. The amendment makes it entirely clear both to this administration and to Mexico where the failings have been and what our priorities are. However, under this compromise, nationalist forces will not be incited in Mexico, and our diplomatic efforts can continue smoothly. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. Thank you.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, all across America, in the small towns and great cities of this country, our heritage as a nation--the physical evidence of our past--is at risk. In virtually every corner of this land, homes in which grandparents and parents grew up, communities and neighborhoods that nurtured vibrant families, schools that were good places to learn and churches and synagogues that were filled on days of prayer, have suffered the ravages of abandonment and decay. 
In the decade from 1980 to 1990, Chicago lost 41,000 housing units through abandonment, Philadelphia 10,000, and St. Louis 7,000. The story in our older small communities has been the same, and the trend continues. It is important to understand that it is not just buildings that we are losing. It is the sense of our past, the vitality of our communities, and the shared values of those precious places. 
We need not stand hopelessly by as passive witnesses to the loss of these irreplaceable historic resources. We can act, and to that end I am introducing today the Historic Homeownership Assistance Act along with my distinguished colleagues, Senator Graham of Florida and Senator Jeffords. 
This legislation is patterned after the existing historic rehabilitation investment tax credit. That legislation has been enormously successful in stimulating private investment in the rehabilitation of buildings of historic importance all across the country. Through its use we have been able to save and reuse a rich and diverse array of historic buildings: landmarks such as Union Station right here in Washington, DC, the Fox River Mills, a mixed use project that was once a derelict paper mill in Appleton, WI, and the Rosa True School, an eight-unit low- and moderate-income rental project in a historic school building in Portland, ME. 
In my own State of Rhode Island, Federal tax incentives stimulated the rehabilitation and commercial reuse of more than 300 historic properties. The properties saved include the Hotel Manisses on Block Island, the former Valley Falls Mills complex in Central Falls, and the Honan Block in Woonsocket. 
The legislation that I am introducing builds on the familiar structure of the existing tax credit, but with a different focus and a 
more modest scope and cost. It is designed to empower the one major constituency that has been barred from using the existing credit--homeowners. Only those persons who rehabilitate or purchase a newly rehabilitated home and occupy it as their principal residence would be entitled to this new credit. There would be no passive losses, no tax shelters and no syndications under this bill. 
Like the existing investment credit, the bill would provide a credit to homeowners equal to 20 percent of the qualified rehabilitation expenditures made on an eligible building which is used as a principal residence by the owner. Eligible buildings are those individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or on a nationally certified State or local historic register, or are contributing buildings in national, State or local historic districts. As is the case with the existing credit, the rehabilitation work would have to be performed in compliance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, although the bill clarifies that such Standards should be interpreted in a manner that takes into consideration economic and technical feasibility. 
The bill allows lower-income homebuyers, who may not have sufficient Federal income tax liability to use a tax credit, to convert the credit to mortgage assistance. The legislation would permit such persons to receive an Historic Rehabilitation Mortgage Credit Certificate which they can use with their bank to obtain a lower interest rate on their mortgage or to lower the amount of their downpayment. 
The credit would be available to condominiums and co-ops, as well as single-family buildings. If a building is rehabilitated by a developer for resale, the credit would pass through to the homeowner. 
One goal of the bill is to provide incentives for middle- and upper-income families to return to older towns and cities. Therefore, the bill does not limit the tax benefits on the basis of income. However, it does impose a cap of $50,000 on the amount of credit which may be taken for a principal residence. 
The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act will make ownership of a rehabilitated older home more affordable for homebuyers of modest incomes. It will encourage more affluent families to claim a stake in older towns and neighborhoods. It affords fiscally stressed cities and towns a way to put abandoned buildings back on the tax rolls, while strengthening their income and sales tax bases. It offers developers, realtors and homebuilders a new realm of economic opportunity in revitalizing decaying buildings. 
In addition to preserving our heritage, extending this credit will provide an important supplemental benefit--it will boost the economy. Every dollar of Federal investment in historic rehabilitation leverages many more from the private sector. Rhode Island, for example, has used the credit to leverage 252 million dollars in private investment. This investment has created more than 10,000 jobs and 187 million dollars in wages. 
The American dream of owning one's own home is a powerful force. This bill can help it come true for those who are prepared to make a personnel commitment to join in the rescue of our priceless heritage. By their actions they can help to revitalize decaying resources of historic importance, create jobs and stimulate economic development, and restore to our older towns and cities a lost sense of purpose and community.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, one of the greatest challenges facing metropolitan areas in our Nation is finding a way to reduce traffic congestion. Commuters in cities across the country spend countless hours on the road traveling to and from work. This traffic places tremendous pressure on our highway infrastructure and causes monumental environmental problems. More than 100 cities fail to meet today's clean air standards. The best way to clean up our air is to reduce the number of automobiles which are driven on a daily basis. 
Unfortunately, our current tax laws actually encourage commuters to travel to work in single occupant automobiles. Today, employers can provide parking to their employees as a tax-free fringe benefit. As part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the value of parking that qualifies for this benefit is limited to $170 per month. By comparison, tax-free transit or van-pool benefits are limited to only $65 per month. 
There is another aspect of this benefit that makes the tax-free parking an even greater incentive for employees to drive to work. The fringe benefit must be offered by employers on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. In other words, the employee has the option of accepting the employer-paid parking or nothing at all. The tax-exempt status of the employer-provided parking is lost if employees are offered a choice between the parking fringe benefit and taxable salary. 
Let me illustrate the problem this creates. Suppose an employer has two employees, Sally and Jim. Under current law, the employer can pay for a parking space at a garage next door. This fringe benefit will not be taxable to Sally and Jim so long as the cost does not exceed $170 per month. But, let's assume that Sally would prefer to receive cash instead of a parking space, because she can commute to work with her husband or take public transportation. The way the law is currently written, Sally's employer cannot offer her cash instead of the parking fringe benefit, because it would cause Jim's parking fringe benefit to become taxable. 
The Commuter Choice Act of 1997, which I am introducing today along with my colleague Senator Moynihan, corrects this bias in the 
Tax Code by allowing employers to offer their employees the choice of tax-free parking or taxable cash compensation. This proposal is completely voluntary. Employers are not required to offer cash in lieu of parking. Furthermore, it has absolutely no affect on employees wishing to continue receiving tax-free parking. That fringe benefit would remain exempt from income and payroll taxes. However, my proposal would allow employees not interested in the parking fringe benefit to opt instead for taxable cash compensation. 
Intuitively, I believe Voluntary Cash Out will have positive revenue consequences for the Federal Government. Some individuals who currently receive tax-free parking will instead opt for taxable cash compensation. For example, trading in a parking space in many cities could be worth almost $2,000 in pretax salary annually, a powerful incentive to consider alternative ways of getting to work. An overwhelming majority of employees receive tax-free parking from their employers--95 percent who drive to work, according to the National Personal Transportation Survey. So, even if only a small portion of this population chooses the taxable cash it should lead to a substantial revenue windfall. 
In 1992, the State of California enacted legislation that required employers with 50 or more employees to offer cash in lieu of parking if the employer subsidized commuter parking. A recent study of eight employers who complied with this law provides some evidence of how businesses and their employees might react to Commuter Choice. For the nearly 1,700 employees of the eight firms, the solo driver share fell from 76 to 63 percent; to carpool share increased from 14 to 23 percent. More importantly, because many employees voluntarily chose taxable cash over tax-exempt parking, State and Federal income tax revenues increased by $56 per employee per year. 
Finally, employer interest in programs like Commuter Choice will increase as pressure builds to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution in our Nation's cities. Many urban areas that are in nonattainment for national air quality standards have incorporated employee commute option programs as part of their State implementation plans. These programs are hampered, however, by the current tax rules, which prohibit employees from trading in tax-free parking for cash and utilizing alternative commute options. The Commuter Choice Act removes that prohibition. 
I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation, which offers greater flexibility to employers and employees, and which will have a substantial positive effect on our air quality.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, a serious environmental problem facing the country today is the loss of open space to development. All across the country, farms, ranches, forests, and wetlands are forced to give way to the pressures for new office buildings, shopping malls, and housing developments. 
America is losing over 4 square miles of land to development every day. In Rhode Island, over 11 thousand acres of farmland have been lost to development since 1974. In many instances, this is simply the natural outgrowth of urbanization of our society. Other times it is the direct result of improper planning at the State and local levels. 
But frequently, the pressure comes from the need to raise funds to pay estate taxes. For those families where undeveloped land represents a significant portion of the estate's total value, the need to pay the tax creates powerful pressure to develop or sell off part or all of the land or to liquidate the timber resources of the land. Because land is appraised by the Internal Revenue Service according to its highest and best use, and such use is often its development value, the effect of the tax is to make retention of undeveloped land impossible. 
In addition, our current estate tax policy results in complicated valuation disputes between the donor's estate and the Internal Revenue Service. In many cases, the additional costs incurred as a result of these disagreements cause a potential donor of a conservation easement to decide not to make the contribution. 
These open spaces improve the quality of life for Americans throughout this great Nation and provide important habitat for fish and wildlife. The question is how do we conserve our most valuable resource during this time of significant budget constraints. 
Mr. President, I think we need to restructure the Nation's estate tax laws to remove the disincentive for private property owners to conserve environmentally significant land. The American Farm and Ranch Protection Act, which I am introducing today along with Senators Baucus and Gregg, will help to achieve this goal by providing an exemption from the estate tax for the value of land that is subject to a qualified, permanent conservation easement. 
This bill is similar to legislation that we introduced during the 104th Congress and was included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. It excludes land subject to a conservation easement from the estate and gift taxes. Development rights retained by the family--most frequently the ability to use the property for a commercial purpose--remain subject to the estate tax. 
In order to target the incentives under this bill to those areas that are truly at risk for development, the bill is limited to land that falls within a 50-mile radius of a metropolitan area, a national park or a national wilderness area, or an urban national forest. 
Conservation easements, which are entirely voluntary, are agreements negotiated by landowners in which a restriction upon the future use of land is imposed in order to conserve those aspects of the land that are publicly significant. To qualify for the estate tax exemption under this bill, such easements must be perpetual and must be made to preserve open space, to protect the natural habitat of fish, wildlife, or plants, to meet a governmental conservation policy, or to preserve a historically important land area. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to save environmentally sensitive open spaces.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation to make some critical reforms to the child welfare system. The goals of the legislation are twofold: to ensure that abused and neglected children are in safe settings, and to move children more rapidly out of the foster care system and into permanent placements. 
While the goal of reunifying children with their biological families is laudable, we should not be encouraging States to return abused or neglected children to homes that are clearly unsafe; regrettably, this is occurring under current law. 
Our legislation would clarify the primacy of safety and health in decisions made about children who have been abused and neglected. The legislation would also push States to identify and enact State laws to address those circumstances in which the rights of the biological parent should be terminated expeditiously (for example, when the parent has been found guilty of felony assault, chronic sexual abuse, or the murder of a sibling). 
The legislation also would provide incentives to move children into permanent placements, either by returning them home when reunification is the goal or by removing barriers to adoption. 
I would like to thank those who have worked so hard to develop this legislation. In particular, Senator Rockefeller, the lead Democratic cosponsor, with whom I have worked for many years on childrens' issues. I also want to thank Senator DeWine, who, as a former prosecutor, brings a good deal of legal expertise and personal experience to this issue. We are also grateful for all Senator Jeffords has done in the past to lay the groundwork for this important legislation. 
My sincere thanks also goes out to the many child advocacy organizations which were so helpful in the development of this legislation. 
Finally, it is encouraging that similar legislation has been introduced in the House by Representatives Camp and Kennelly. While there are minor differences between our bills, the overall goals of both bills are the same. In that regard, I look forward to working with our House counterparts toward the enactment this year of child welfare reform legislation this year.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing, along with my colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan, the National Economic Crossroad Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997, referred to as NEXTEA. NEXTEA is the Clinton administration's legislative proposal for the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. 
I am introducing NEXTEA because it builds upon the landmark ISTEA legislation. It emphasizes environmental protection, system preservation, safety, and intermodalism. I would like to encourage my colleagues to take a serious look at this proposal. 
In addition, I will be a cosponsor of the ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997, a bill that has been written by Senators Moynihan, Lieberman, and Lautenberg which will be introduced in the near future. This proposal also builds upon the program structure and emphasis of the original ISTEA. 
Today's introduction does not mean that I endorse all the ideas in the administration's proposal. I am still in the process of reviewing the bill's details and plan to ask the administration questions about their provisions and the thinking behind some of their proposals. 
Of particular interest to my colleagues is whether my introduction of the administration's bill indicates my endorsement of the administration's formula for distributing funds among the States. It does not. 
The administration's formula relies to a great extent on the contributions paid into the highway trust fund by the individual States. I have serious concerns about setting national policy on the basis of where gasoline is purchased. The Federal Highway Administration's estimate of the highway trust fund contributions is based upon where gasoline is purchased, not even where it is used. Let me give a couple of examples of the problems I see with this misplaced focus. 
If you buy gas in Baltimore, MD, and drive to Woonsocket, RI, you will drive through the States of Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. Maryland will be the only State that gets credit for this trip. 
Even if we were better able to estimate where gasoline is used, rather than just where it is purchased, setting national transportation policy on gasoline usage provides incentives that contradict policies of ISTEA such as environmental protection, intermodalism, and efficiency. Under a gas tax-based formula, States and localities that use transit significantly or use less gasoline because of good planning are actually penalized for their good work. 
For example, programs or policies that encourage any of the following would be penalized: Shifting highway usage to other modes such as transit, greater use of carpooling and High Occupancy Vehicle [HOV] lanes, progressive land use planning, and the use of alternative fuels, or electric vehicles. In other words, `no good deed, goes unpunished' under such a national policy. 
Gasoline taxes are an efficient and low-cost way of raising revenue for transportation purposes. They should not, however, be attributed a policy importance that they do not deserve. 
Let me conclude my statement by encouraging all of the Members of the Senate to work together as we craft an ISTEA reauthorization proposal. I know we have some substantial disagreements that need to be resolved. 
As we move forward, we need to keep in mind the diversity and uniqueness of the country and all of its transportation needs. All of us must resist the temptation to set a national transportation policy based solely on our own region's particular demands. The demands of the Northeast are different from those of the South; the demands of the South are different from those of the West. And so on. 
We need to be cognizant of the population growth that has taken place in the South and Southwest and the strains that such growth has put on areas within that region. Many of the Western States, by contrast, with their low-population density and the great distances involved in travel, rely on highways as the major mode of transportation. We also need to acknowledge the uniqueness of the Northeast United States; its older infrastructure and acute congestion make it more dependent on nonhighway modes such as transit and Amtrak. Attempts to pass a new bill by forming alliances along regional lines will fail unless the bill recognizes the needs of all regions. 
I am hopeful that the ISTEA reauthorization will build upon the strong record of its predecessor. Admittedly, the transition from old policies and practices to those embodied in ISTEA has not always been easy, and more work needs to be done. However, we should not let these bumps in the road cause us to retreat from the progress we have made.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Waste Tire Recycling, Abatement, and Disposal Act of 1997. This is really a reintroduction of legislation I first offered in 1991 to address a very serious environmental hazard. 
What is that hazard I am talking about? It is the very real threat posed by improper disposal and stockpiling of used tires. Unfortunately, the threat posed by improper management of used, scrap tires is as great or greater than when I first introduced this legislation some 6 years ago. 
The scope of the waste tire problem is enormous. Americans generate approximately--think of this--250 million scrap tires per year. That is a tire per person in the United States of America that is disposed of. Over time, approximately 3 billion--not million, 3 billion--of these tires have accumulated in the surface stockpiles throughout our country. 
These used tires pose real threats to the health and welfare of communities. They are places where water is collected, thus mosquitoes breed, some of them encephalitis-carrying mosquitoes. They provide a home for rodents. They are bad news. 
The threats proposed by piles of tires are great also. Few things are worse as far as fires go than to have a pile of rubber tires catch on fire. These can start from lightning or they can start from acts of vandalism. Burning tire piles produce a dense toxic smoke and also produce the oil byproducts that have gone into the making of the tires, and thus we have toxic hydrocarbon compounds. The hydrocarbons so released can soil the air, can soil the soil and, more important, can contaminate surface water and ground water. Often the piles of tires and the fires that result can burn for months and cost millions of dollars to attempt to extinguish. Putting out the fire may just be the tip of the iceberg as there have been released enough toxic substances that, as I say, go into the ground water and cause tremendous problems. 
In my State of Rhode Island, the threat from tire piles is not just an abstraction. Smithfield, RI, is the reluctant host of a tire dump that reportedly is the second largest in the United States. Estimates of the size vary, but the so-called Davis tire pile is thought by our Department of Environmental Management to contain 10 million scrapped tires. This tire pile is close to our reservoir. It is only 4 miles from the principal source of drinking water in our State, the Scituate Reservoir. A major fire at the site could foul the reservoir through a fallout from dense soot and by contamination of the ground water aquifers. 
Nationwide, waste tires are still accumulating in large stockpiles. Why? What happens? Where is the end of this? Well, why have the tire piles grown? There are several reasons. 
First, landfills are reluctant to accept scrap tires. 
Second, the nature of modern steel-belted radial tires makes it very difficult to recycle these into new ones. Once upon a time, old tires were retreaded, as we all know. You cannot do that with radial tires. 
The third reason is that the other markets for the beneficial reuse of this material have been slow to emerge. Scrap tires have some value. They contain a lot of Btu's, more Btu's per pound than most grades of coal and can be burned to produce electricity. Many folks operating tire dumps are hoping for higher energy prices so that there will be a windfall for 
these scrapped tires. However, there is significant opposition to new waste combustion facilities across our country. There is a reluctance to have these waste combustion facilities in one's community. So combustion seems now a less likely option to solve the tire problem. 
And finally, where there are beneficial uses for scrap tires, the processors like what they call clean tires, ones that do not have dirt or rocks or gravel in them. 
The waste tire management program that is contained in my legislation has three purposes. What am I trying to do? First, to assure that scrap tires are managed in a way that reduces the risk of fires and spread of disease. 
Second, the bill would require the elimination of waste tire dumps within 4 years after enactment. It requires that the 3 billion tires in stockpiles across our country be recycled or burned or shredded or buried by the end of the year 2006. 
And finally, the management program is intended to encourage markets for recycled material from tires. 
Now, all of this would take place as an amendment to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, so-called RCRA, with which we are familiar in this body and is already legislation for the Nation. The traditional partnership program between EPA and RCRA through the States will lead to implementation of this program. In other words, it is a partnership between EPA and the States. The bill encourages States to adopt a program to safely manage existing tire piles. The bill authorizes grants to States to develop and implement State programs to manage these piles of tires. 
The bill will limit disease and fire problems. The fire threat will be reduced by including specifications for the size and spacing of these tire piles into smaller, more manageable units, separate them out so that if a fire does start, it does not spread to the entire dump of tires. It also requires provisions that waste tire dumps like the Davis site in my State are closed and the scrap tires shredded and recycled and safely disposed of within 4 years of enactment. So this could take place as soon as the year 2001. Other scrap tire stockpiles that are operating legally under a State permit will have until the year 2006, as I mentioned. 
So all this is accomplished by imposing a 50-cent tax per tire, truck and passenger, on those manufactured or imported into the United States. It just applies to new tires. I want to inform my colleagues that this legislation, once enacted, will solve several solid waste management problems. So I urge my colleagues to join in the support of this. 
As I noted earlier, Rhode Island is host to a site with approximately 10 million of these tires. It has been called the most serious environmental threat to our State. Even after some 250,000 have been removed in order to get at a Superfund site that is underneath these tires, a toxic waste disposal site that was then subsequently covered over by these tires, and even after the State removed some 1.2 million more tires, there still will be 8 million tires left in this Davis site. The threat posed by that is a very real one to my State, as I previously pointed out. So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. It can prevent environmental disasters from taking place. As chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, I will exert every effort to see that these bills become law. 
I thank the Chair and thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut. He is very familiar with this because they have somewhat the same problem, perhaps not in the same magnitude as we have in our State, and they have a tire-shredding program in Oxford, CT. 
So, Mr. President, I send to the desk two bills to accomplish my goal. One includes the tax, the other includes the cleanup efforts. Accompanying this is a summary of these bills.

 Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to commemorate the seventh annual celebration of National Sportsmanship Day, which took place on March 5. Designed to promote ethics, integrity, and good sportsmanship in athletics, National Sportsmanship Day was established by the Institute for International Sport at the University of Rhode Island. This year, over 8000 schools in all 50 States and 75 countries overseas participated in National Sportsmanship Day. 
There seems to be no shortage of stories about assaults on referees, players, and even press photographers. I am particularly pleased, therefore, that the Institute for International Sport tackled the issue of violence in sports head-on. As part of National Sportsmanship Day, the Institute held a day-long town meeting where athletes, coaches, journalists, students, and educators engaged in a lengthy discussion about the causes and possible solutions for violence on the playing field. I think that the Institute's work to foster this kind of dialogue among our young people is critical.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senator from Missouri for his prime work on this piece of legislation. The money that goes into the highway trust fund this year will go out for transportation purposes next year, and I believe that is the right way to do things. It has varied from some of the other proposals that have been put in which provide that the accumulated interest of the accumulated principle of the fund be spent. We don't do that. We provide that what came in last year through taxes will go out the following year for transportation purposes. 
Mr. President, today I join as a cosponsor of the Highway Trust Fund Integrity Act of 1997. This legislation, sponsored by my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, and cosponsored by Senators Nickles, Cochran and Gregg, reestablishes the link between highway trust fund taxes and transportation spending. 
I believe that our proposal represents a reasonable and responsible solution to a problem that faces the Congress as it considers the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. 
I hope that this bill will serve as a starting point for further discussions with my colleagues, especially my colleagues from the Budget and Appropriations committees. I recognize that proposals that modify the budget process are by their nature, controversial, and upset the status quo. However, I think change is necessary and the status quo is no longer an acceptable outcome.

Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished manager of this bill. 
Madam President, I wish to express my wholehearted support for Ambassador Barshefsky. In my dealings with her over the years, I have found her to be a skilled and certainly an expert trade negotiator, who has worked tirelessly on behalf of U.S. interests. I have no doubt as to her integrity and her commitment to this job. And I believe that view is shared by every single member of the Finance Committee, all of whom have worked closely with her. Thus, I urge my colleagues to support her nomination with a strong show of support in the upcoming vote. 
Before we vote on the nomination, Madam President, we must first vote on the amendment to Senate Joint Resolution 5 offered by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings. The amendment requires that any trade agreement that in effect amends U.S. law must be approved by Congress. 
I must say that this amendment puzzles me. Trade agreements to which the United States is a party and the call for changes to U.S. law, have no force of law whatsoever until implementing legislation is passed by Congress. Congress always has the final say. 
The USTR takes pains to ensure that Congress is involved in every step along the way in these trade negotiations. As a member of the Finance Committee, I can personally testify to the fact that the USTR provides regular and, indeed, frequent--indeed, in abundance, a plethora of--briefings on all of the international discussions. 
During 1995 and then again in 1996, the USTR provided literally hundreds of briefings to Members and more than a dozen committees on ongoing trade issues and responded to approximately 200 congressional requests for information every month. That is what was going on in the USTR's office. The Finance Committee staff is briefed exhaustively, as are the staff involved with several other committees. Any Member who has an interest in a particular issue can request personal briefings. That has been the process, not only during this administration but during prior administrations. It is the right process. Trade, obviously, is not solely the privilege of the executive branch but a responsibility conferred by the Constitution on the Congress. 
Do Congress and the administration always agree? Of course not. Indeed, if the disagreement is strong enough, the administration runs the risk of Congress flatly rejecting the arguments in question. Thus, in this process is the built-in enforcement mechanism that constantly keeps individuals in touch. 
So the amendment that is being proposed puzzles me. It does seem to reiterate current process but there are two words that give me pause. The words `in effect.' What exactly does `in effect amend or repeal statutory law of the U.S.' mean? Is it a reference to regulations? Regulations are issued under statutory authority. Is it a reference to the administration officials changing the law by themselves? But the Constitution does not allow that. Only Congress can change U.S. law. 
So it seems that the amendment may be aimed at the recently concluded telecommunications agreement and at certain provisions of that agreement. As I have outlined, the process of negotiating trade agreements takes into account the individual views of Members of Congress. The end results of trade agreements may include certain provisions that some of us do not like. I can clearly remember Senator Danforth of Missouri was not too pleased with the final provisions of the Uruguay Round on subsidies. He did not like it. Yet, he worked with the administration on the implementing legislation and at the end of the day chose to give the agreement his support. 
Disagreement with provisions of final trade agreements is going to happen. Clearly, with 435 Members of the House and 100 Members of the Senate, there are going to be disagreements with the administration. To minimize these, we individually or in groups make sure the administration is aware of our views. We go to the STR during the negotiating sessions and say this is what I am concerned with. This is what we are concerned with in my part of the country. And at the end of the day the agreement may or may not be satisfactory. If we feel strongly enough that it is not satisfactory, we are free to express our views, that is, vote against the proposal, vote against the treaty. 
So my conclusion, Madam President, is twofold. First, it simply is not clear what this amendment would do if it is enacted. Any legislation with an unclear meaning simply, in my judgment, is not wise legislation to enact. 
Second, if the amendment is to express displeasure with a particular provision of, say, the telecommunications agreement, we already have in place a system that takes into account such views. I might also note that I understand from the leadership of the Finance Committee if this amendment, the Hollings amendment, is adopted, it would cause the House to reject consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 5, thus placing the Barshefsky nomination in jeopardy. 
So this is a grave matter, Madam President. It is in the very clear interest of the United States to put in place as soon as possible a strong and effective special trade representative. In other words, Ms. Barshefsky. She needs to be on the job. We have a lot of trade discussions and disputes that are ongoing. Charlene Barshefsky is an absolutely superb advocate and we need to get her confirmed. So for these reasons, I am supporting the nomination and the waiver bill and cannot support the proposed amendment. So I urge my colleagues to reject the Hollings amendmentand to vote for the waiver and for the nomination of Charlene Barshefsky. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, when the Federal Government spends more than it collects in tax revenue, then it must borrow the difference. And when it keeps borrowing, that adds to the debt. 
When we have run up, as we currently have, a $5 trillion national debt, what we are really saying is that is a bill we are passing on to our children and our grandchildren to pay. Currently, for a family of four, the national debt amounts to $80,000, namely $20,000 for every individual in that family, all four individuals. 
As has been mentioned, the interest on the debt is now the third largest item in the Federal budget. This means that money we are spending on interest on the debt is not available for Head Start or health care or better education or improving our parks or all the things we want. 
So, Mr. President, this amendment, balanced budget amendment, which we are voting on will not solve all our problems, but it will be a big step forward, and I hope it passes.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in favor of the resolution which will be before the Senate which would provide for early release of critical international population funds. 
Mr. President, I am deeply distressed by the erosion in the U.S. commitment to international family planning programs. Despite the fact that the United States played a lead role in the U.N. Population Conference in Cairo in 1994, and, indeed, we convinced other nations to increase their contributions to international family planning efforts, in the United States in the past year family planning funds were cut below 35 percent below the previous year, and then additional restrictions were added to that. 
So the net effect was the budget, which previously was $547 billion, has now shrunk to $72 billion this year. These cuts are devastating families around the world. 
According to a recent report released by the Rockefeller Foundation, in 1 year 7 million couples in developing countries will lose access to modern contraceptives, resulting in 4 million unplanned pregnancies. But here is the important part, Mr. President. As a result of lack of family planning and information in these countries around the world, 1.6 million of those unwanted pregnancies will end in abortion. That is the last thing we want. 
Tragically, the international family planning program which we are going to vote on at 2:30 has become bogged down over the debate about abortion. I am perplexed about this, Mr. President. Why should those who oppose family planning also oppose abortion? Or, to put it the other way around, why should those who oppose abortion oppose family planning? Study after study has shown that lack of family planning leads to more unintended pregnancies, which leads to more abortions. 
If we want to end abortions, reduce the number of abortions, it is clear that we should have greater family planning than we currently have. 
Let me illustrate this with an example in two countries. Russia. Russia has very little contraception available and abortion is the primary method of birth control. The average Russian woman has at least four abortions in her lifetime. I am absolutely shocked by that. 
Now let us look at Hungary. Hungary has made family planning services widely available and the abortion rate in that country has dropped dramatically. 
The impact these programs, that is, our family planning programs, have on the health and well-being of women and children around the world just cannot be denied. But there is another issue here that should not be overlooked, and that is the important role that population programs play in improving global environment or sustaining the environment of this globe which we are all traveling around on. 
Listen to these statistics. The Earth now supports 5.7 billion human beings. In 30 years, it is estimated that the world population will grow from 5.7 billion to 8.3 billion, a 46-percent growth in 30 years--a 46-percent growth in the population of this world. We are growing by 86 million people a year; 90 percent of this increase will be in the so-called developing world. 
India, let us take India as an example. India has to feed an additional 16 million people a year, and so many of these additional people that we have in the world are children. And 40 percent of the population of the average less developed nation is under the age of 15. 
To say that this population explosion has put pressure on our natural resources is, of course, a terrific understatement. Over the past 50 years, the Earth is estimated to have lost one-fifth of its topsoil and one-fifth of its tropical rain forests, plus tens of thousands of plant and animal species so important to biodiversity. Overfishing in our oceans combined with pollution has resulted in the plundering of two-thirds of the fisheries of the world. Fifty years ago we had these fisheries. Two-thirds of them are now gone. 
Let us just take a look at Bangladesh. There are 120 million people in Bangladesh, crammed into a country the size of Wisconsin, and that number is expected to rise in this little country the size of Wisconsin, rise from the current 120 million people to 200 million in the next 30 years--200 million people in a country the size of Wisconsin. Overpopulation in that country of Bangladesh and upstream in the Himalayas has led to severe deforestation. The poor people there have cut down every tree in sight. They have used them for firewood. They have used them for building materials. They have tried to clear for farmland. With no trees to hold the topsoil in place, it simply washes away. Overcrowding has forced thousands of people in Bangladesh to settle on land that is nothing more than washed away topsoil deposits from the Ganges and Bramaputra Rivers. That sorry land of Bangladesh is horribly vulnerable to flooding and storm surges. One flood, in 1988, inundated three-quarters of the country, killing tens of thousands of people. 
Now, what can we do about all of this? First, we must focus on education in the developing nations, particularly female literacy. The statistics show absolutely that if we teach young women to read, everything else follows: Greater marriage, greater use of contraception, fewer and healthier 
children, better maternal health and a smaller likelihood of living in poverty. That is the first thing. Educate these folks, particularly the young women. 
Second, the developed nations should do everything they can to influence population growth because that leads to better maternal and child health. Poor health keeps a nation poor and undeveloped. Ironically, poor health even contributes to overpopulation. If parents can be certain that their children will survive, they will invest more in them emotionally and materially and feel less pressure to have additional children. 
So that is the second thing. Do everything we can to improve maternal and child health. 
Third, and most relevant to the matter before us today, the Cairo Conference stressed the importance of redoubling our efforts to increase access to family planning. In the 28 countries that have received the largest amount of family planning funds, the average family size has decreased 40 percent over the past 30 years--a 40 percent decrease in the average population size because of the family planning funds that have been distributed in those nations. 
Mr. President, the United States plays a critical role in providing family planning services abroad. I feel strongly we should continue our leadership role in this area. It is both humane and environmentally sound. I urge my colleagues to support the early release of these family planning funds. In other words, vote for the release of these funds, which we will do shortly after the noon break. 
Mr. President, I also hope that we can in future years increase the funding for these critical programs in our appropriations measures. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President. Last year, the President signed into law bipartisan legislation that provides greater portability of health insurance for working Americans. Today, I join with my colleagues, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Frist, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Collins, in the introduction of a bipartisan bill that will provide some of the same guarantees for Medicare beneficiaries who buy Medicare supplemental insurance or MediGap policies. 
Of the 38 million Medicare beneficiaries, about 80 percent, or 31 million, have some form of Medicare supplemental insurance, whether covered through an employer-sponsored health plan, Medicaid or another public program, or a private MediGap policy. Our bill does several important things for Medicare beneficiaries who have had continuous coverage: 
First, it guarantees that if their plan goes out of business or the beneficiary moves out of a plan service area, he or she can buy another comparable policy. These rules also would apply to a senior who has had coverage under a retiree health plan or Medicare Select if their plan goes out of business. 
Second, it encourages beneficiaries to enroll in Medicare managed care by guaranteeing that they can return to Medicare fee-for-service and, during the first year of enrollment, get back their same MediGap policy if they decide they do not like managed care. Under current law, if a senior wishes to enroll in a Medicare managed care plan, he or she has two options. The MediGap policy may be dropped if the senior chooses a managed care program, or the individual can continue to pay MediGap premiums in the event that the policy is needed again some day--a very costly option for those on fixed incomes. Many seniors fear that if they lose their supplemental policy after entering a managed care plan, it may be financially impossible for them to reenroll in MediGap. 
Third, it bans preexisting condition exclusion periods for Medicare beneficiaries who obtain MediGap policies when they are first eligible for Medicare. Under current law, any time insurers sell a MediGap policy, they can limit or exclude coverage for services related to preexisting health conditions for a 6-month period. 
Fourth, it establishes a guaranteed open enrollment period for those under 65 who become Medicare beneficiaries because they are disabled. Under current Federal law, Medicare beneficiaries are offered a 6-month open enrollment period only if they are 65. There are approximately 5 million Americans who are under 65 years of age and are enrolled in the Medicare program. Currently, they do not have access to MediGap policies unless State laws require insurers to offer policies to them. Our bill provides for a one-time open enrollment period for the current Medicare disabled, which will guarantee access to all MediGap plan options for almost 5 million disabled Americans. 
It is true that this bill does not go as far as some would like. Our bill leaves to the states more controversial issues, such as continuous open enrollment and community rating of MediGap premiums. I believe, however, that this legislation will provide seniors similar guarantees to those that we provided to working Americans under the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would appreciate it if the desk would inform me when I have spoken for 7 minutes. 
Mr. President, when I speak with Rhode Islanders I often find it very difficult to put the budget problems in perspective. Few, if any, of us understand what a billion dollars is, never mind what $1 trillion is But the current national debt of the United States is $5.3 trillion--not billion dollars, not million dollars--trillion dollars. 
So we try to figure how can we put this in some form of perspective and what the national debt is. This is what we owe our children. And the national debt amounts to $20,000 for every American in our Nation, or a bill for a family of four of $80,000. 
Let me give you some idea of what $5 trillion is: $5 trillion is enough money to purchase every automobile ever sold in the United States and have enough money left over to purchase every airline ticket ever sold for travel in the United States. You buy all the automobiles that have been made 
in the history of the United States, and then you have money left over to buy every airline ticket that has ever been sold in the United States, and then you will have used up $5.3 trillion; $5 trillion is equal to the asset value of all the U.S. stocks held by Americans. If we went out to spend a dollar every second of every day to reach the goal of $5 trillion, it would take 158,000 years at a dollar per second. 
When the Federal Government spends more than it collects in tax revenue, it borrows the difference. This debt, obviously, is a liability for future generations. My children, your children, these young people here, the young people all over America are going to have to pick up the bill for what we spent that we didn't collect taxes for. And those who support a balanced budget constitutional amendment such as we have before us believe the Federal Government should do just like a family does. All families in America have to pay their bills. If they don't, they go into bankruptcy and go through a lot of extreme difficulties. But the Federal Government does not pay its bills. It does not collect enough in taxes to pay what we are buying. 
The Governor of California, Earl Warren, once said--I never forgot it--the people of California can have anything they want, anything they want, as long as they are willing to pay for it. And that should be the guiding rule for us in the United States. 
People might say, `Well, sometimes you have to borrow some money.' Sure you do. Thomas Jefferson borrowed $15 million to finance the Louisiana Purchase. And our Nation, obviously, had to borrow money during World War II in the 1940's to pay for that war. No one would argue with those decisions. But when we borrow money, we ought to pay it back and pay it back promptly. That isn't the way the Federal Government works today. 
Mr. President, what this balanced budget amendment is attempting to do is to say if we want something in the United States, then we ought to levy taxes to pay for it. And if we are not willing to levy the taxes to pay for it, whether it is better parks or better education or better health care or better protective services or a stronger FBI or better facilities for our Ambassadors and officials of our Foreign Service serving abroad, all of those things, maybe they are fine. And if they are and if the decision is that they are fine, then let us levy the taxes to pay for it. That is what this amendment is all about. 
Mr. President, I hope that this first step on a long road to balancing our budget will be undertaken. This, of course, does not say we are going to pay off that $5.3 trillion debt. But we will get started on it. First, we will not be adding to it every day of every year. Certainly, for the last 40 years we have spent more than we have taken in. That is why we have the $5.3 trillion deficit. 
Mr. President, I think that this balanced budget amendment is a good start. I hope it will be approved. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation which will allow the private sector to take a more active role in building and operating our Nation's highway infrastructure. The Highway Infrastructure Privatization Act will allow the private sector to gain access to tax-exempt bond financing for a limited number of highway projects. I am pleased that my distinguished colleagues, Senators Warner, Moynihan, and Bond, have agreed to join me in this effort. 
One needs only to venture a few blocks from here to see the terrible condition of many of the Nation's roads and bridges. Regrettably, the United States faces a significant shortfall in funding for our highway and bridge infrastructure needs. 
The investment need comes at a time when we in Congress are desperately looking for ways to reduce spending to balance the budget. State governments face similar budget pressures. It is incumbent upon us to look at new and innovative ways to make the most of limited resources to address significant needs. 
In the United States, highway and bridge infrastructure is the responsibility of the Government. Governments build, own, and operate public highways, roads, and bridges. In many other countries, however, the private sector, and private capital, construct and operate important facilities. These countries have found that increasing the private sector's role in major highway transportation projects offers opportunities for construction cost savings and more efficient operation. They also open the door for new construction techniques and technologies. 
To help meet the Nation's infrastructure needs, we must take advantage of private sector resources by opening up avenues for the private sector to take the lead in designing, constructing, financing, and operating highway facilities. 
A substantial barrier to private sector participation in the provision of highway infrastructure is the cost of capital. Under current Federal tax law, highways built by Government can be financed using tax-exempt debt, but those built by the private sector, or those with 
substantial private sector participation, cannot. As a result, public/private partnerships in the provision of highway facilities are unlikely to materialize, despite the potential efficiencies in design, construction, and operation offered by such arrangements. 
To increase the amount of private sector participation in the provision of highway infrastructure, the Tax Code's bias against private sector participation must be addressed. 
The Highway Infrastructure Privatization Act creates a pilot program aimed at encouraging the private sector to help meet the transportation infrastructure needs for the 21st century. It makes tax-exempt financing available for a total of 15 highway privatization projects. The total face value of bonds that can be issued under this program is limited to $25 billion. 
The 15 projects authorized under the program will be selected by the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. To qualify under this program, projects selected must: serve the general public; be on publicly owned rights-of-way; revert to public ownership; and, come from a State's 20-year transportation plan. These criteria ensure that the projects selected meet a State or locality's broad transportation goals. 
A revenue estimate for this legislation has not yet been completed, however we anticipate that the bill will not result in a revenue loss for the Federal Government. The projects that are candidates to participate in this pilot program are ones that are likely to be funded by tax-exempt bonds issued by State and local governments. Therefore, the bill should not result in an increase in the amount of tax-exempt bonds that will be issued. Furthermore, it is possible, depending on the efficiencies resulting from substantial private sector participation, that the bill actually would result in fewer bonds being issued and therefore would provide a revenue increase for the Federal Government. 
The bonds issued under this pilot program will be subject to the rules and regulations governing private activity bonds. Moreover, the bonds issued under the program will not count against a State's tax-exempt volume cap. 
This legislation has been endorsed by Project America, a coalition dedicated to improving our Nation's infrastructure, and the Public Securities Association. 
I hope that this bill can be one in a series of new approaches to meeting our substantial transportation infrastructure needs and will be one of the approaches that will help us find more efficient methods to design and to build the Nation's transportation infrastructure. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this important initiative.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation which makes permanent the full value deduction for gifts of appreciated stock to private foundations. I am pleased that my distinguished colleagues, Senator Moynihan and Senator Abraham, have agreed to join me in this effort. 
Since 1984, donors have been allowed to deduct the full fair market value of certain gifts of public traded stock to private foundations. This provision of the tax code was added as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 to encourage individuals to create foundations during their lifetime. Unfortunately, when this section was enacted it included a sunset date of December 31, 1994 which was extended through May 31, 1997 as part of the Small Business Jobs Protection Act. Without this provision, the number of new foundations--as well as additional endowments to existing foundations--is likely to fall off dramatically. 
Private foundations are nonprofit organizations that support charitable activities in order to serve the common good. They provide support by making grants to other nonprofit agencies, or through operating their own programs. In some cases, such as scholarships and disaster relief, foundations may make grants to individuals. 
Foundations are created with endowments--money given by individuals, families, or corporations. They make grants or operate programs with the income earned from investing the endowments. Since most foundations have permanent endowments, they do not need to raise funds each year from the public in order to continue their work. Freed from these constraints, foundations are perfectly positioned to act as the research and development arm of society. 
In a 1965 Report on Private Foundations, the Treasury Department recognized the special nature of foundations by describing them as `uniquely qualified to initiate thought and action, experiment with new untried ventures, dissent from prevailing attitudes, and act quickly and flexibly.' Indeed, foundations reflect the innovative spirit of the individuals and corporations that endow them. 
There are more than 34,000 private foundations in America today that provide over $9 billion annually to support innumerable projects, large and small. Among other things, they help the poor and disadvantaged, advance scientific and medical research, and strengthen the American educational system. 
Let me give you a few examples of some of the medical advances that have occurred as a result of the financial assistance provided by private foundations: The polio vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953 after the Sarah Scaife Foundation provided him with the money he needed to establish and equip his virus laboratory. 
With the help of the Commonwealth Fund, Dr. Papanicolaou discovered in 1923 that cervical cancer could be diagnosed before a woman presented any symptoms. That breakthrough led to the basic and now routine diagnostic technique known as the Pap smear. 
In 1951, Dr. Max Theiler received the Nobel Prize in medicine for his work in developing the yellow fever vaccine. That effort was the direct result of a 30-year, all-out commitment by the Rockefeller Foundation to eradicate this disease. 
But, Mr. President, private foundations have been involved in many more aspects of our daily lives than simply funding medical advances. Dr. John V.N. Dorr was an engineer in the early 1950's. He speculated that many accidents occurring on our Nation's highways during inclement weather were the result of drivers hugging the white lines painted in the middle of the road. Dorr believed that if similar lines were painted on the shoulder side of the road, lives could be saved. 
Dorr convinced transportation engineers in Westchester County, NY, to test his theory along a particularly treacherous stretch of highway. The dropoff in accidents along this part of the road was dramatic, and Dr. Dorr used his own foundation to publicize the demonstration's results nationally. Today, although State funds are now used to paint white lines on the shoulder side of the Nation's highways, every person traveling in motor vehicles is indebted to Dorr and his foundation for implementing this lifesaving discovery. 
As these examples indicate, private foundations provide a great many benefits to our society. By permanently extending this tax incentive, we can continue to encourage individuals to dedicate a substantial portion of their wealth to public, rather than private purposes. I hope my colleagues will support this legislation. 
Our bill permanently extends the tax incentive for an individual who contributes stock to a private foundation. This provision currently expires on May 31, 1997. 
Under this bill, a taxpayer who contributes publicly traded stock to a private foundation would be allowed a deduction for the full fair market value of the stock. Absent this legislation, the deduction would be limited to the cost basis of the stock, which for many donors effectively eliminates the incentive to make the donation. 
The legislation also conforms the due date for a private foundation's first quarter estimated tax payment with the filing date for the annual tax return. Currently, a private foundation is required to make its first quarter estimated tax payment on April 15, even though the annual income tax return is not due until May 15. Under this bill, a foundation's first estimated tax payment would be due on May 15. 
Finally, the bill also simplifies the rules governing distributions from a private foundation to a charity located outside the United States. 
A similar proposal introduced in the 104th Congress was estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation to cost $287 million over 5 years.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, Senator Smith from New Hampshire and I have been working on this not only this year, but in past years also. I think after 7 years, it is time to fix this program. Tens of billions of dollars have been spent with very modest results, as far as cleanups go. This bill, which Senator Smith and I have submitted, addresses the so-called brownfields problem, for example. 
What are brownfields? They are contaminated sites, usually within our cities, which can be cleaned up relatively quickly and inexpensively and can be returned to productive industrial commercial use, thereby generating jobs and revenue. 
In this legislation, we deal with who will have to pay. Obviously, this is where the intense legal arguments have occurred, where you need to hire a hall because there are so many lawyers involved. 
We eliminate the unfairness of joint and several liability at most sites, and we replace it with proportional allocations where each polluter pays its fair share. 
We eliminate from liability anyone who legally sent waste to a municipal landfill. 
We eliminate small businesses and persons whose share was less than 1 percent and persons who sent less than 200 pounds or 110 gallons. 
In deciding how clean the cleanup ought to be, we take into consideration, what is the future use of the site going to be? Is it going to be for a children's playground, or is it going to be for a parking lot that is paved? Obviously, it makes a difference as to how clean the site should be cleaned up. 
Mr. President, this bill is not written in concrete. Senator Abraham, for example, is deeply concerned that we do not include here within our legislation tax incentives for brownfields cleanup in empowerment zones and in enterprise communities. Senator Abraham, who is deeply concerned about our inner cities and the jobs that will flow from it if these sites within the inner cities are cleaned up, believes there should be some tax incentives provided. We have not done that because of a cost problem, but we have assured Senator Abraham we will work with him to try to come up with the result that he seeks. I want to commend Senator Abraham for the work that he has done on this and the intense concern he has shown throughout the process of formulating this legislation. 
Mr. President, now I would like to turn it over to Senator Smith who has labored so hard in this vineyard, not only this year but last year. I do not think anybody in this Senate knows more about this legislation or has worked harder on it than Senator Smith from New Hampshire.

Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to stress the comments that Senator Smith made about a bipartisan approach. 
As I mentioned before, this is legislation that we worked on. We believe it is very, very good legislation. We are not saying it is the end all and be all. Obviously, in our committee we will have hearings on it. All the members of the committee will have a chance to have their views expressed. 
We look forward to contributions from the members of the Democratic Party who are part of our Environment Committee. It is our hope that when we come forward with a bill to present on this floor finally for consideration by the body, that it will come out unanimously from our committee, will have the support of the administration, and will fulfill the desires of all of us that this legislation become law.
